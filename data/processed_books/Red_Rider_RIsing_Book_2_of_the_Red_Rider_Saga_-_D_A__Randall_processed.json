PRAISE FOR The Red Rider Saga (from previous editions) “I got sucked in from the beginning. … I was up all night reading, imagining and feeling for this poor girl … heartbreak and twists and adventure all rolled into one. … This is a book to let a young woman read to teach about inner strength and what one young girl can do against so many odds. That one action can accomplish so much. This book gets my absolute seal of approval. I could even picture this story on the big screen! Angi Burns ~Rabid Readers Book Blog ( ( ( “Get ready to see the classic tale reimagined as you’ve never seen it before. … transforming a children’s fairy tale into a supernatural action thriller with a Zorro-style vigilante.” A.K. Preston, author of The Gevaudan Project ( ( ( “A thrilling paranormal Red Riding Hood. … a well-written retelling with a twist and a much stronger Red. … would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal thrillers or reimagined fairy tales. C.S. Wachter, author of The Sorcerer’s Bane ( ( ( 1 “Action filled novel. Journey of a teenage girl. A story of love, courage, friendship and more. The author has got it all in this book.” Jay Deb, author of The Assassin ( ( ( “[Randall]’s unauthorized sequel to Little Red Riding Hood blends great characters with a compelling storyline and places it in the middle of a legendary premisè… a well-told story about seeking justice rather than revenge and finding a way to properly overcome evil. What I liked best about this tale was that this little girl was a flawed character—and she seemed to have all rights to believe the way she believed and think the way she thinks—but [Randall] is careful not to glorify the fact she wants revenge. In fact, the story is about Red learning through her quest to destroy the wolves that revenge will, in fact, destroy herself. It’s a big concept and [Randall] does it well.” Josh Olds, Life is Story ( ( ( “There are stories with great writing styles. Those that have amazing plots. Those that sustain your attention with every word. Ones that exceed your expectations of great lines, with a satisfying ending. Mr. [Randall] accomplished all of these aspects. I can only hope that the right person will come across The Red Rider and turn it into a movie that is sure to be a box-office hit.” Kym McNabney, Story Contributor, Childhood Regained: Stories of Hope for Asian Child Workers by Jodie Renner and Steve Hooley 2 WHAT READERS ARE SAYING (from previous editions) “Full of thrilling discoveries and heart-pounding adventure! Helena “Red” is as complex, driven, and bold as Katniss Everdeen (Hunger Games). You will be cheering for her from the start!” ( ( ( “This book was fantastic!!!!!!! Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. A fantastic twist on the original Red Riding Hood. Helena is my hero.” ( ( ( “Fantastic, suspenseful retelling of Red Riding Hood. A story of wolves and black magic. How the beautiful, innocent child Helena, becomes the physically scarred, determined, skillful hunter of wolves. How the stuff of nightmares becomes reality for a whole community, and a young woman's strength and overwhelming desire to completely destroy the terror that haunts her dreams and waking moments. Powerful imagery, wonderful storytelling. I thoroughly recommend it.” ( ( ( “Definitely not what I expected. There were plenty of twists and turns packed into this book. A good read for any fairytale/fantasy lover.” ( ( ( “While the story takes place in France a long time ago, it has a contemporary feel to it, and the story moves quickly. You find yourself rooting for the main character. I'll certainly buy the next [D.A. Randall] novel if it's as good as this one.” ( ( ( 3 “The Red Rider is a well written book full of adventure, mystery, twists and turns with a fair amount of moral teachings included. This is a book that would be excellent for young teens and adults alike.” ( ( ( “If you enjoyed Little Red Riding Hood as a child, you will love this book. It has mystery, adventure, and suspense. Once you start to read it you won't be able to stop until you finish it. This is the first time I have read anything by this author but he has found a fan of his writings. He is an amazing storyteller.” ( ( ( “Imagine Little Red Riding Hood being scarred by her traumatic encounter with the big bad wolf, and imagine that the big bad wolf ‘isn't a wolf.’ Then let her grow into an angry teenager, give her a red cape, a reloading crossbow and a grappling hook, and gallop with her on her one-supergirl-war against a coven of big bad wolves. The Red Rider is a teen action-fantasy hero and that is how the novel reads. No spoilers here: The suspense with author [D.A. Randall] is just how dark this fantasy will turn, as he takes the white-washed premise of the Brothers Grimm and gets much, much grimmer. A great fit with the grown-up fairy-tale versions of recent years that has emerged in print and film. I recommend it with pleasure. ( ( ( 4 5 RED RIDER RISING by D.A.

RANDALL NEWSLETTER RANDALL ALLEN DUNN ACTION THRILLERS 11 MY SCARS 12 13 1. I never meant to become this. The lazy breeze made my red hooded cloak waft about my shoulders as I sat atop my horse, my cheeks warmed by the consuming blaze. The same gentle wind lifted the roaring flames higher and higher, racing through every inch of the building. I could do nothing to silence the screams of the men inside as they shouted my name. The name they had given me. “Rider! Rider!” Nothing to change what I had become. 14 It was not entirely my choice. I had not started this war, nor had I planned to become a sixteen-year old warrior. I started out as a little girl, innocent as any other. Enjoying life, enjoying my family, anticipating a happy future. Until they had disrupted my entire world, nearly a decade ago … “Hit her again, harder!” Egged on by his friends, Jacque Denue had smiled and rammed his fist into my gut. The jarring pain had shaken my prone body, making me want to vomit. I held back the bile, since the other four boys had me pinned and I didn’t want to swallow it back down my throat. At least the early morning rain had muddied the ground enough for me to sink into it, while it ruined my little dress and burlap cloak. When would Papa come back with the wagon? I was too hoarse to scream any more. I could only raise an arm or a leg as much as they let me, curling into a weak ball to protect myself. The village boys laughed as they took turns punching at my stomach, chest, arms, groin and face. My horrible, scarred face that helped them justify their attack. “You sick, ugly witch!” Jacque spat. “You stay out of La Rue Sauvage, you hear? Stay out of our village!” His palm weaved around my arms and slapped me. Tiny lights swirled about my face as 15 the sting settled into my cheek. I wanted to sleep. To sleep forever and make them go away. “Monster!” one boy yelled. “Disgusting hag!” shouted another. I stopped trying to rise from beneath them. I shut my eyes, accepting blow after blow, my arms and legs burning with bruises. I no longer saw them. I saw myself and the image they so hated. The seven-year old girl with blonde hair and blue eyes and three thick scars slashed across her face. They ran at a slant, like torn pink ribbons. The top one started above my left eye and ended below my right. The second ran below my left eye and scraped across my distorted nose. The last tore across my left cheek and my mouth, ending beneath the enlarged right portion of my lower lip. No wonder they called me a monster. My mind pictured something else as they kept hammering my stomach. I saw the wolf, large and leering and unstoppable, its jaws opening wide to swallow me. The wolf that stood on its hind legs and loomed over me. The living nightmare that spoke to me through its grinning fangs: Where are you going, little girl? I found my voice and screamed. “Helena!” “Run!” the boys shouted. The pain stopped – or at least, stopped mounting - replaced by a scuttling and sloshing of feet through mud puddles and fallen leaves. “Helena! What have you boys done? Come back here, you!” 16 I kept my eyes shut and lay still, sobbing but relieved. Papa would stop them. He would chase them, punish them, his blue eyes blazing with rage above his thick black moustache. He would catch every last one of them and make them sorry for hitting me. Strong arms surrounded me. They snatched me up, then slowed to cradle me. “Helena.” Papa’s voice broke. “Helena.” “Papa,” I rasped, too weak to hug him. I winced out tears as he held me, keeping my eyes closed, until I could breathe regularly again. “Did you get them?” His chest sighed. “They ran away.” “All of them? You didn’t catch any?” My voice croaked like a frog’s. “Helena, I’m taking you to Doctor Renoire.” He rushed me to the next street where we had left our wagon. I had wandered off to smell some flowers outside another shop, when the boys started hurling insults and chased me through the alley. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa cradled me closer as he sloshed across the muddy path. My burlap cloak scraped against my bare shoulders where my dress had been torn. “I’m taking you to the doctor,” he said. “Am I dying?” “No, Helena. You’re not dying.” “After we’re done – I want to see him.” “I’ll think on it. Lie still.” He laid me down on the hay in the bed of our wagon, pushing aside the pumpkins and squash 17 he had purchased to make room. I heard Papa’s horse, Royale, snort his readiness from the front. Soon we were rolling and jostling along the dusty road, so much smoother than the hills outside our distant cottage. So smooth … And I was so scarred. 18 2. I still felt pain, stinging my stomach and face and between my legs, as I lay on the cot in the visiting room. But Doctor Renoire had cleaned me with soft cloths and lotion that took away most of the soreness. Soonafter, I had been able to sit up and eat some of the crackers he kept in his house. He and Papa had left me alone to rest. I laid there as I had been told. Until I heard them talking out in the parlor. I slid down from the cot, wincing at new aches knifing into my thighs and lower back. My 19 ripped, muddy dress had been thrown away. I now wore a pair of boy’s trousers and a shirt, which Doctor Renoire had borrowed from his son’s wardrobe. Only one item had been rescued, and lay on the table beside the cot. My burlap cloak. At least the dark bloodstain in the center gave it some color. I pulled it about my shoulders and hobbled to the door, the wooden floor chilling my bare feet. I peered through the crack and listened. Papa leaned forward in a chair, burying his face in his hands. Doctor Renoire kept a hand on his shoulder. “Relax, Henri,” he said. “Helena’s going to be all right.” Papa sat up and wiped away tears. “This is why. This is why we don’t come out any more. Why we can’t.” “Because of her face?” “No. Not exactly. I just don’t want her suffering any more harm.” My cloak scraped my bruised forearm as I draped it tighter about myself. Doctor Renoire stared at the floorboards. “When Father Vestille brought her in last spring – I had never seen anything like it. At least, not anyone who survived. And certainly no child.” My breath grew quick and shallow. My skin bristled at the memories that still filled my nightmares. The wolf that spoke to me in the forest, that killed Grand’Mere Marie and tried to kill me. The wolf that was anything but a wolf. 20 Doctor Renoire knelt before my father. “Perhaps it’s distasteful to say, but you really should be so grateful, Henri. Just grateful to have her.” “I know. We are. That’s why we can’t let her go out. Not until we can know this won’t happen again.” My foot shuffled against the floor. They both turned. I opened the door slowly as if I had just arrived. Papa quickly wiped his face. “Helena. How do you feel?” “A little better.” “Come here, Helena,” Doctor Renoire beckoned, still kneeling. I limped toward him, feeling some of my strength returning. “That’s it. Good girl. You’re walking fine. You just need to rest up for a few days. Your father agreed to let you skip some chores the next few weeks while you recover. But you should be up and around in no time. Nothing seems to be broken and you’re already moving around much better.” They smiled. They seemed to be waiting for me to respond in kind, so I smiled back. “You know, Helena,” Doctor Renoire continued. “I’ve never seen a girl recover so quickly. You survived six months ago and again today. You’re fortunate to be alive, both times. You’re a true miracle.” My smile faded. “I don’t feel like a miracle.” 21 I clutched at my sore ribs as we trudged through the leaves littering the cobblestone street. I was eager to barter for a new dress at the village clothier and return the trousers that felt so strange, clinging to my legs and exposing them in public. We rarely visited the brick shops and stone houses of La Rue Sauvage. It seemed aptly named now: “Wild Street”. I had begged Papa to take me with him today, but he would never allow it again. Perhaps my parents were right to keep me close to home, never venturing too far outside. Where the wolf might be waiting. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa said nothing at first. “You need to rest. We came to the village. That should be enough excitement for one day, don’t you think?” I heard laughter and flinched. A few men strolled by in front of us, chuckling. Not Jacque Denue or his friends. “I want to see Francois. Please, Papa.” He sighed. “I’ll think on it. Let’s focus on finding a new dress.” We arrived at the clothier and stepped up onto its stoop. The store sign suddenly flipped over to show it now closed as the front door slammed. Papa held my hand and stood in the empty street, staring at the shop door. The sign above the door read: Clothier de Denue. I never knew Jacque’s father sold clothes. He must have heard about what happened. Now he wouldn’t speak to us, out of shame. Or fear. Papa’s hand tightened on mine. His moustache twitched as he clenched his jaw, before 22 he turned me away from the closed door. “Come on, Helena.” I glanced back at the shop. An eye peered out from a crack in the window shutter. Then it disappeared. “We’re not getting a dress?” “Your mother can make you a quick one, perhaps by tomorrow. We’ll ask Doctor Renoire to let us keep these clothes another week. We’re going to see Francois.” My heart soared. “Oh, thank you, Papa!” I nearly threw my arms around him. Then I slowed myself to hug him without upsetting the pain in my ribs. He knew I needed to visit Francois, especially today. Sometimes Francois was the only person who could make me feel safe. Especially when I remembered the wolf. Papa marched to the wagon without a word. He studied the noonday sun. He never let me travel all the way from La Rue Sauvage to Francois’ cabin this late in the day, for fear of being out after dark. He never felt anything was worth that risk. We had to hurry. I tightened my burlap cloak against a draft, scraping my bruises. I glanced back at the shop to see the eye staring at me again before it vanished. Jacque Denue’s father was smart to stay hidden. Papa was no coward. But why didn’t he even knock on the door when we both knew Monsieur Denue was there? Why didn’t he kick the door open and make him give me a new dress for the way his son treated me? Why wouldn’t anyone help me? 23 3. As our wagon rolled up the muddy path to his cabin, I spotted Francois chopping wood outside and smiled. I loved watching his strong arms hammer down on a log with his silver ax. He was a burly man with a round belly and a scraggly beard that crinkled up in a grin whenever he saw me. A wave of warm sunshine bathed me from inside. For the first time since I saw him last month, I felt as though nothing could harm me. Papa tugged Royale to a stop. I wanted to scramble down from the wagon without waiting 24 for permission. But the pain in my side and my legs nearly slowed me to a halt. “Easy, Helena,” Papa said. I hobbled over to Francois as fast as I could, ready for him to scoop me up into his broad arms like always. He thumped his ax into the wood and hurried to me with a fat smile. “Well, well, Helena! What brings you all the way out here?” he boomed. He frowned upon seeing me limp and the pants I now wore. “What happened?” I started to tell him, but I couldn’t. I fell against him and wept, letting my itchy cloak fall to the mud. He hoisted me into the air, but didn’t swing me around in a big circle. Instead, he cradled me like a bear holding a tiny cub. I nuzzled against his warm chest, covered with wooden chips and dust. He patted my back and hugged me. With his heavy arms, who needed a cloak? “It’s all right, Mademoiselle. It’s all right.” “Some boys in the village,” I blubbered. “They chased me and hit me and wouldn’t stop.” “Andre Denue’s son and some of his friends,” Papa said, striding up from behind. “He wouldn’t even open his door to let us buy a new dress. These are from Doctor Renoire’s son.” I sniffed and swiped a tear from my cheek, brushing one of my triple scars. “They called me a monster.” Francois’ hands clenched against my back, then relaxed. “You’re no monster. You just had some bad luck, that’s all. Don’t pay no attention to 25 those morons. Sounds to me like a bunch of no-good bullies.” “I wish you’d been there. Papa let them get away.” Francois held me a moment longer. Then he gently set me down and knelt before me. His eyes looked worried. “Now listen, Helena. If I’d been there, I couldn’t have done anything more than what your father did.” I glanced back to see Papa staring at the ground. I started to tremble. I never meant to dishonor him. I just wanted someone to protect me. Francois’ large finger turned my chin back toward him. “I’m betting your father took you straight to the doctor, didn’t he? And you’re here in one piece. Aren’t you? I expect he was more concerned about treating your wounds than getting revenge.” My face screwed up with tears again. I fell against Francois and sobbed. Ashamed of the way I had spoken about Papa. Angry at Jacque Denue and his friends for nearly beating me to death. And terrified of facing them – or anyone – again. Afraid of showing my horrid face. “Helena. Your cloak,” Papa said. I turned. He held the burlap cloak out to me. I took it with a faint smile, then draped it back in place, careful to keep it from scraping my shoulders too much. Francois patted my back. “Dry your tears now. I’m glad you came today. Been wanting to 26 show you something, next time I saw you. Come on back.” He wiped my eyes with the tail of his thick tunic. I smeared away the rest with the back of my fist. He led me like a lamb, his large hand around my shoulder, toward the rear of his stable. I smiled, eager to see Francois’ ebony horse, Lightning, named for the jagged stripe that covered her nose. I always felt better after petting her. As we came around the corner, Lightning lifted her head lazily. A colt jerked its head from beneath her. It rose to face us, stamping its hooves in protest. Its flanks were red like flame. I gaped. “What’s that?” “That,” he said, “is our new colt.” Its blazing eyes locked on mine. “She’s red!” I squealed. My cloak fell off my shoulders again as I hobbled forward. “Whoa! Stop!” Francois shouted as Papa also yelled behind him. I limped to the gate as fast as I could. The fiery colt reared back, then ran at me. “Helena!” Papa cried. Francois tugged me back as the colt stamped and kicked at the gate. “Easy now, that colt’s a wild one. Understand? Don’t move too quick around it, you’ll pay for it.” I stared into the colt’s eyes. It did look dangerous, but that seemed all right somehow. It didn’t seem mean, just frightened and ready to fight. The same way I felt, except I didn’t have 27 hooves to kick against a gate. “Let me give her some oats.” “Helena …” Papa started. “I don’t know, Helena,” Francois said. “It’s still a little fired up.” “I can do it. I’ll be careful.” After a silent moment, Papa nodded to Francois. “All right, if you walk up with her.” Francois led me to the feed bag hanging outside the stable. He dug out a handful of oats and emptied some into my hand. “Now you let me go first,” he said. We stepped toward the colt, slow and steady. It watched our every move, looking curious, as I hobbled forward with a smile. Francois opened his hand and extended it beneath the colt’s mouth. The colt snorted and tossed its head. Then it bent, sniffed, and nibbled like one of Papa’s sheep. “See, she’s sweet,” I said. I lifted my open palm with my oats, careful not to startle the colt. It stared at me for several seconds. Then it nibbled from my hand. It tickled. When all the oats were gone, it buried his nose in my hand and nuzzled. I took a step closer, moving slow and gentle. It gave a low snort from somewhere in its belly, as a warning. I smiled and took another small step. It let me edge closer. Then I gently curved my hand around to stroke its jaw, and it relaxed. It took a half-step closer and bent its head to let me pet it. I laid my head against the colt and hugged it with both arms. “She likes me.” “Would you look at that?” Francois said, sounding surprised. “But ‘she’ is a ‘he’.” 28 “How do you know?” “Just trust me, all right? So. Now you’ve got him settled, what do you think we should name him?” My eyes lit up. “Crimson. His whole flank is crimson like fire.” It was my favorite word for red. Papa’s face wrinkled at that as he held my burlap cloak. Though he looked more pained than offended. “Then ‘Crimson’ it is,” Francois said, petting the colt as he grew calmer. “And you can help me take care of him.” I looked up at him. “I can? You mean it?” “You come out as often as you like, Helena. When you’re older, I’ll teach you to ride him.” My heart raced. Women rode in carriages, not on horses, and I had never heard of a girl learning how to ride. I leaned against him and threw my arms around his belly, squeezing him tight. “Thank you. Thank you, Francois.” He turned toward Papa, licking his lips. “If it’s all right with your father, that is.” I looked back. “Can I, Papa?” Papa looked pale. He wrung the burlap cloak in his hands. “We’ll see. When you’re a little older.” I hobbled to Papa and fell onto him in a tight hug. I limped back to Crimson, who continued to study my awkward movements, and petted him again. He leaned his head down and 29 stared at me as though we could see into one another’s souls. 30 4. Crimson lifted his head and snorted. I released him as another horse whinnied in the distance. I hobbled toward Papa to peer around the corner of Francois’ stable. A beautiful black coach was rolling across the muddy path to the cabin. Papa’s voice rose. “Were you expecting Duke Laurent?” Francois arrived behind us. “Last person I’d be expecting out here. ‘Course, I didn’t expect to see you today, either.” 31 Duke Laurent ruled the province, but he and Papa had become good friends. He always gave me the most delicious apples and pears whenever he visited Papa. He made me feel almost as safe as Francois. As the adorned coach drew closer, I spotted a gray Palomino trotting behind it amidst the falling leaves. I smiled, recognizing the black cloak and hat of its rider. “Or Father Vestille?” Papa asked. Francois craned his neck forward and gaped. “Next to last person I’d expect. Unless he’s short on confessions. I’m sure I could fill his plate, if he’s feeling lonely.” Papa lowered his chin. “Show respect, Francois.” Francois raised his hands. “Sorry.” Father Vestille didn’t always make me feel safe, but he always smiled and bent down to listen to me after the Sunday Mass. When I was little, he let me sit on his lap whenever he came to visit us. Every time I talked with him, I completely forgot about my scars. The royal coach arrived first. I watched closely as the driver stepped down from his perch to open the rear door. I always felt proud knowing Papa was friends with the Duke of La Rue Sauvage himself. Duke Laurent jumped down and nodded his thanks to the driver, then gaped at us with wide eyes. He ran to Papa, ignoring the mud that splattered on the fine wool-lined coat Mama had made for him. “Henri, are you both all right? I 32 heard there was some trouble in the village. Doctor Renoire said you went home, but we saw the tracks leading here.” Papa shook his hand. “She’s all right. Doctor Renoire said she just needs to rest.” Duke Laurent regarded me with pitiful golden-brown eyes, which made him look even more handsome. He knelt before me, kissing both my hands as if I was a princess. “Helena. I’m so glad you’re all right.” “I am. It still hurts, though.” “I’m sure it does. But you’ll get well. Just rest, like your father says, and you’ll be up and about in no time.” “Monsieur,” Papa said. “May I introduce Francois Revelier?” The Duke stood as Papa and Francois bowed their heads. “The man who saved Helena last year?” He took a step back to view Francois’ full height and size. “Such bravery should not go unnoticed. If I were back at the court in Versailles, you would receive a medal for protecting one of our precious citizens. I can’t provide that, but I believe a banquet in your honor is long overdue.” My heart leaped as Francois gaped at him. “Well, uh – thank you. Your Majesty. Er, Your Grace.” The Duke smiled. “You may call me ‘Monsieur’. Or ‘Leopold’, if you prefer.” Francois shook his hand. “Think it’ll have to be ‘Monsieur’. Wouldn’t feel right using the first name of royalty.” 33 “I’m not all that royal anymore,” Duke Laurent joked. “Any news from the King?” Papa asked. The Duke’s face fell. He glanced down at me, then back at Papa, spreading his hands. “He still refuses to answer my letters. I’ve tried, Henri. I can implore him to send some men, but – .” “I know,” Papa said. “You have no authority with Versailles.” Duke Laurent shrugged and shook his head. “The perils of losing favor with the royal court. I’m fortunate to be given oversight here. I only wish I could provide better security for --.” He glanced down at me and stopped himself. “… for our province.” Papa heaved a sigh. “We need soldiers, Monsieur Laurent. There must be someone we can appeal to. Someone to make the King see reason.” “I’m afraid the only one who can change the mind of the King toward me and our province is the King. I’ve asked. I’ve pleaded. I’ve begged.” His eyes burrowed into the ground. “I don’t even know whether they open my appeals or if they immediately discard them upon seeing my name.” Papa whirled away with clenched fists. He unclenched them quickly as Father Vestille strode toward us, the sun glinting off of his bald head. “Abier, how are you?” Papa said, shaking hands. “You know Francois, of course.” Father Vestille nodded to Francois. “Of course.” Francois smiled, with less than his usual warmth. “Well, we’re not on a first name basis.” 34 “Perhaps we should be,” Father Vestille said. “I haven’t even spoken to you since --. Well, since Spring.” He glanced at me the same way Duke Laurent had. As if I didn’t remember what Francois did for me this past spring. He knelt before me with open arms. I hugged him tight. “What are you doing here?” “I heard there was a commotion in the village. I came to see you.” He lowered his chin, his forehead creasing with worry. “Are you all right?” I nodded, feeling better. Safer, even. “I saw you weren’t at home, so I followed the tracks here. I told Celeste I would find you both. I, ah –.” He raised his eyebrows at Papa. “I didn’t tell her anything else. Figured you’d want to share that.” Papa nodded. “Thank you.” “Did you hear what happened?” I asked. “Doctor Renoire found me and told me about it. I’ll have a talk with Andre Denue tomorrow, see if I can find out who the other boys were,” he said, more to Papa than to me. “Are you going to excommunicate Monsieur Denue?” I asked, hopeful. “Or Jacque?” Father Vestille blinked. “I don’t think I’ll need to do that, Helena. I would rather give them both a chance to make amends.” “But they beat me. And they wouldn’t stop. You have to do something.” 35 “I will. I plan to talk to every one of them about what they’ve done. And help them understand the wrong of it.” I shook my head. “That won’t help. You need to punish them, to make sure they can’t do it again. You have to hurt them the way they hurt me. You should –!” “Helena,” Papa interrupted with a scowl. “That’s enough.” “Yes, leave the punishments to me, Helena,” Duke Laurent broke in. “After all, maintaining order is the role of government. Not the church.” Father Vestille looked sideways at the Duke and frowned. “Yes, that is true. Tell me, what is being done about these occasional – attacks?” “All that the King will allow, which isn’t much, I’m afraid. As far as France is concerned, we’re on our own.” Father Vestille wrinkled his brow. “So the King plans to let La Rue Sauvage fend for itself? He refuses to lift a finger to help us?” “Your words, not mine, Father,” Duke Laurent replied. Father Vestille stepped toward him, looking annoyed, as Papa moved between them. I fidgeted, eager to avoid their argument. “I want to see Crimson again,” I told Francois. “Sure thing,” Francois boomed. “Right this way. We’ll let these gentlemen continue their civil conversation on their own.” He cast an amused 36 glance over his shoulder, and I saw Papa sour at him as we trudged to the rear of the stable. Crimson stood by the gate and lifted his head as we returned, still focused on me. I limped back to the feed bag to give him some more oats. “It’s all right, Crimson. Just Papa talking with Duke Laurent and Father Vestille. Nothing to be afraid of.” I watched the oats disappear from my hand as he nibbled. My sides still ached, but I felt numb inside. Numb and helpless, with no one to protect me from Jacque Denue and his friends. Or from anything else. “Francois? How often do you get scared?” “I dunno. Now and then. Everybody gets scared sometimes.” I stroked Crimson’s flank. “I feel like I’m scared all the time.” He didn’t answer right away. “What’re you scared of?” “That the wolf might come back.” He shuffled his feet in the grass. “Hard to come back if he’s dead.” I pictured its horrible image again. Its monstrous head. Its jagged ears. Its fanged smile. “I heard there were other attacks. Didn’t the wolf kill some other people, too?” Francois paced to one side, then back toward me. “That was before. Figure it was that same wolf. Sure, there have been other attacks, by wolves or some other animals. But you don’t need to worry about that big, bad wolf anymore. He’s gone forever.” 37 “Were you scared when you killed him?” “‘Course I was. But sometimes there are things more important than being scared. Things you’ve got to stand up and fight for.” “Like trying to save Grand’Mere?” “Yeah. And looking after you. I mean, if I hadn’t gone in after that wolf – well, he would’ve gotten you, too. Can’t let being scared stop you from doing what’s right. If everybody stays scared, who’s gonna protect us?” I knew he was right. But the wolf was monstrous. And I was just a girl that older boys beat on. “Francois. Can you teach me to fight?” His eyes bulged. “Uhhh, now why would you want to learn that, Helena?” I cocked my head at him. “You know why. So I can beat up Jacque Denue instead of him beating on me.” He frowned. “I’m not sure that’s the answer to your problem, Helena. Certainly not the answer your father would give you.” “That’s why I’m asking you. You know how to stand up and fight. You knew how to kill that wolf.” He scratched his beard. “Yeah, well. Funny thing, that whole business. I didn’t strike it that hard, you know? I just got lucky. That big old wolf must have been tired or sick or something, because I barely grazed it. It died a few seconds after I struck it.” I blinked. “I thought you chopped its head off.” 38 “That was after he died. Didn’t want to take any chances with a wolf that big. But – well, anyway. Fighting’s not the answer. Not for a young girl like you.” “So I just have to get beat up?” He pressed his lips tight, then sighed heavily at the ground. He crouched beside me, his voice dropping to a low whisper. “All right, come here. Look. The thing about any fight is, not so much getting in your licks at the other guy, as making sure he doesn’t get anything on you.” I squinted. “Huh?” “I mean, don’t tire yourself out. If he swings at you with his right, you step aside and let him miss. When he swings again, you step back or to the side again. Sooner or later, he’ll tire himself out trying to hit you.” “And then you flatten him,” I said, excited. He half-smiled. “Well, yeah. But the same thing. Don’t tire yourself out. Look, you’re a girl. Boys are gonna be stronger than you most of the time, right? So don’t just use your fists.” He leaned toward the corner of the stable and listened to make sure the others were still talking. Then he crouched and spoke even softer. “Grab a stick. Or a brick. Or a rock. Or anything you can use to lay him flat.” My stomach churned at the thought of a brick smashing into Jacque Denue’s face. “I don’t want to kill him.” “Then don’t hit him where you’ll kill him. Just hit him hard enough in the knee or the gut that he won’t think of bothering you again. All right?” 39 I nodded, satisfied. “All right.” “And, uh – .” He glanced back to the side again. “Don’t tell your father we had this talk. Think it’s better that way.” I smiled. “Me, too.” He nodded, pressing his hands on his knees to rise. Then he bent back down. “Listen, Helena. If you ever run into trouble – real trouble – and I’m not around, I want you to look up a friend of mine in the village. Name’s Gerard Touraine. He’ll look after you.” I nodded. “Gerard Touraine. All right.” He glanced back at the corner of the stable. We heard Papa still talking with the others. “All right, let me show you how to look after yourself.” He stood a little, his hands on his knees as he bent over me. He made a fist. “If someone comes at you like this, see, you step sideways out of the way. That’s it. Hey, even hobbling around, it’s easier to move without a dress, ain’t it? Now while he’s swinging hard and hitting air, he’s off-balance. See that? See how I’m ready to fall forward? So you knuckle both your fists together and swing hard on his back to carry him the rest of the way. He’ll plant his face in the mud. Or he’ll double over and you can bring your knee up hard to his jaw. Got me? But you gotta know how to keep from getting hit first, so you can use his own strength against him. Then you just knock him over or punch him in his ribs, hard. That’ll take the wind out of him. Strike hard and fast. The faster you finish it, the less likely he’ll be to mess with you again.” He glanced up as Papa returned, and straightened to 40 his full height. “– and that’s why you should never fight with boys. That’s what I say. So just stay away from those bullies.” He gave a firm nod. Papa smiled at him. “Duke Laurent and Father Vestille have gone home, now that they know you’re safe. Don’t think they see eye-to-eye on many subjects. Helena, it’ll be dark in a few hours. Are you ready to go home?” I smiled at Francois, feeling a new sense of confidence. “Yes. I’m ready.” Francois Revelier had taught me how to fight. I had new hope. 41 5. It was near dark when we pulled up to our cottage. Only a couple of the sheep lay awake bleating in their pen while the rest slept. Papa had driven Royale faster up the path when the air chilled and the sun dipped toward the horizon. The mud had dried, making the ride faster if not smoother. Mama strode onto the front porch to greet us, her hands twisting around a cloth towel as if it needed to be wrung. She looked pale and her eyes 42 were larger than usual. “Henri. You’re so late. What on earth happened?” “Everything’s all right, Celeste,” he promised. “Had an incident in town. Then we went to see Francois.” She squinted through the darkness to see me. To see my face. Her eyes bulged. “Dear –! Come inside. What happened? Did something –? … Come in here and let me clean you up. Henri, tell me what happened.” I hobbled over the hard ground to Mama. She held me against her as we moved indoors. She led me straight through the front kitchen and off to my room at the back of the house, then helped me lay down on my bed. It felt good to finally rest. Though I dreaded sleep, especially after today. She unlaced my shoes, caked with dry mud, and pulled them off as Papa came in. “Some boys in the village beat her. I took her to Doctor Renoire. He loaned us his son’s clothes for a while, ‘til next time we return to the village.” “Well, you’ll go alone next time. She’s not going back to that village.” Her voice and face grew tight. “I know. Never should’ve agreed to take her in the first place.” “Yes, you should,” I said. “I can’t stay inside forever, Papa. Sooner or later, I’ve got to stand up.” “Hush now,” Mama said, stroking my forehead. “Henri, get a basin of water.” 43 Papa left without a word. “I have to stand up, Mama,” I repeated. “You need to lie down.” “No. I have to stand up to them. I have to fight.” “Hush. Just keep far away from those boys.” I stared at her, marveling at her perfect appearance and poise. Her auburn hair up in a beautiful bun with ringlets dangling about her ears. Her homespun dress – she was an amazing seamstress – rising from her shoulders in shapely curves, its intricate pattern decorating her slim arms and wrists. Her face peaceful and soft, even when flushed with anger. “Mama? Am I a monster?” Her eyes flared. “What on earth would make you think that?” “That’s what those boys said. That’s why they beat me. Because I’m so ugly.” She gaped at me as if I had burned down our cottage. “If that’s why they beat you, it’s those boys who are ugly monsters.” A tear slid around my cheek as I admired her features. “I wish I were pretty like you.” She nearly lunged at me, scooping me into her tight embrace. Papa hurried in with the water basin, but slowed and set it down gently when he saw us hugging. “Helena, you are pretty,” Mama said. “Not to boys, I’m not.” “You don’t need to worry about boys just now. You’re a beautiful girl. And you have a 44 beautiful heart. Someday, when you’re much older, you’ll meet a boy who sees that.” Papa glanced sharply at us. Then he focused on soaking a rag in the water. He didn’t like for me to talk about boys at all, even with Mama. “The boys in town think I’m a monster. Except for Pierre.” Mama trembled against me. “Well, he’s a nice boy, at least. You can forget about the others. Now let’s get you cleaned up.” Papa slid the basin closer and Mama helped me remove the boy’s tunic and trousers. She cleaned every bruise and cut, put fresh bandages over a few of them, then dried me off and helped me dress in my nightgown. “Say your prayers,” she said. I knelt carefully beside my bed as they stood watch. My back and side and one knee still ached horribly. I made the sign of the cross over myself and folded my blistered hands. “Dear Lord, please bless and secure our home. Protect us and lead us. Bless our province. Bless Francois and Father Vestille and Duke Laurent, and help the King see that we need help. Heal me and help me sleep through the night. Amen.” I rose slowly, pulled back the covers and climbed into bed. Papa hung his head and tightened his fists as Mama kissed my forehead. “I love you, Helena,” she said, her voice strained. “Sweet dreams.” They stepped out and shut the door, encasing me in blackness. 45 Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares. I wandered through the flowery meadow outside our home and on into the dark canopy of the woods. My little basket swung at my side. I smiled at the red hooded cloak surrounding me, the one Grand’Mere had made, warding off the early morning chill. My cheeks were rosy and free of scars. I listened close in the darkness of the pine trees, shuddering. Within the whistling wind, I could hear its voice. Where are you going, little girl? I started to run. Through the woods, past shrubs and towering trees and scurrying animals. The forest grew denser, until I felt it might close in on me. I scoured every direction for the source of the growling voice but saw nothing. So nice to see you again, little girl. My heart pounded. I ran faster. I stumbled, but rose to my feet and raced on. The voice grew louder. I can see you, little Helena. I’m coming after you … I emerged from the woods, from the heavy strangle of trees, into the broad meadow outside Grand’Mere Marie’s cottage. I had to warn her. I ran to her door and pounded on it, stealing glances over my shoulder. The woods remained still and quiet, but the voice persisted from somewhere. Helena. I’m coming for you … 46 I heard snoring. At the neighboring cottage, the window shutter hung open. I could see Francois’ large frame, asleep on his cot, his giant belly rising and falling. Ah, there you are, Helena. I spun around. In a stream of fog at the edge of the dark forest, the black wolf stood tall, its blue-gray eyes shining brightly. I twisted the doorknob and ran inside. I slammed the door shut with both hands, then swung the bolt down to lock it. I turned to find Grand’Mere. There on her bed, something shuffled in the sheets. The black wolf had already gotten inside somehow, circling among Grand’Mere’s nightgown and cap, now soaked in blood. I gasped and fell against the door. The beast fixed its ghostly eyes on me. Its voice rasped low and cruel. “Come in, little girl. Come see your Grand’Mere.” The same wolf that had padded close to me in the woods, keeping its distance but calling out until I answered. Until I told it I was going to my Grand’Mere’s house, and to leave me alone. Instead, it had raced ahead to devour her. The wolf jumped down from the bloody bed and padded across the cherrywood floor toward me. It stood – stood – on its hind legs, grinning. I hurled my basket at its face. It scraped the beast’s nose and bounced off. The wolf arched its eyebrows, its blue-gray eyes widening. It lifted its paw, extending sharp claws, then swiped at me as I screamed. 47 Everything fell black. My skin felt clammy, my nightgown drenched with sweat. I sat straight up in bed, feeling the soreness in my back as I stared into the pitch darkness. Something stomped hard across the floorboards. Then a faint light peeked beneath my door. Mama came in. Papa followed her, bearing a lantern. Mama rushed to my side and cradled me. “Helena, you’re all right. It’s just a bad dream.” I clung to her, feeling numb. I stared at Papa’s lantern, the only source of light. “It spoke again,” I said. “Hush, Helena,” she told me. “It was just a bad dream. Wolves can’t speak.” I let her rock me back and forth, back and forth. They never believed me, any more than Father Vestille or Francois had when they brought me to Doctor Renoire. They assumed I was hysterical and babbling in my delirium. I closed my eyes to shut out the nightmare. But my mind saw the wolf’s leering grin. Heard its guttural voice. “Where’s my cloak?” I asked. They said nothing. I opened my eyes. Papa straightened, his posture rigid. “It’s put away.” “Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. It’s mine.” In the pale light of his high lantern, Papa’s dark moustache formed a thick frown. “Your burlap cloak will keep you warm enough. And it won’t attract attention.” 48 A wolf howled in the distance. My body tensed in a spasm as Mama tightened her hold. Papa rushed to the shuttered window. He stood there, his back to me. For a moment, I thought he would throw open the shutter, to see if the wolf was lurking right outside. I expected him to leap through the window in one bound, race into the forest, find the wolf, and strangle it with his bare hands. He only stood there, listening. The wolf’s howls rose, rattling my nerves as though it lived inside me. Papa stared at the closed shutter. “You can sleep in our bed again tonight,” he said. 49 6. The sun broke through the clouds to shine down on our lost sheep. Drawn to the blooming purple flowers, it had wandered down the slope, near the cliff’s edge. “There she is!” Papa tugged on Royale’s reins as he held up a hand to the rest of us. Our border collie, Valiant, barked beneath him. Pierre pulled his horse, Diamond, to a jarring halt. His arm snaked around my back to keep me from falling off, pressing me closer against him. His father, Monsieur Leóne, followed 50 suit and stopped Ruby, who shifted awkwardly beneath his weight. The four of us paused at the crest of the hill, at the edge of the forest. I clung to Pierre’s warm back, the best protection against the biting cold. The broad grassland below was bathed in sunshine, lush and green and deadly. We saw where our sheep had broken through some taller grass and nibbled its way near the cliff. Beyond its rim, the distant mountains stood guard in a hazy mist. I could barely make out the well-girded wooden bridge that connected them, as it disappeared in the fog halfway across. “Careful now,” Papa said. “Don’t scare it.” He started down first, leading Royale step by step, careful not to stumble. Valiant padded obediently beside him. I peered around Pierre at a huge hole in the ground, that looked as though some giant had taken a bite out of the hill. I hoped Papa and Valiant wouldn’t fall into it. I pressed myself closer, giving Pierre a gentle hug. “Thank you for holding on to me,” I said. “No problem, Red,” he whispered back. I smiled. “You know I can’t wear my cloak anymore, Pierre.” I didn’t count the burlap shawl as a cloak, as I pulled it closer about my shoulders. I had just turned eight years old, but I still wasn’t allowed to wear anything too bright outside. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll always be ‘Red’ to me.” Pierre was the only one who still called me ‘Red’. I had worn that scarlet hooded cloak 51 everywhere, even indoors, for two straight years. I had swept into every room, beaming as the cape fanned out behind me. Wrapped inside it, I always felt as if nothing could harm me. No degree of cold, no sad news, no fears. I felt the same way whenever Pierre called me ‘Red’. Papa and Valiant drew closer and closer to the sheep. It seemed to take forever. I wanted to jump down from Diamond’s back, rush down the hill and scoop it up myself. But, as Papa often reminded me, I needed to learn patience. My foot shook back and forth against Diamond’s flank with anticipation. Diamond whinnied, annoyed. “Helena, stop!” Pierre whispered. “Sorry.” The sheep jerked its head up at the sound. Papa stopped Royale and waited, neither he nor Valiant moving. The sheep finally returned to its grazing. Papa turned slowly to look up the hill at us. I swallowed, feeling my cheeks burn. He continued down, one hoof at a time, as the sheep nibbled at the grassy slope. I stared again at the giant hole. “What’s that?” I whispered. Pierre leaned back to my ear. “Probably left over from the war, when everyone started invading. People had to find all sorts of places to hide away. This must be one somebody dug out.” I pressed against his back, pulling him tight. “Mama told me we had to hide when I was a baby. She wouldn’t tell me anything else about it, though. But I remember looking up and seeing a wide door open above me. There was a big ramp 52 with steps leading out into the sun. I think I was only three years old.” Diamond shuffled his feet and whinnied again. Papa turned sharply and looked right at me. I shrank back behind Pierre. Papa continued down the slope and pulled Royale to a stop, about fifteen feet from the sheep. He clicked his tongue at Valiant, who moved around the animal to stand between it and the cliff’s edge. He barked and the sheep jolted upright, bleating. Valiant barked louder, moving toward it. The sheep shuffled toward Papa, who led Royale behind the sheep to guide it up the hill. We would have no trouble leading it home now. “Come on down,” he called to us. “Let’s take a rest.” He climbed down and took some jerky from his saddle pouch. We descended slowly with Monsieur Leóne and the horses. “What’s that bridge near the mountains?” I asked. “Leads out of the province,” Pierre said. “Across the gorge, then through the mountains. Eventually, if you keep going, you get to the royal palace in Versailles.” “That would be exciting, to see the palace.” Pierre shrugged. “I hear the King’s corrupt.” “Who says that?” “My father. He says the King won’t talk to Duke Laurent at all. We get no support from the court. The Duke keeps asking them to send soldiers here, but the King won’t even answer his letters.” 53 “I heard Papa talking about that with the Duke in the Fall, when he told Francois about the banquet. I wish you could come. We’ve been waiting for it all winter.” He shrugged again. “Only rich people there, besides you and your parents. Heard they invited a couple of people Francois knows, but it’s mostly the Duke’s friends. Think he’s trying to impress everyone with a show.” “You think so?” I asked, concerned. “It’s what royal people do. They don’t necessarily do anything to help, just make it look like they’re doing something. I think the party’s more for the Duke to look good than to honor Francois.” I considered that, then waved it off. “That may be. But the Duke’s not like other royal people.” “True,” Pierre said. “If everyone at the court were like him, we’d probably have those soldiers by now.” “Why do we need soldiers?” He stopped Diamond and turned in his seat, narrowing his eyes at me. They were brown and beautiful beneath his shaggy dirt-blond hair. He could have told me anything right then and I would have sat on his horse and listened for hours. “Because of the wolf,” he said. A lump gathered in my throat. Riding with Pierre through the mountains and rolling hills after being penned up at our cottage these last two months, I had forgotten about the wolf today. “Oh,” I said. 54 “You and your Grand’Mere weren’t the only ones attacked, Red. Other people have been killed over the years. And people are still being killed. But no one’s seen this other wolf in time to stop it. We need soldiers to find it and kill it, so it’ll be safe again.” Safe again. The idea sounded so strange to me. I couldn’t imagine any number of soldiers making me feel safe in La Rue Sauvage. “Do you miss your mother?” I asked. I wanted to change the subject. It was easier to talk about Pierre’s grief than my own. He swiped at his thick hair, showing his forehead for an instant. “Sure. ‘Course I do.” He bit his lip. “But we’ve been pretty busy. Papa’s teaching me all there is to know about smelting and making tools and pots. He tells me I’ve got the skill for it, as much as he did when he was my age. Thinks I’ll make a great blacksmith some day.” Diamond shifted to one side as Pierre maneuvered him past some holes in the side of the hill. I leaned forward and clung tighter to Pierre. “I think so, too,” I told him. “Easy there,” Monsieur Leóne called to both of us, his belly shifting from side to side as he led Ruby down the foothill. “It’s steep. Don’t want to tumble off the edge.” “Yes, Papa,” Pierre said. Below him, Papa stood chewing his jerky. “Everyone all right? Frayne, thanks for spotting her.” Valiant barked as if in agreement. Papa gave him a biscuit from his pouch. 55 “Thought it looked like yours,” Monsieur Leóne said, struggling to climb down. “Next moment, it was gone. Can’t believe it wandered this far so quickly.” He swiped at thin strands of hair falling over his face, the same way Pierre often did. “Just glad I could do something to help.” Papa squatted and brushed some brambles off the sheep’s wool. “Looks like it fell down a hill or two. Good thing it found plenty of grass to nibble on here, before it rolled into the ravine. Sit down. We’ll head back in a minute.” We sat in the grass, chewing on jerky and biscuits and enjoying the fresh air and billowing clouds. I spotted a distant path around the left side of the mountain, far ahead. I stood and walked toward it as Valiant scampered after me, yapping. Papa stood and almost choked on his biscuit. “Helena! Come back from the cliff!” “I’m not near the edge. Look, there’s a road down here.” Someone had built a path around the side of the mountain. It sloped down and gradually worked its way back up to join the broad dirt path leading to the bridge and out of the province. “I said, come back,” Papa repeated. I stuck my fists on my hips. “Papa, I can take care of myself. Don’t you remember I’m eight now?” “You’ve been eight for a week,” he said. He finished chewing and climbed back onto Royale. “And we’ve stayed long enough already. Let’s head home before it gets dark.” 56 My heart sank. I knelt to scratch Valiant behind the ears. “Papa, it’s a beautiful day. Can’t we ride a little farther?” “I let you come along because you wanted to help and you wanted to see Pierre, and I figured it’s just as well to know where you are. We’ve had a nice rest, but it’s time to get back home. Come along.” He nudged Royale’s flanks and started a quick trot up the hill. Monsieur Leóne followed suit with Ruby. “Sorry, Red,” Pierre said. “It’s so pretty here.” I stared out at the endless mountain range beyond the bridge, shrouded in fog and mystery. I didn’t mind the moist chill on my shoulders, if it meant being free to roam outside, beyond our meadow, even for a little while. I found myself staring through the haze at the bridge leading out of La Rue Sauvage. It lay just beyond the wide green plateau that stretched away on both sides and ended in two points, resembling a large sleeping crocodile. Pierre mounted Diamond and bent to offer his hand. I took it and climbed up behind him. We turned slowly from the inviting scene. Pierre took his time leaving, knowing how much I wanted to stay. He was giving me every second he could. “Come on, Pierre,” Papa called from the crest of the hill. “I thought you said that horse was fast.” There was humor in his voice. I couldn’t remember the last time he sounded happy. “The fastest,” Pierre called back. “Well, prove it! We need to get the sheep settled so we can make it to the banquet.” 57 “Hey, look at that,” Pierre said, inspired. “What?” “There’s a hole down on this end, too.” I looked where he was pointing as Valiant started barking and growling at it. Behind a boulder at our far right, close to the edge, another enormous hole had been dug through the side of the hill, nearly big enough to fit a wagon. “It’s a tunnel.” “Yeah. Leading straight up to the top.” I smiled. “You’re so smart, Pierre.” “Hang on.” He spurred Diamond toward the hole. Diamond snorted and kicked up dirt as Valiant barked and chased after us. I clung tighter to Pierre while Papa and Monsieur Leóne gaped, before breaking into a gallop after us. It must have looked like we were headed over the cliff. Valiant stopped short near the dark passage and fell back, to race up the hill instead. We curved around the boulder and Papa’s frantic image vanished as we descended into the tunnel’s black mouth. The swallowing darkness and cold frightened me for a moment, but I pressed close against Pierre. My eyes adjusted quickly, as light bled in from the other end of the tunnel and from small holes dug into the earth above us. They would be invisible on the surface, but here below they gave extra light and air. Pierre was right about men hollowing out this tunnel for refuge during the war. Diamond’s hooves clomped over several logs that had been buried in the ground to create a partial stairway. 58 Something stirred in the darkness up ahead. A large animal had hunched over something in the center of the tunnel and now raised its head, its eyes flashing on us. Its blue-gray eyes. The wolf growled from somewhere deep in its belly as we rushed past it, its breath forming a white shroud. “Hurry!” I cried. Pierre leaned forward in the saddle, urging Diamond up the dark slope. Behind us, the black wolf watched us go. I heard his mouth smacking on something he was eating. Something he must have dragged down here to finish off. Then he started after us. “Go, Pierre! Faster!” Pierre pushed Diamond harder and we lunged forward. The enormous wolf loped after us in greater strides. It would sink its teeth into us in seconds. “GO!” Light filled the end of the tunnel as it formed a steeper angle, where extra logs had been laid. I felt a touch of the sun’s warmth as we neared the opening. The wolf slowed and skidded to a halt, letting us flee. We burst out of the upper end, my heart pounding as I gasped for breath. “Helena!” Papa thundered, his angry voice bringing a strange sense of calm. “What did you think you were doing?’ Valiant barked and growled at the hole behind us. 59 Monsieur Leóne trotted up to us, his eyes wide beneath his wild, unkempt hair. “Do you realize what might have happened? Who knows what might be in there?” I had never seen him so agitated. Pierre was flustered. “Papa, there was something! There was – !” “Let’s go home!” I interrupted. “We’re really sorry, Papa. Monsieur Leóne. We won’t do it again. Let’s just – Let’s just hurry home so we can get to the banquet.” “But –!” Pierre burst. “Pierre, we made a mistake. We shouldn’t have gone in there. Let’s just go home, all right? Let’s just go home.” He breathed deeply in and out, staring at me in fright. “Helena. What happened?” Papa asked. “We – We almost tripped. On a tree root. Almost fell over. We got scared. That’s all. Let’s all just hurry home and forget about it, all right? Please?” Pierre looked from me to Papa and Monsieur Leóne. He slowed his frantic breathing as Valiant watched the tunnel with a murmuring growl. He stared at me again, then back at the quiet hole. “All right. Let’s forget about it. For now.” “Just don’t try anything so foolish again,” Papa said. “You might both have been killed.” Pierre led Diamond away. I squinted over my shoulder. From deep within the darkness, the blue-gray eyes shone as if studying our every move. 60 7. Papa pulled our wagon up to the front of the tavern. The sign above its hitching post said La Maison de Touraine. We sat for a moment, listening to the raucous men laughing and shouting inside as Papa regarded Mama. She sat rigid, drawing her shawl closer against the evening air, her chin angled up. “I simply can’t understand why it had to be here, of all places. After we waited all winter for the Duke to arrange this. I thought we were supposed to be 61 honoring someone. What’s honorable about surrounding ourselves with a lot of drinking?” They had been silent for most of the ride. At first I thought Papa was still angry at me for riding through the tunnel with Pierre. Then I remembered how Mama felt about alcohol and the place Duke Laurent chose for Francois’ banquet. Besides, I had already promised Papa I would never do it again. And I meant it. I still pictured those blue-gray eyes, shining as they had chased me and Pierre. As they had watched us leave the grassy cliff. Entering that tunnel again would be like jumping into the wolf’s mouth. The tavern’s double doors flew open with a bang and I yelped as two men burst from inside. Their boots clomped across the porch beside the hitching post as they guffawed, one slapping the other on the back. I sighed, quivering. Mama put an arm around me, tugging me close. She frowned at Papa. “Helena doesn’t need to be around men like these. Especially after all that’s happened.” Papa studied me, weighing his decision. “It’s for Francois,” he said. “We won’t stay long.” Mama gave me another strong squeeze, then waited for Papa to hitch up Royale and help her down. He brought me down next. He never swung me in the air anymore, the way Francois did, though I was light enough and my wounds had all mended. Instead, he set me down like I was a porcelain doll. 62 Mama put her hand on my shoulder and we pushed through the large oak double doors. Inside, men roared with laughter and deafening shouts. Some waved their fists in the air as they spoke. I backed into Mama, then clutched her hand with both of mine. This place looked like it could get out of control within seconds. Duke Laurent spotted us from across the room. He strode toward us with open arms, which gave me some assurance. No one could harm us with the Duke standing close by. “Henri! Celeste! So good to see you!” He shook Papa’s hand and kissed Mama’s, then smiled at me. “And how are you today, Helena?” “A bit nervous,” Mama answered for me. “I’m afraid this isn’t the most suitable environment for an eight-year old girl.” Papa put a hand on Mama’s shoulder, too late to quiet her. The Duke’s face fell. “I am so sorry,” he said. “I know Francois frequents this place and I know some men who come here. I thought it would be ideal to recognize his actions. I’m afraid I failed to consider what a difficult position it would put you in.” He gave a little laugh. “Perhaps that is why the royal family places so little faith in me.” “It’s all right, Your Grace,” Papa said. “We’re sure you planned this out as best you could.” Mama’s face softened as she met my eyes. I held her hand more loosely now, feeling safer 63 with the Duke standing between us and the crowd. “Yes, we’re here for Francois, after all,” she said. The Duke kissed Mama’s hand again, bowing lower. “The grace of a Queen. Henri is fortunate to have you, and I’m fortunate to have your forgiveness. Now, please, come in and we’ll find Francois. Ah, Simonet! You have not met Henri’s family. Madame Basque, may I present my chief advisor, Siegfried Simonet. Monsieur Simonet, this is Henri’s wife, Madame Celeste Basque, and their daughter, Helena Basque.” The Duke’s advisor loomed over me, tall, thin and frowning, with stringy black hair that rode down his back like the Duke’s. He regarded me with lazy eyes and gave a disinterested nod. I resisted the urge to flinch. Thankfully, Monsieur Simonet turned from me to shake hands with Papa and nod at Mama. He seemed just as unconcerned with them, and quickly turned to Duke Laurent. “How many more guests do you anticipate?” he asked. “Our guest of honor wants to make certain you are providing enough wine and ale.” The Duke laughed. He turned to spread his arms wide as Francois came thundering toward him. “For our hero, all the wine and ale he wants!” “That’sss what I like to hearrr!” Francois said, stumbling a little as he approached. ‘Most grateful for your hossspitality, Your Highnesss.” I prepared to run toward him, to let him swing me through the air. But Mama’s hand pressed on my shoulder and held me back. 64 Papa stepped forward. “Francois. Good to see you.” “Heyyy,” Francois said, blinking at Papa as if he didn’t recognize him. “Henri. And Celeste.” He turned to me and crouched, pressing his hands over his knees. One fist held a dark half-empty bottle. “And there’s little Helena. How’rrre you, little Mademoissselle?” “Fine,” I said. “Are you all right, Francois?” He waved me off and stood, like an old woman trying to rise from her rocking chair. “‘Courssse. ‘Course I am. Just enjoying this wonderful party the Duke’s giving me, that’s all. After your birthday, it’s jussst been onne party after anothhher.” The Duke winked at me. “He’s fine, Helena.” He smiled at Simonet. “I don’t suppose you’ll indulge yourself with any wine tonight, Simonet?” Simonet maintained his frown. “I prefer to keep myself alert.” Duke Laurent leaned toward Papa. “Simonet is extremely self-disciplined. He’s the closest thing I have to a priest.” I looked about, hopeful to see our actual priest. “Is Father Vestille here?” “I invited him,” Duke Laurent said. “But he declined.” Francois barked out a laugh. “He’s afraid of the beer!” Papa leaned close to the Duke as Francois continued to laugh louder. “He’s visiting one of the 65 other provinces. Dijon. There’s a large church there –.” “Ah, of course,” the Duke said. “Can’t expect him to remain satisfied with a tiny province like La Rue Sauvage forever. I wish him success.” Papa knit his brow. “He’s not seeking a better position. Just visiting.” “Oh, he has friends there?” “Yes. Well – friends he’s made there. On previous visits.” “Ah. I see,” the Duke said, smiling. I looked from one face to the other, trying to understand. “What are you saying, Monsieur Laurent?” “Nothing at all, Helena. For any man, even a priest, there comes a time to think about the future. I came here from Versailles myself and I’m quite proud of our accomplishments. But I wouldn’t blame anyone for seeking opportunity in a larger province. Somewhere more comfortable or safe. A man like Father Vestille could become very influential if he found the right church.” I felt as if he had ripped my heart out and left a gaping hole in my chest. “You think he wants to leave?” He shrugged. “I couldn’t tell you what he’s planning. But I find it hard to imagine him remaining content with a small church when he could do so much more, and be well-rewarded for his service. And there are certainly safer places to preach than La Rue Sauvage.” Mama bowed her head and spoke in the firm voice she usually reserved for scolding me. 66 “We’ve known Father Abier Vestille for years. We invited him here from Burgundy, after we settled. He’s not cowardly or opportunistic and never has been. He only wants to serve others.” “I certainly understand that,” the Duke said. “But – well, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure if you know him that well, you know the true purpose of his trip to Dijon.” Papa shifted his foot as Mama fell silent. “He didn’t say. Exactly.” The Duke looked from Papa to Mama and back again, still offering a friendly smile. He cleared his throat, sounding uncomfortable. “No matter, Henri. Whatever the reason, I’m certain his trips take precedence. Come. Enjoy the party. We have a wonderful feast.” He strode toward a table filled with rich food and we moved to follow him, though I began to drag my feet. Father Vestille had always been like part of our family. Before last year, he visited our house every Sunday after Mass. We ate lamb or stew and talked about the Scripture lessons and the events in the village and the new dress Mama was making. He sat me on his lap to tell him everything the sheep and Valiant were doing, everything I saw in the field that day, every cloud and flower and insect. Before last year, that is. Before the wolf. “Hey, Helennna,” Francois said, bending down to take my arm. “Hey, let me introduce you to a friennnd of mine.” He waved a heavy hand 67 toward the bar, as though he were trying to fish something out of the air. Mama started toward me, but Papa held her back with an arm around her shoulder. “She’ll be all right. It’s their party. We’re safe in here, at least.” Mama relented and they stepped away with the Duke. A man wearing an apron stepped out from behind the bar and marched toward us. He had strong arms and a broad, crooked smile beneath a mop of reddish-brown hair. Francois waved his arm toward the man and thumped him in the chest. “This’s my bessst friend in all of France. Gerard Touraine. He ownsss the place.” “He’s the one you told me about, right?” I asked. Monsieur Touraine put his hands on his knees and bent toward me. “So you’re the little girl my overbearing friend here rescued. May I say, Mademoiselle, how pleased I am that he did.” I felt myself blush. “Thank you, Monsieur.” “She’s not ssso little anymore,” Francois said with a silly smile. “She just turned eight.” Monsieur Touraine’s eyebrows rose. “Eight? I can tell.” “Thank you,” I beamed. “Like I said,” Francois continued. “If you ever need anything, if you ever need real help, Gerard’sss your man. He’ll take care of you, whateverrr you need. I promissse.” 68 Monsieur Touraine slid a sideways glance at Francois, then smiled back at me. “Well, for now, how about this?” He reached into the front pocket of his apron and pulled out a peppermint stick. “My favorite!” I gasped. “Is it?” Monsieur Touraine asked, grinning at Francois. “Isn’t that a coincidence? I had no idea.” “See what I mean? Anything you need, jussst come to Gerard. He’ll alwaysss take care of you.” Monsieur Touraine put a hand on Francois’s shoulder. “Such as taking care of seeing you home tonight, friend.” Francois sputtered and waved him off. “The Duke’sss servants’re seeing me home tonight. You hearrr that? The Duke’s!” “A hero’s wages,” Monsieur Touraine laughed. He bent to kiss my hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle.” He turned and moved back to the bar, where he poured a drink for one of the men sitting there. “He’s nice,” I said. “The nicccest.” “I’m glad everyone knows you’re a hero now.” “Awww.” Francois blinked, his face turning serious. “You know what a – You know what a hero is, Helena? A hero doesn’t have to be big or strong or sssmart. He just has to stand up to do what’sss got to be done. People might not underssstand what you’re doin’ or why you’re 69 doin’ it. But it’s still got to be done, whether they understand it or not. A hero’s just sssomebody who stands up to do it when nobody else will. That’sss all. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped. All I did was stand up.” I smiled. “Well, you’re my hero.” He grinned at me. “Yeah? Well, you’re mine!” He lifted his bottle toward me. “Cheersss, Mademoiselle.” I clinked my peppermint stick against it. “Cheers, Monsieur.” He took a deep swig from his ale while I sucked on my candy. 70 8. “That was the best party last night,” I beamed, no longer focusing on the needle and thread in my hands. Mama wanted me to practice sewing straight lines on an old patch, but I was too excited. She sat beside me at our dining table, creating a new dress. “It was interesting,” she said, her voice subdued as she stared at the linen and lace spread over her lap. I glanced at my needle to keep from pricking myself. “I met Monsieur Touraine. He 71 owns the tavern and he’s Francois’ best friend. He gave me three peppermints. And we ate peanuts and pretzels and drank ginger beer, and Francois showed me how to blow bubbles in it.” Mama gave a small smile. “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.” I fixed my attention on the needle and thread. “Once I learn how to sew this patch, I can start sewing dresses. And then you can teach me how to sew clothes for you and Papa.” “That’s right, dear. But keep working on that patch first. Careful you don’t get another snarl.” “I’m gonna be a great seamstress, just like you and Grand’Mere Marie.” Her gaze dropped into her lap. “… She made some beautiful things.” I squinted at the needle and thread, still struggling to make a good backstitch. I stopped again. “When I’m older, maybe I can serve at a fancy party. Like the one last night. Except with more ladies. I could make dresses for everyone.” “That would be nice,” Mama said. “Or someone might invite you.” I shook my head. “No. But no one needs to invite me. I just want to make something beautiful for someone to wear. Something bright red. If I can’t have a pretty face, I can still make pretty dresses like you.” Mama stared at the material in her lap, saying nothing. I frowned. “Too bad Father Vestille couldn’t come.” 72 “Yes. We missed seeing him.” I pretended to study my needle. “Mama? Do you think what Monsieur Laurent said is true? Do you think Father Vestille wants to leave?” Her face screwed up. “Not a word. With all respect, our Duke doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” “How do you know for sure? What if Father Vestille wants to move somewhere else, like back to Burgundy?” She put down her sewing. “Father Vestille came here when we learned there had been no priest in La Rue Sauvage for eight years. He’s been here ever since. He has no intention of leaving.” “But that was before.” Her eyebrows rose. “Before what?” I stiffened. “Before the wolf.” She leaned forward. “You imagine he’s running away?” I shrugged. “We never see him anymore. He’s always traveling, always visiting other people. Ever since last year.” She lowered her chin. “Listen to me, Helena. Your father and I trust Father Vestille with our lives. He would not leave without telling us first, if he ever actually considered leaving. And he won’t abandon us.” “But how can you know for certain? What if he’s changed? He’s not like Francois or Duke Laurent. He’s just an ordinary man. Maybe he’s worried there’s another wolf out there.” Mama sighed. “Helena. Father Vestille has always helped us whenever we needed it. He 73 always will. I don’t know what his trips involve. He never wants to discuss it. But I trust him. You don’t have to know all of a person’s activities to know you can depend on them. And you don’t have to be strong or influential to be brave.” I hoped she was right. That Father Vestille would never leave us. But I couldn’t stop wondering. “All right. If you’re certain.” She smiled into her lap, returning to her sewing. “There are many things I’m not certain about,” she said. “But I’m certain of Father Vestille.” I didn’t dare argue with her further. I heard Papa’s boots clomp onto the porch, then stop. We both turned. The front door creaked open, letting in the early morning chill. Papa entered as though he had seen a ghost. “Papa, what’s wrong?” I asked. We had left the banquet early last night and made it home well before nightfall, but Mama and Papa had let me sleep as late as I wanted. My head was still filled with memories of the roast duck and caviar and raspberry tarts, and meeting Monsieur Touraine and the Duke’s friends. What could possibly have spoiled Papa’s mood after such a thrilling party? “Celeste. I need – I need to speak with you.” “Papa?” His eyes warned me to keep still. “Stay inside.” Mama dropped her sewing and swept toward the front door. She hurried outside and Papa shut the door behind her. 74 I stayed inside as I was told and continued working on the practice patch, determined to sew a straight line. My thread snarled into another knot and I grumbled. How could I concentrate when Papa was on the front stoop sharing some dreadful secret? But I kept to my place. I tried to loosen the tiny knot and start over with my line. I didn’t even creep closer to listen. Until Mama wailed. I ran to the door and threw it open. Mama covered her face with both hands, sobbing. Papa held her by the shoulders. She looked as though she might crumple to the ground if he let go. “What happened? What is it?” “Back inside!” Papa barked. I stepped away from his glare of rage. I slammed the door and marched back to the table. I snatched up my patch, with its needle and tangled thread, and slapped it down on the tabletop. Stupid patch! Why couldn’t I at least make something that wasn’t ugly? They were keeping something from me. Something terrible. Like they kept everything else. I couldn’t venture outside. I couldn’t be left alone. I couldn’t go anywhere, even with them, if it got too late in the day. They meant to keep me cooped up in our cottage forever. I slumped back into my chair. I was still seething when the door opened, an inch at a time. Papa trudged in with a wary look, like he was afraid of me. Or of something else. “Helena …” 75 He moved like a sleepwalker to the chair beside me. Mama followed him like a dutiful soldier, head down. Her face red, her eyes squinting and sore. “Helena,” Papa started again. “Something happened to Francois.” “What?” I glanced from one solemn face to the other. “Is Crimson all right?” Papa seemed to stare through me at someone else or someplace else. “I believe so. But Lightning is gone.” “Gone where?” Mama turned aside. The sunlight from the windows glinted off the tears on her cheeks. “Henri, perhaps we should talk about this another time …” “No, Celeste. She’s going to hear it from someone over the next few days. It’s just as well that she hear it from us.” Mama fixed her gaze on me and stiffened. I felt as though they were waiting for something to happen to me. “What’s wrong? Tell me.” Papa swiped his large hands over his face. As if trying to wipe something away. “Helena. … Francois is dead. So is his mare.” I stared at Papa, trying to understand. Stared at his mouth that had just spoken those words. Saw him speak them again, in my mind. He said Francois was dead, just like Grand’Mere Marie was dead. Just like Pierre’s mother. Dead. “… How come?” My throat felt strangled. 76 Papa licked his lips. Glanced from side to side. Sat back a little in his chair. “Some wolves attacked him. In his house.” My mind saw the blue-gray eyes again, shining out of the black tunnel. Shining out of the dark forest. Watching me. Waiting. I breathed deeper. Felt my heart beat faster. “How did they get inside?” Papa scratched at his chin. “His door – somehow came off its hinges. And they all went in.” My temples throbbed, my lip quivering. “How many?” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Looked like four of them, at the least.” “How do you know?” “Henri,” Mama interrupted. “She’s going to hear it,” he repeated. Mama bit her lip. Papa swallowed. He stared straight into my eyes. “What happened to Francois – was very sad. When they found him, he was – he was not in one piece. They tore him asunder. Lieutenant-General Sharrad figures it took at least four of them to do it.” My insides felt hollow as a dead log. “And the mare?” “Henri …” Papa’s eyes continued to burrow into me. “She was the same. All over the stable. They found the foal tied up in its stall. Seemed to be struggling to get out.” “We’ve got to go get him!” I shrieked. 77 Papa paled. “We can’t care for an extra horse, Helena. He needs to go someplace where he can –.” “We’ve got to get him, Papa! We’ve got to bring him home before the wolves come back!” Mama took a step forward. “Francois may have relatives nearby, dear. They might want the foal for –.” “Crimson is mine! Francois promised him to me.” Papa’s eyebrows knit together. “He didn’t so much as promise to –.” “He promised I could ride him. How can I ride him if someone takes him away? How can I take care of him? The wolves came back for Francois. They’ll come for Crimson next.” They exchanged puzzled looks. Mama bent over me. “Darling, what do you mean, ‘the wolves came back’?” “Because Francois saved me. Because he killed one of them, and they wanted revenge.” Papa lowered his head and met my eyes. “Helena. Wolves don’t take revenge.” My eyes narrowed back at his. “They’re not wolves.” They gaped at me as I remembered the wolf looming over me on its hind legs, grinning with its sharp fangs. Those same eyes would always be there, shining in my memory and my nightmares. Mocking me. Threatening me. Terrifying me. “Where’s my cloak?” Their eyes bulged. 78 Mama wrung her hands. “Dear. Why do you ask?” “I want it. Where is it?” “It’s put away,” Papa said, straightening in his chair. “It’s mine. Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. Give it to me.” Mama lowered her chin. “Helena, that is no way to speak to your father.” “Where’s my cloak?” I demanded. I no longer cared what they would do to me for being so brash. Papa’s moustache formed a dark frown. “Helena. You’re never to wear that cloak again.” I turned from them and marched through the cottage. I knocked over books and cleared away half-sewn dresses from Mama’s table. Papa stood. “Calm yourself this instant, young lady.” I rummaged through baskets and pots and wooden boxes. “Where is it? I want to wear it. It’s mine! I want to wear it right now!” “Helena, stop,” Mama begged. I ran to their room at the rear of the cottage. I opened boxes of their personal items, boxes I was never allowed to touch. “It’s my cloak!” “Stop it, Helena,” Papa growled. “Stop now!” I kept digging, past Mama’s leather-bound journal and her flasks of perfume. Past Papa’s snuff pouches and spare cartridges and his old crossbow from the war. “Helena!” 79 Papa’s massive fist closed around my wrist and yanked me away. He held me against his chest as I thrashed about. I didn’t care if he dragged me outside and flogged me with a switch for acting like a spoiled brat. What did it matter if he beat me? What did anything matter anymore? He held me. Held me tight and refused to let me go. I wriggled against him, pounding my small fists on his chest. I shut my eyes, ground my teeth, beat my head against him. Then I collapsed and bawled into his tunic. “I want my cloak,” I cried, gushing tears. “I want to wear my red cloak.” Papa’s breath rustled in and out of his lungs like a bear, as Mama’s gentle hands stroked my hair. “I’ll ask about the horse,” Papa said at last. “We can build another stall for the stable.” 80 9. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over the body of Francois Revelier. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as if he could see the body beneath the heavy lid. “I did not know 81 Francois Revelier well,” he said. “I wish I did. What I do know is that he was a brave man. An honorable man. A man whom others could depend on. As a foreman in his woodcutting business. As a neighbor. And as a friend. Francois Revelier risked his life in an attempt to save his own neighbor, Marie Justine. He heard her cries too late to rescue her, but because of his bravery, his compassion, and his willingness to act, he rescued her granddaughter, Helena Basque, who sits here among us today.” He extended an open hand toward me. Several heads turned. Staring at me and my scars. “Because of his swift and courageous action, the Basque family – and all of us as well – were spared sorrow upon sorrow. They lost a beloved mother that day, a kind woman I knew back in Burgundy, who moved here to be with her daughter and their family.” Mama withdrew a lace handkerchief, one she had embroidered herself, and wiped at her eyes, sniffing. “Francois was a good neighbor to her, to the very end,” Father Vestille continued. “If he could have given his life for hers, I believe he would have. Because that is what he was willing to do for Helena.” Mama wrapped her arm around me and squeezed me closer. “It is ironic – and tragic – that he should suffer the same fate as Marie Justine, a year after destroying the wolf that claimed her life.” Father Vestille paused, as though thinking of something 82 else. Something important. Then he went on. “We can’t fully understand these events, any more than we can understand any such tragedy. But I hope we can all agree on one thing. Whether we knew Francois as a close friend or neighbor, or only heard of his actions in saving young Helena, Francois Revelier was a hero.” I felt as though my guts had been hollowed out. Father Vestille was right. Francois was a hero. But now he was gone. And the wolves were still out there. Who else would stand up to them? The Mass ended. Papa and Monsieur Leóne joined four other men to carry the casket outside. They secured thick ropes under it and lowered it down into a dark rectangular pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Francois there in the dirt forever. “I don’t understand,” Pierre said, suddenly beside me. “Don’t understand what,” I said. My throat felt like dry leaves. “Those wolves. Four of them, maybe more. Just breaking into Francois’ house and attacking him all at once. Like they meant to do it.” I said nothing. I just stared into the dark hole. “Red. That animal we saw, in the tunnel near the bridge. You think that might have been one of them?” “… yes.” “We should have said something. Somebody could’ve stopped it.” 83 I kept staring into the emptiness. Wondering if Pierre was right. But who could we have told? Who would have stopped that wolf, let alone the others? “We gotta be careful,” Pierre went on. “Things like that running around, attacking out of nowhere. I can understand why your parents don’t go out at night.” “Pierre!” I glanced to see Monsieur Leóne beckoning Pierre away. He was speaking to a couple of people I didn’t recognize. “I think Papa’s gathering some new clients. Probably wants me to talk to them, too, to discuss what we can make for them.” He touched my shoulder. “Red. You all right?” I stood stiff and unmoving. Then I nodded, for Pierre’s sake. “Just take care, all right? Those wolves make me nervous.” He hurried away to join his father. “They’re not wolves,” I muttered to no one. At the back of the crowd, I saw Francois’ friend, Monsieur Touraine. He stared sadly at the hole where Francois was laid, but his gaze soon turned blank. I wanted to speak to him, but he turned suddenly and disappeared. “I’ll write to the court again,” Duke Laurent was telling Papa, as he and Mama approached from behind me. “I’ll send Simonet there in person if I have to. Maybe the guards will let him through. Or at least recognize the urgency. They have to see we need soldiers and hunters here 84 to help Lieutenant-General Sharrad’s police kill these things.” “I would appreciate that, Monsieur,” Papa said, sounding numb. Almost as numb as I felt. “Helena. Are you ready to go? Did you get to speak to Father Vestille?” I turned, spotting Father Vestille shaking hands with a couple of guests across the graveyard. “No,” I said, my senses burning. “Not yet.” I strode straight past Papa and Mama and Duke Laurent toward Father Vestille, as he smiled and nodded and showed his concern for the couple talking to him. A couple of people I had never seen before. People he must have visited all of last week, when he disappeared on another of his frequent journeys. Father Vestille lowered his head and spoke quietly with them, a man and a woman in a plain cloak and shawl, which the woman curled about her shoulders as she listened. Seeing me, Father Vestille stopped speaking abruptly. He managed a small smile. “Helena. I want you to meet some friends of mine. This is Monsieur and Madame Serrone, from DeSarte. They came to –.” “Where were you? Where did you go?” I glared up at him, fists clenched. I knew his friends were gaping at me in shock but I didn’t bother looking. I couldn’t care less about them. “I was – visiting some friends.” Father Vestille tugged at his collar with two fingers. “I went to DeSarte, to visit the Serrones here, and some others at their parish.” 85 “That’s why you couldn’t come to Francois’ party?” His Adam’s apple shifted as he swallowed, like a minstrel performer who had forgotten his next line. Did he assume no one would question him? Where he went, what he did? And why? “I wanted to come. I simply – There were other matters I had to attend to, Helena. I’m sorry I couldn’t be with you.” “That doesn’t help anyone now. Does it?” “Helena!” Papa barked. “Mind how you speak to Father Vestille.” He bent down behind me, his harsh breath on my neck, but I didn’t turn. I kept staring into Father Vestille’s pleading eyes. “I’m – sorry, Helena,” Father Vestille said. “I would have come if I could.” “But you couldn’t,” I finished. “Because you had to visit your other friends.” “Helena, that is enough,” Papa growled. As I held Father Vestille’s gaze, his lip quivered. I didn’t care. He should have been sorry. So should Duke Laurent, for not making the King listen and send soldiers. So should Papa and Monsieur Leóne, for doing so little to stop the wolves themselves, and Mama for pretending everything would be all right. Why wouldn’t anyone do something? Francois was the only one willing to act, and now he was gone. “Helena, we’re going home,” Papa said. I didn’t turn to him. I just kept staring into Father Vestille’s sunken eyes. Then I whirled and 86 marched straight toward our wagon. “We don’t have a home.” “Helena!” Papa shouted. His voice broke off as he started to call me again, and I knew Mama’s calming hand was on his arm. I heard her speak gently to Father Vestille. “Please forgive her, Father. She’s angry.” I marched to the wagon, ready to knock aside anyone who stood in my way. Yes, I thought. I’m angry. 87 10. Crimson thundered across the grass, kicking up dirt and fallen leaves as I pulled back on his reins for an abrupt halt. I had grown taller in the last eighteen months, to sit high in the saddle. And I had ridden Crimson so much over the summer that I felt we could read each other’s minds. I barely needed to pull the reins anymore, in any direction, to tell him what I wanted him to do. “Watch this, Mama!” From the front stoop, Mama looked up from her sewing. She cast another glance toward 88 the darkening forest, before returning her attention to me. Papa had been gone all day on his hunt. “Turn!” I called, nudging Crimson’s flanks and tugging the reins to the left. Crimson spun in a dizzying circle. Once, twice, a third time. Then he stomped his front hooves to stop as I pulled back on the reins. “Be careful, dear,” Mama said. “I’m always careful. Watch this!” I nudged Crimson again and we charged at the sheep pen, kicking up dirt as we stopped abruptly at the edge of the gate. The sheep bleated in terror and nearly fell all over themselves. “Did you see that, Mama? They’re hilarious!” “Helena. Don’t scare the sheep.” I frowned. What else was there for me to do? The horses and sheep were all fed and watered. And I had long since given up on learning how to sew. I would never have Mama’s patience. But I had finally discovered something I could master. I could ride. For the first year since Francois was killed, Crimson and I had simply played, running back and forth in the yard. At times, he needed me to calm him, at the sound of a wolf’s howl. Not to calm his fears, but his rage, as he searched about the yard for the source of the sound, ready to charge after it. I coaxed him with pieces of apple or sugar at first, and he soon learned to calm at the sound of my voice. Papa worried that it was too soon to saddle Crimson at the start of the summer, soon after my 89 ninth birthday. But Crimson was strong and seemed eager for it. When he saw the saddle in Papa’s hands, he stomped at the ground, then stayed steady and quiet as Papa fit him with it. As if he wanted me to ride him the way he had seen other visitors ride their horses. We started slowly at first, as Papa led me in a circle around the meadow. Within two weeks, Crimson and I could ride on our own. Which we did every day, for the rest of the summer. “Mama!” I called again as I climbed off the saddle. She looked up. I moved to Crimson’s right side and stuck my left foot in the stirrup. Then I grabbed the saddle’s horn and shouted, “Hah!” Crimson trotted toward the stoop as I hung alongside him, one foot in the stirrup, the other dangling in the air. Mama dropped her sewing. “Helena!” “It’s all right, Mama. I’ve been practicing.” She was still standing with her delicate fists clenched as we trotted up to her, her eyes bulging as I jumped down. “See, Mama? I’m fine.” She said nothing. Just stared at me, her breathing shallow and rapid against the lace bodice of her dress. Crimson snorted and turned toward the forest. I glanced back to see Papa approaching on Royale. A thin animal carcass, tied to the rear of his saddle, scraped a trail through the piles of dead leaves behind him. “Papa!” I called. 90 He waved toward us and continued plodding closer. He always seemed to ride home slowly after a hunt, and this one had obviously been difficult. I turned to Mama. “Can I ride over the hill? Just to the other end of the meadow?” “You know you can’t. Especially near dark.” “Papa goes out.” “Papa hunts.” Royale trudged closer through the scraping leaves. I climbed back onto the saddle and urged Crimson to race toward him. “Papa! I learned a new trick!” “Helena, wait!” He held up a hand, looking alarmed. “It’s all right, I can do it!” I called as we drew near them. “What did you –?” The carcass behind them was a black wolf. Crimson whinnied. I tugged back on his reins and gasped, as his hooves kicked up dirt and leaves. Crimson snorted and stomped again. I patted his head to calm him. “Papa! What –? Why did you –?” “I was chasing a rabbit. So was this thing. I missed the rabbit but shot him.” His face turned to stone. “It’s meat.” I settled Crimson down with some effort. Then I made him canter forward at an easy pace. We paused behind Royale and I stared at the silent animal while Crimson quivered and snorted beneath me. 91 The wolf’s claws were open, as if they could still strike. The twisted jaws and fangs looked ready to devour. The open, unseeing eyes stared mindlessly at the sky. They were not blue-gray. I steadied my breathing as I studied the wolf. The wolf Papa had brought to our home. “It was all I could find,” he said in a softer tone. I focused on breathing in and out. In and out. “I understand,” I said. I turned Crimson away and urged him back to the cottage. Crimson tossed his head and gave another snort of agitation. He surely felt the same rage, seeing the creature that took his own mother from him last year. Though this animal was different from that monster. This was just an ordinary wolf. Mama gasped as Papa arrived at the front stoop. “Henri! What on earth –?” “All I could find,” he repeated. “Couldn’t let good meat go to waste. It’s dinner.” The sun continued to sink toward the horizon. The sky would grow black in another few hours and we would shut ourselves inside. I half-turned. “It’s dead?” “Of course,” Papa said. “I shot it.” I looked back at the horizon, shivering, though not because of the evening chill. “It’s all right,” I said. I heard Papa climb down from the saddle. Heard him untie the animal. The animal I didn’t want to see, though I already saw it in my every nightmare. 92 I set my jaw. “Turn,” I ordered Crimson, tugging his reins. We turned about to face it. The long black animal that could no longer harm anyone or anything, because Papa had shot it. It could no longer attack me, except in my dreams. It was dead. Crimson bristled beneath me, but he settled as I stroked his flank. As we faced the wolf together. Papa carried it to the carving table next to the sheep pen, as Crimson and I watched. Mama wrung her hands and followed him. I climbed down from Crimson’s back and led him toward them. Mama stared at the furry beast stretched across the flat surface. I heard Papa mutter, “It was the best I could do, my dear.” “I know,” she murmured back. She heaved a slow sigh, then held out her hand. Papa tugged the cleaver up from the wooden tabletop where he had buried it that morning. He handed it to Mama, then walked back toward the house. Mama stared at the dead beast another moment before she swung the cleaver down to hack off its head. Blood spurted up and dirtied her lace dress. She didn’t bother trying to clean it off. I hitched Crimson to the porch and followed Papa into the house. He grabbed his pipe from the mantle and lit it, then sat in his rocking chair, puffing away. I stood nearby but he would 93 not look at me, as he kept puffing and rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. “Papa, teach me to hunt.” He gagged and coughed a couple of times, his muddy boots stamping the floor as he bent forward. I feared he might choke on his tobacco. “… What did you say?” “Teach me to hunt,” I repeated. He continued to stare at me. Then he looked away, returning to his rocking and smoking. “You don’t need to hunt anything,” he said with a dismissive air. I relaxed my shoulders and stood taller. “You won’t always be around. I can’t stay indoors forever. Someday I’ll have to go out. And I’ll have to be prepared, if I ever meet one of them.” He waved me off. “No,” he said in a harsher tone, his smoke permeating the room. “You don’t need to worry about those wolves. They’re not your concern. Duke Laurent will have the King send soldiers to handle them.” I took a step forward. “Papa. No soldiers are coming. We’re the only soldiers we have.” He puffed in silence, staring at nothing. He leaned forward and swiped his hand over his forehead. As if he wanted to wipe away everything that had happened. Grand’Mere’s death. My scars. Francois’ death. All the terror we lived with for the last two years. But nothing could wipe it away and he knew it. I could tell, as he hung his head and shut his eyes. 94 “I know you want to protect me, Papa. But even if I stayed here forever, what’s to stop the wolves from breaking in the windows, like they did at Francois’ house?” His eyes flashed at me in a sudden rage. As if he had never considered that possibility. Or as if he had considered it for many nights since Francois’ death, but knew he could do nothing about it. “Papa, I need you to really protect me. Protect me by showing me how to protect myself.” He stared at the far wall, as if I no longer stood in the room. He puffed at his pipe, the smoke rising in gray wisps. “I’ll think on it,” he said. “Go settle the horses.” I walked out front, leaving him to smoke, his head in his hand. I stepped outside and unhitched Crimson. Then I gathered Royale by the reins and led him past Mama to the stable, settling him in his stall and giving him some water. I stepped outside the stable to catch Crimson’s eye and whistled for him. He sprang from his place and charged at me in a gallop. He knew how fast to come by how shrill and sharp I whistled. He snorted once at the wolf carcass as he passed, then thundered to a stop beside me. I patted his head and hugged his neck. “Good boy, Crimson. That was fast. Someday you might even beat Diamond.” Crimson tossed his head and snorted again, as if he knew I was daring to compare him with Pierre’s horse. I led him back to his stall with my hand on his back, as he shook twice. 95 “I know,” I said, petting him. “I know you’re angry about the wolf. But it’s not the thing that killed your mother. It’s just a wolf, and it’s dead. And someday we’ll figure out how to get rid of those things, whatever they are. All right? We’ll make sure they never hurt anyone again.” After removing both of their saddles, I drew Crimson’s water and petted him some more, wishing I could ease his mind. He continued to stamp and fidget, glancing back at the stable entrance twice. As if the wolf could rise from Mama’s work table and attack us. I kept petting him. “It’s all right. You’re safe with me now. And I won’t let anything hurt you, ever again.” I continued to smooth his mane and his neck, and he breathed easier. Then he perked up and glanced at the entrance. Papa stood there within the stable, his hands at his sides. The pipe smoldered silently from his hip. His mustached face was in shadow within the waning light and I couldn’t see his features. “If you wish to hunt, you must do exactly as I say, without question. You will step where I tell you to step. You will keep silent when I tell you to keep silent. You will shoot when I tell you to shoot. Whatever I tell you to do, you cannot hesitate. Understood?” I shuddered. “Yes, Papa.” He stood there, a husky shadow, as if we stood in someone’s tomb. “You’ll rise early tomorrow. As soon as you finish your chores, we’ll head into the woods.” 96 The woods. Where the black wolf spoke to me. Where it watched and waited for me as I hurried to Grand’Mere’s house. “… yes, Papa.” His shadow nodded, then brought the smoldering pipe to his lips and strode back to the house. I stood there, frozen. I petted Crimson again, my fingers trembling against him. “You see? I told you. There’s nothing to worry about. We’re going to learn how to hunt, and then we won’t have to be afraid of anything anymore.” I laid my head against his, wondering how I would make myself sleep tonight. “Everything’s going to be all right, Crimson, I promise,” I said. “Tomorrow morning, we’re going back into the woods.” 97 98 99 MY RISE 100 101 11. I smiled and patted Crimson’s neck as Papa and Royale led us out of the dark forest. The large buck I had shot scraped through pine needles on the ground behind Royale, tied to his saddle. It was my twelfth deer since we had started hunting over a year ago. Papa kept glancing back at it, beaming. He said this one was bigger than any animal he had ever killed. Before we mounted the horses to head home, he actually chuckled and clapped me on the back. 102 Sunlight glinted through the trees, now in full bloom, their leaves still wet with mist and mountain fog. I closed my eyes a moment. I no longer minded feeling the sun on my triple-scarred face. The long days of summer were just a month away, when we could stay outside longer, riding and hunting. I unfastened the side holster of Crimson’s saddle, which held Papa’s crossbow. He had given me his old weapon from the war to use for hunting, until I was ready to borrow his musket. But I never felt the need to switch. I loaded a bolt and hung the crossbow’s front end down over my right shoe as we rode. I looped its front strap over my toe and yanked up tight, feeling my firm bicep muscle twitch as I locked the bolt into place. “What are you doing back there, Helena?” Papa asked, not bothering to look. “Keeping myself ready.” I could hear the smile in his voice, as he relaxed in the saddle and took in the view of the fir and pine trees. He had trained me to stay prepared, to watch for signs of danger, to survive against predators in the forest. He hardly asked me questions anymore while we hunted, but whenever he did, I answered correctly. “Ready for what?” he asked. “Anything.” He chuckled again. “Exactly, sweetheart. Exactly.” I sat taller in the saddle, enjoying the easy ride home, the gentle breeze on my face, and the sounds of the waking forest. When we had started 103 hunting, every rustling leaf or calling bird made me flinch. I had tripped over my dress several times trying to cross a stream or climb over large rocks. I lost three slippers in the mud before Papa built me a pair of wooden shoes. I wanted boots like his, but we could hardly afford a second pair, just to train a girl how to hunt. The first few months, I didn’t have the strength to even arm the crossbow, let alone shoot straight. When I did shoot, I was terrified. Afraid of missing and afraid of killing. “Shove your fear aside,” Papa had told me. “Shove it aside and shoot.” I followed all of his instructions, as I had promised. No matter how pointless or exhausting it seemed. No matter how many bruises and cuts and open blistering sores my mother had to clean off of me later. Until I learned to clean them myself. Over the last eighteen months, I had grown stronger, faster and stealthier. I learned to measure the landscape before entering it, to avoid snapping twigs or slipping on a muddy patch of ground. A few months ago, I finally developed the strength to arm my crossbow from the saddle, something even a boy my age would struggle to do. I enjoyed my new strength, to help Papa lift a deer carcass from the ground. To chase Valiant through the meadow for several minutes before I started breathing heavily. And to carry two large buckets of water from the nearby well, though Papa still watched me travel the whole distance, resting on the porch with his musket ready. 104 But he allowed me more and more freedom and asked me to help with more chores. I turned eleven last month, and I had developed strength and skills to rival that of most boys. Strength to survive. As we broke through the trees to enter our meadow, Valiant barked from his place beside the sheep pen and ran to meet us. Mama watched from the stoop as we approached. She didn’t stand like she usually did, but kept sewing. My kill today would catch her attention. I led Crimson to trot over to her, beaming as Papa and I dismounted to untie the deer. Together, we dragged it to the carving table and hoisted it up. The heavy buck’s antlers cracked as it struck the oak surface in a heap. Mama’s nose wrinkled as if a skunk had sprayed us. “A good hunt?” she asked. I spread my hands toward the enormous deer and smiled, saying nothing more. Valiant barked, as if voicing his agreement. “Come inside and wash up,” Mama said. “Your father can clean the deer.” “It’s a large one,” he said. “I would like some help to –.” “I want a few moments to speak with Helena.” Papa gaped. Mama rarely dared to interrupt him. He bent to retrieve the cleaver that the deer’s carcass had knocked to the ground, wiped it on his tunic, and set to work. They must have agreed beforehand on whatever Mama wished to discuss. I couldn’t tell if it might be good or bad news, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t afraid anymore. 105 Of anything. Then she led me inside and told me she was going to have a baby. 106 12. “Can’t catch me!” Suzette giggled, dodging this way and that through our meadow. Her wooly blanket trailed behind, clutched in her tiny fist as she ran her hardest in the waning sunlight. “Oh, I’ll catch you!” I laughed back, stepping sideways to block her escape. “Or I will!” Pierre said, rushing to her other side. Suzette squealed as Valiant ran around us all, barking. We pretended my four-year old sister was too fast and agile for two fifteen-year olds to grab. We reached for her, missing each time, 107 which made her laugh harder. “Come here, you!” I demanded in a playful tone. “No!” she called, her short legs turning awkwardly to hurry away. Pierre was better at pretending. He kept jumping right next to Suzette, while Valiant barked around his ankles to make sure he wasn’t harming her. Then he would nearly snatch the back of her cotton dress before his fingers closed on empty air. “Missed again! I can’t believe it!” “Too bad for you!” Suzette called. I leaped in front of her as she turned away from the bare trees of the forest. She shrieked and retreated as Pierre barred her escape in the other direction. Then I landed behind her and seized the trailing end of her blanket. “My woolie!” She grinned and grunted as she tugged at her blanket, refusing to let go. I dragged her closer and scooped her into the air. “We got her!” Pierre called. He knelt down to pet Valiant, who had started to growl. “Got you by your fuzzy woolie!” I said. I knew she wouldn’t release it. Mama made it for her two years ago and Suzette had held tight to it ever since, the way I used to guard my red cloak. She struggled to pull free. “Lemme go! And gimme my fuzzy woolie or I’ll beat your head! Nngh!” Her tiny fingers tried to pry my arm loose. Until I turned her around and held her against my chest. Then she threw her blanket over my shoulder, flung her arms around my neck and held on tight. “Take me for a big ride.” 108 “All right, hang on!” I trotted like a horse, running in small circles around the chilly meadow, while Pierre ruffled Valiant’s fur. Suzette giggled as I bounced her up and down. Crimson snorted at us from the sheep pen, where he had been trotting. I had trained him to stay close by, even when he wasn’t hitched up, to show Papa how well we could take care of ourselves. Crimson appreciated the freedom, but now he seemed eager to join us. Winter was coming, and he wouldn’t have many days left to gallop before being cooped up in the barn until springtime. “No, no!” Suzette said, laughing. “Take me for a big ride on Crimson!” I whirled her around in the air and plopped her down on her feet. Crimson paced before the sheep pen like a guard dog, stealing glances at us. I bent toward Suzette and lowered my voice. “You know we can’t ride very long.” “I know, I know,” she said with a frown. She rolled her eyes and made a stern face like Papa’s. “‘It’s almost dark, girls. We don’t wanna be caught out after dark.’” “That’s right,” I said, stifling a smile. “But we can gallop twice around the meadow if you want.” She shook her head and leaned toward me with a wicked grin. “Let’s go scare all the sheeps,” she said. I glanced sideways at our empty front porch. “… I don’t know.” 109 “Aw, come on! Papa won’t hear us. They’ve been talking in there for days!” “More like an hour.” “Don’t know about what?” Pierre asked. I curled my lip. “Suzette wants to scare the sheep.” Pierre raised an eyebrow. “You told me what he said last time you did that.” “They probably won’t even hear us from the house,” I suggested. “Probably not,” he agreed. “Mama could probably keep your mother talking all night, if she wanted.” “I like Madame Lisette,” Suzette said, curling her arms around her blanket. “She plays with me.” “I like her, too,” I said. I cocked my head at Pierre. “You call her ‘Mama’?” He shrugged. “Sure. She’s been my stepmother over a year now.” “But you still miss your mother?” “Yeah,” he said, nodding sideways at the house. “But she’s my mother now.” “I suppose.” “Will you guys stop talking about mothers and start scaring the sheeps?” Suzette demanded, jamming her fists on her hips. We laughed. “Sorry, Suzette.” “What were we thinking?” Pierre said. He glanced at the porch for any sign of movement. “Just be careful, Red.” 110 “How come you always call Helena ‘Red’?” Suzette asked. “Is it ‘cause of her scratches on her face? ‘Cause that’s not nice.” Pierre shuddered. “Uh, no. Of course not. It’s because, uh …” I put up a hand. “She’s just curious.” I bent toward Suzette. “It’s because I used to wear a red cloak all the time, Suzette. When I was around your age.” “But you don’t anymore. So how come he calls you that still?” I smiled. “Some things just stick with you.” Suzette waved me off. “All right, fine. You can be ‘Red’. Let’s just scare the sheeps.” “All right, Silly.” I whistled for Crimson. He galloped straight at us. I peered around his flank to eye the porch once more. Pierre looked over his shoulder from the grass as he kept Valiant still. It always felt so peaceful when the Leónes came to visit. Monsieur Leóne seemed content with Madame Leóne, who was as good a seamstress as Mama. Their wedding two summers ago brought us a breath of fresh air, after years of gloom. Nearly as refreshing as the day Suzette was born. Signs of new life, that people could start over. And Pierre seemed even happier than usual since the wedding. Over the last few years he had grown stronger, a few inches taller, and far more confident. He had become highly skilled as a blacksmith’s apprentice, but he never even talked about it unless someone needed his assistance. He 111 treated all of our animals well, and he was wonderful for Suzette. I couldn’t think of a single day when he had failed to make her smile. I lifted Suzette onto Crimson’s back and placed her in front of the saddle. She sucked on her blanket as I hoisted myself up behind her. “Hold on tight,” I said. I wrapped my arm around her and she coiled her tiny arms around mine. Then she squealed as I urged Crimson forward and we charged at the sheep pen. The sheep heard us thundering at them and paused, searching all around for the source of the tremors. Spotting us, a few of them panicked and nearly stumbled sideways over one another, while the others kept chewing on their straw. “Run! Run, sheeps!” Suzette cried. “We’re gonna get you, sheeps!” “HELENA!” I yanked on the reins. Crimson skidded to a halt. I clutched Suzette so tight I feared I might cut off her air. Instead of wheezing, she laughed. I sat up and turned toward Papa’s booming voice. Pierre clenched his teeth, wincing at me. “Yes, Papa?” I asked in a quiet voice. Papa stood on the porch, his face flushed around his black frown of a moustache. “What on earth are you doing? You trying to give them a heart attack?” “Papa, the sheeps are so really funny!” Suzette giggled. 112 His face darkened. “They won’t be so really funny if they’re dead.” “But, Papa! You should’ve seen how the sheeps –!” I nudged her. “Hush, Suzette. Trust me, he knows.” Papa continued to glower at us, until even Crimson looked away. “Helena, I suggest you show more care around our flock, if you plan to join me on the hunt tomorrow.” “When can I go on a hunt?” Suzette asked. “I wanna go on a hunt tomorrow, too.” Papa blinked. “When you’re much older.” “I’m much older now. I just turned four. That’s as old as Helena was when it was the first time she hunted.” “I was nine,” I told her. “So? I’m almost nine, too.” I smiled. “Four is not almost nine. Or even close.” She soured and looked away. “Well, it is to me.” “All right, girls, get inside,” Papa said, waving us into the house. “It’s almost dark. We don’t want to be caught out after dark.” I tightened my lips to hold in a laugh. “Papa!” Suzette called, laughing out loud. “We were just saying –!” “Hush, Suzette!” I told her. “Let’s get Crimson bedded and go inside.” I dismounted and lifted Suzette down, then led Crimson to the stable. It was one of the few times I had to take his reins. He didn’t like being 113 cooped up in the stable, and I hated leaving him there, out in the open air. At least we had a lock on the door. Pierre joined us with a guilty smile. “Sorry, Red. I was watching you and Suzette ride and suddenly he was right there.” Valiant barked at Pierre’s heels, as if supporting his claim. “He has a way of doing that. It’s all right. Papa will forget about it eventually.” He entered the dusty stable with us. I unsaddled Crimson and stroked his neck to calm him, like always. Crimson fidgeted and kept checking Royale’s stall, as if making certain the horse was still there. “Is he always this agitated at night?” Pierre asked. I kept stroking Crimson, speaking in soft tones. “I don’t think he ever got over being trapped in Francois’ stall when the wolves came. He couldn’t do anything to stop it. Just had to stay there and watch, while they –.” I glanced down at Suzette. “Well, Francois’ mare, Lightning, was his mother.” “Helena, how come I can’t hunt? I’ll be good. I wanna be like you.” “Oh, you do?” Pierre bent down beside her. “You wanna shoot rabbits from fifty feet away like Red?” I blushed. “Pierre. That was only one time.” He ignored me and dropped to one knee, spreading his hands to make it more dramatic. “Your papa told me about it,” he said as Suzette 114 sucked on her blanket. “He and Red were out early one morning and they spied this rabbit way up ahead, moving behind an oak tree. They didn’t want to move any further or the horses would’ve scared it off. So they stood there, drawing their weapons. Your papa’s musket and Red’s crossbow.” “It’s actually Papa’s crossbow, from the war, actually,” Suzette told him. She learned the word “actually” last month and now used it whenever she could. “Sure, I know. Anyway, they were about fifty feet away, too far to get a good shot, so they were gonna creep up closer. Your papa took one step forward, real quiet. Then something spooked the rabbit. Maybe he sensed they were there, I don’t know. But he took off running and your papa figured they had lost it. But while he was thinking that, Red drew her crossbow in a flash. She fired one shot, straight at the rabbit, and sent it flying into a tree behind it. One shot. Fifty feet away. It was amazing. Your papa came bragging about it the same day at my papa’s shop, kept telling it to everybody who would listen. Some folks didn’t believe him, but I’ve heard plenty of other stories about Red’s hunting, so I know it’s true. She’s a better hunter than any of the men in town, but nobody wants to admit it.” “All right, Pierre, that’s enough,” I said, my cheeks burning. “Don’t fill her head with stories.” “Well, it’s true.” 115 I sighed, not wanting to discuss the details with both of them together. “It wasn’t exactly fifty feet.” “No?” “No,” I said firmly. I turned away, keeping my smile to myself. By Papa’s measure from the trees where we stood, it was fifty-eight. Actually. “Well, it’s still an impressive shot, Red. One of many.” His eyes lit up and he turned back to Suzette. “Your papa told me about another time when they –!” “Pierre, no more hunting stories. It’s time to settle down for the night.” “I like Pierre’s hunting stories!” Suzette complained. “How come I can’t go hunt with you and Papa, just for one time?” I stroked Crimson’s neck, as his eyes darted back and forth at the stable’s confining walls. Yes, how come? I wondered. Like Papa always said, we needed to be ready. Ready for anything. Pierre felt I could handle myself well enough. But what about Suzette? Who would protect her when the wolves came? I hugged Crimson’s neck, my fingers brushing back his mane as he gradually relaxed. “I’ll talk to Papa,” I said. “No promises.” Suzette’s whole face brightened. “Yay! I’m gonna be like you!” Pierre stood, looking pleased with himself. I hoisted Suzette into my arms. “Well, I want to be like you,” I said, stepping outside. She started one of her silly songs. “I wanna be like you, and you wanna be like me. And we 116 wanna be like Crimson. And Crimson wants to be a tree.” I set her down to close the stall door and lock it. “I doubt Crimson wants to be a tree.” “He has to. ‘Cuz that’s what rhymes.” “Why don’t we let Crimson be whatever he wants.” She ignored me and started up again, dancing in a circle. “And Crimson wants to be a tree. Or a butterfly. Or a frog. And Pierre likes to call you ‘Red’. ‘Cuz you blush when he’s around – !” “Shush!” I scolded her in a sharp voice. “Well, you do. Go see your face. It’s all –.” “‘Quiet’, I said. It’s almost time for bed.” “No, it’s not, either. I can –!” “Shush,” I told her, picking her up again to settle her. Suzette grumbled and sucked on her blanket, while Pierre tightened his lips, looking amused. I forced an awkward smile. “… She’s four.” He nodded with a grin. We heard a horse approaching. Shadowed against the setting sun, Father Vestille trotted toward our stoop on his gray Palomino. My gut went hollow. “Hello, Helena! Pierre! Suzette!” “Father Vestille!” Suzette squirmed like a fish until I set her down. She ran at Father Vestille, waving her blanket. He climbed down from his saddle and scooped her up. “Oh, you’re so heavy!” he joked. “How much candy have you eaten today?” 117 She giggled. “I’m not heavy, neither, Father Vestille.” He held her over his head and twirled her about. The same way he did with me, when I was only a child. “I can barely lift you!” he said. Suzette squealed, Pierre laughed, and Valiant barked. As I stood rigid, watching them. “Time to get inside, Suzette,” I said at last. “Awww.” Father Vestille stopped, surprised. He managed a smile and set her down. “Your sister’s right. Sorry I’m visiting so late in the day.” “Abier! How are you?” Papa appeared on the porch, with Mama and the Leónes behind him. He marched at Father Vestille and gave him a strong embrace. “How have you been, Henri?” They broke apart, looking a bit awkward. “We didn’t know when you’d be back,” Papa said. “Neither did I. I wanted to let you know I’ll be here this Sunday.” “We still gather.” Papa nodded toward the smiling group on the porch. “I’ve been leading prayers. Last weekend we discussed showing honor to the King, in spite of any rumors and misgivings.” He smiled sheepishly. “It was a humbling experience.” Father Vestille laughed and clapped him on the back. “You’re a good man, Henri. There’s no one I would rather have leading prayers when I’m away.” “Come inside. Have some wine.” They started toward the house. 118 “Only a little. I want to be up early tomorrow, visit some people in the village. I just got back and came here first.” “Why are we so special?” I asked. Papa and Father Vestille stopped where they stood. Everyone gaped at me. Father Vestille gave me his kindest eyes, the ones I remembered from years ago. “Because there’s no one I care more about than you and your family, Helena.” I said nothing. Just stared back at him. Mama stepped down from the porch and extended a hand toward him. “Come on in. Lisette brought over some fresh bread. She’s trying to convince me to start a clothing business together.” Father Vestille smiled. “You should. Between the two of you, you could already supply nearly half the dresses of the village.” Mama laughed. Madame Leóne stuck her hands on her hips with a clever grin. “Well, Father Vestille, most women won’t buy half a dress.” Everyone laughed, including Pierre, making Valiant bark again. I stiffened and waited for everyone to go inside. “Madame Lisette!” Suzette called, running to her. “Madame Suzette!” Madame Leóne smiled and squatted down. “How may I be of service?” Madame Leóne was beautiful like Mama, but in a different way. Although a few years older, she always looked radiant, her eyes crinkling at the corners with constant humor. 119 “I want you and Mama to make a special hunting dress ‘cuz I’m gonna go hunting with Helena!” Papa glared at me. So much for easing into the conversation. But he didn’t scold me. He only wrinkled his brow as he continued past Mama, who gaped at me from the porch. “Oh, a special hunting dress,” Madame Leóne said, playing along. “How about a little more blueberry pie instead?” “No! I wanna have my special hunting dress!” “Well, we’ll have to see about that with your Mama and Papa, I think. Come on inside.” Yes, we will, I thought as the adults meandered into the house. Pierre lingered outside a moment with me. Madame Leóne regarded him, then gave me a sly wink before ushering Suzette inside with a hand at her back. Mama threw a smiling glance at me before following them inside. I shook my head at their overactive imaginations. Pierre shoved his hands in his trouser pockets. “How come you’re mad at Father Vestille?” I turned and started walking away, past the bleating sheep. “Who said I’m mad?” “You did, with everything you’re doing. Figured you’d start throwing rocks at him next.” I didn’t want to talk about it. “We used to be close, when I was little,” I said. “Then I grew up. That’s it.” 120 “Red.” He stopped walking and faced me. “You act like he stole your horse. What did he do that’s so horrible?” I stiffened, wanting to turn away yet wanting to answer him. I knew I could still talk to Pierre about anything. Even this. “Nothing,” I said in a feeble voice, feeling myself tremble. “He didn’t do anything. When the wolf attacked, Francois came and killed it. Father Vestille came and helped get me to Doctor Renoire. After that – he stopped coming around.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “He’s at your house all the time.” I shook my head. “He used to visit us every Sunday for lunch and stay until dark. Some weeks he visited us a couple more times. Then the wolf killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me like this, and he started to disappear, making long trips to other provinces. Refusing to tell us where he was or what he was doing or why he had to go. He won’t admit that he’s looking for a better church to lead, in some province that’s not plagued by wolves.” Pierre dug his hands in his pockets and resumed our aimless stroll through the meadow. The sun dipped low, and I expected Papa’s voice to thunder from the front stoop at any moment. Don’t be caught out after dark, Helena. “Doesn’t fit,” Pierre said. “The way he preaches, the way he helps people. He’s been close to your parents since he moved here. Can’t see him moving on to another group of people.” I bit my lip. “Shows how wrong you can be about someone. You think he’ll be there when you 121 really need him. Then when there’s trouble, he’s nowhere around.” “Hmm,” Pierre said. “Well. Glad you’re not mad.” “Look, I just don’t –.” “Easy, Red. I’m teasing you. Will I still see you at Mass Sunday? I can find you a good spot at the back to throw rocks.” “I’ll be there. I can’t tell Mama and Papa I refuse to go. But don’t expect me to listen to anything he says.” Pierre fell silent. “You still pray?” “Of course,” I said. “Every morning and every night. But I haven’t gotten any answers yet.” “You’ve got Suzette, right? I never thought you’d love anything more than that crazy horse of yours. That’s an answer to prayer, isn’t it, having a sister?” I smiled. “Yes. It is.” My heart sank again as I turned toward the dismal forest. “But those things are still out there.” “You mean the wolves?” “They’re not wolves. I heard another lady was attacked a few months ago.” “Yeah, Madame Benoit, the miller’s wife. We went to the funeral.” “Was Father Vestille there?” “Uh, no. He was away. Another priest, Monsieur Benoit’s cousin, came from Dijon to lead the service.” “Hm. Surprising. The one thing Father Vestille rarely misses is a funeral.” 122 “You are really angry at him. Don’t you think you should give him another chance?” I considered that for all of two seconds. “He used to be there for our family. Now he’s not. And I’ve moved on. I needed him back then. I don’t need him now.” Pierre sighed deeply, dropping the subject. “All right. What’re you doing tomorrow?” “Helena!” We turned toward the sound of Papa’s voice, about fifty yards away. I barely noticed how far we had strayed. “Come on back. Pierre’s parents are about to head home and you don’t want to be caught out after dark. And you and I need to talk to your mother about Suzette joining us early tomorrow.” My pulse raced. “Yes, Papa!” I called back. So. He didn’t say that they needed to talk to Suzette, but that the two of us to talk to Mama. “Sounds like I’m going hunting,” I told Pierre. 123 13. The forest was cold and quiet the next morning, hardly a bird left to whistle among the naked branches. But we still hoped to find a few animals roaming about, if we could spot any through the clinging fog. We slowed to a trot and listened for movements. Papa rode ahead on Royale while Suzette sat in front of me on Crimson, clutching her blanket – her “fuzzy woolie”. Still as she was, I kept imagining that her racing heartbeat would frighten off every creature we approached. She had practically bounced up 124 and down when we left the cottage. But Papa instructed her – as he had instructed me on my first hunt – to obey his every command and keep silent in the forest. He put up a hand. I pulled Crimson to a halt. Papa rode Royale a few steps closer, one hoof at a time, his hand still raised to us. Suzette’s pulse thumped against me through her back but she kept still, sucking on her blanket. She would make an excellent hunter one day. As soon as she gave up her fuzzy woolie. My eyes narrowed on the area Papa faced. Then I spotted it: a large white-tailed buck emerging from a cluster of trees, bending to nibble some grass. I might never have noticed it through the dense fog without frightening it away, but Papa had a keen sense for subtle movements. He raised his musket and took aim between the spread antlers. The deer’s head suddenly jerked up as something pounced on top of it. Something large. The enormous shadow spread over the deer, making Suzette scream. I clamped my hand over her mouth as the beast stopped and turned on us. I gasped. It was the wolf, black as night. Its blue-gray eyes stabbed into us as its head rose, as tall as the deer’s neck. The buck staggered to its feet and fled, with the monster chasing it. Papa drove Royale after them. “Papa, stop!” I cried. 125 I tugged on Crimson’s reins. “Hyah!” We galloped after them, my crossbow raised. Suzette squealed and gathered her blanket close to her chest, grasping Crimson’s mane as I goaded him faster. The trees blurred past as I fixed my eyes on Papa and Royale, struggling to keep sight of them rushing through the fog. Ahead of them, I caught shadowy glimpses of the escaping wolf. “Come on, Crimson. Go!” Suzette screamed. “Stop, Helena! Stop!” I ignored her and drove Crimson harder. Royale began to pull away. I barely caught sight of the wolf’s whipping tail. As Crimson leaped over a thick tree root, Suzette slid sideways. She hung from the saddle as we sailed through the air. I yanked on the reins and clutched her to my chest as we toppled over. Crimson fell on my leg like a pile of stones and I screamed. He rose off me instantly, letting my heels slide and fall limply from the stirrups. I lay there and cradled Suzette, trying to stop her from squirming. I bit my lip and waited for feeling to return to my leg. After a few minutes, I managed to calm her down, assuring her I could still walk. My crossbow lay on the ground near my hand. It had fired its bolt when we fell. There was no time to search for it. “Bring me another bolt,” I groaned. Suzette got up quickly, smearing away tears with her blanket. She ran to the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle and returned with a new bolt. I sat on the ground and put my left foot in the crossbow’s loop. I leaned back and tugged 126 the bowstring taut to arm it, thankful to have one strong leg. I crawled to a nearby tree for support and stood to my feet. I limped to Crimson and he nuzzled me with his neck, as I lifted my long skirt to check my injury. The purpling bruise on my thigh and knee would spread over the next few days, but it would heal. A gunshot echoed through the trees. We froze. I grabbed Suzette and lifted her onto Crimson, clenching my teeth against the numbing pain. Gripping the horn tight, I planted my foot in the stirrup and hoisted myself up, swinging my dead leg over his back. Crimson hesitated at first, sensing my injury, but I urged him on and he tore after Papa with all speed. It took less than a minute to reach a clearing where we found the deer. Or rather, its head, ripped from its neck and lying in a pool of blood. There was no body. Near the head, Papa’s musket lay in the dirt, spattered with blood. I blocked Suzette’s eyes with my forearm and stared at Papa’s weapon. Just stared, holding Crimson in position. Unwilling – unable – to move forward. I finally turned Crimson away at a slow canter, leading him and Suzette to some thick brush and trees several yards away. “Wait here.” “Helena. Wasn’t that Papa’s –?” “Wait here, I said!” Suzette sniffed. “Don’t yell.” 127 I cradled her carefully. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to yell. But do as I say. Sit here and keep still.” She sniffed and buried her face in the blanket. “I hate this forest.” I hugged her tight, then swung my leg over the saddle and dropped down. The jarring pain rang all the way from my leg to my neck. I limped all the way back to the clearing to retrieve Papa’s musket. It was still warm. I could smell the gunpowder from its recent shot. He missed shooting whatever attacked him. Or his bullet failed to stop it. Something rustled through the bushes at my left. I dropped the musket and aimed my crossbow at the approaching footsteps. Father Vestille strode from the forest on his Palomino, right into my sight. He flinched as his horse started a little. I lowered the crossbow. “Helena? What –?” “Papa’s missing.” My words came out half-choked. His eyes widened at the bloody musket. He scanned the area. “Which way?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. I didn’t see. Somewhere back that direction.” His face turned to iron. “Take Suzette home and round up some men. Go.” “I’m coming with you.” “Take your sister home!” I bit my lip. I knew he was right. She had already seen too much. But I couldn’t lose the chance to find Papa. 128 I had to trust Father Vestille to find him. I hobbled quickly back to Crimson as Father Vestille galloped off. We raced home, faster than ever. It felt like forever. When we finally reached the cottage, Mama sat waiting on the front stoop, as always. Suzette screamed for her and Mama came running. I left Suzette with her. Suzette babbled, waving her blanket wildly as Mama hugged her tight. Mama turned to me with frantic eyes. “What happened? Where’s your father?” “I don’t know. Father Vestille’s searching for him. I’m going back.” “Helena, wait!” I sped away. I had no time to find more men in the village. Who would I find? Who would listen to me, other than the Leónes? Every moment spent asking for help was another moment lost. We pounded back into the darkness of the forest. A few minutes later, we reached the spot where Father Vestille had met me. I yanked the reins, jarring Crimson to a halt, and listened. Crimson followed my lead and kept still, while my heart beat like a drum. Something wailed. We charged toward it, darting around tree trunks. I ground my teeth, the crossbow in my fist. A dark figure knelt on the ground ahead. Crimson skidded to a halt as I aimed at the man in black. 129 It was Father Vestille, bent over on the ground. Sobbing as he clutched a scarlet cloth to his chest. It was Papa’s tunic. Covered in blood. I smelled the drying puddles of blood scattered throughout the area. I saw pieces of Papa. A scarlet finger. A boot with part of the torn leg still inside. Some piece of indistinguishable flesh lying mangled against a tree trunk. Bile rose at the back of my throat but I stilled it. Crimson snorted and stamped his hooves, sharing my shock and rage. Father Vestille simply wept, doubled over my father’s tunic, rocking back and forth. I searched in all directions, listening, smelling the air. Nothing but pine and decay from my father’s blood. Father Vestille finally rose, clutching Papa’s shirt. He trudged to his horse, hanging his head. His robe covered with Papa’s blood. “We must tell your mother,” he rasped. I kept scanning the trees, kept listening for movement. My grip ached on the crossbow. Something rustled in the bushes. I whirled and fired as a reflex, pinning a small rabbit to the dirt. It let out a pitiful squeal as my bolt pierced its belly. I examined it. Papa would have been impressed by my quick reaction. I studied the rabbit another few seconds. Then bent to grab another bolt from the saddle pouch, loaded it with my left boot, and waited. 130 There were no sounds. Only the bunny’s plaintive cries. No more of Papa’s booming voice, ordering me inside. No more of his smile or his pride in my latest kill. No more of his horsey-rides with Suzette bouncing on his shoulders. No more of his quiet kisses to Mama when he thought we weren’t looking. The forest was still. I dismounted and limped to the rabbit, gritting through the pain. I jammed the bolt deeper and worked it back and forth until the rabbit stopped struggling. I picked it up and tied it to the saddle. “Dinner,” I said as I dragged myself back onto Crimson. “Helena …” Father Vestille began in a broken voice. I met his gaze. “Can’t let good meat go to waste,” I told him, urging Crimson forward. We rode back to the clearing. I pulled Crimson to a halt and climbed down to gather up Papa’s musket. I wiped off some of the blood – Papa’s blood – on my burlap cloak. I cleaned it slowly, thinking about how Papa used his gun. How careful he was in the forest, how quick he was to fire. He must have shot the wolf. But it still killed him. And it still lived, somewhere in the blackness. I secured the musket to Crimson’s saddle beside the hanging rabbit. I mounted, allowing no more tears to start, no time to think. Only to act. I 131 turned at a sudden sound and stared at Father Vestille. “Did you hear that?” He looked about. I had jarred him out of his grief. “I – I don’t know. What did you hear?” I glared at him and wondered if I was going mad. “Perhaps nothing. We should go.” I stared at the path leading out of the forest, setting my jaw. “Don’t want to get caught out after dark.” We turned the horses back to the cottage. But I still felt an unsettling tremor in my spine. I could not possibly have heard what I imagined. Still, I glanced over my shoulder again as we rode toward home. From the dark recesses of the forest, I could have sworn I heard some wild animal laughing. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over Papa’s body. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as though he could see Papa’s face beneath the heavy lid. “Henri Basque – was my dearest friend. A kind man who always looked out for others. Always wanted to provide for others. Protect others. Shelter others. Even in his death, he died protecting his daughters from a dangerous animal as he – as he chased after it.” 132 I sensed people staring at me. I was thankful to have Mama and Suzette beside me, with Pierre and his parents sitting nearby. “Henri and Celeste invited me here after they came and settled, when they saw there had been no priest for several years. They allowed me to stay with them, until I was able to purchase my own hovel. They supported the new church here, attending regularly and helping draw others in. Henri wanted to provide for people’s spiritual needs as well as their material needs. He lived his life providing for others, and he died protecting his daughters.” Mama withdrew one of her embroidered handkerchiefs and dabbed at her bloodshot eyes. She looked too tired to weep anymore. I felt hollow inside as Father Vestille concluded his eulogy. The Mass ended and the casket was carried outside by Monsieur Leóne, Duke Laurent, and four other men. They put thick ropes under the casket and lowered it down into the giant pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Papa’s body there. Pierre stood beside me. “Weird.” I said nothing, but waited for him to continue. “I mean, you’re certain your father wouldn’t have missed. But if he hit the wolf, why couldn’t they find it? It couldn’t have gotten far.” I didn’t answer. I just stared into the dark hole. 133 He cleared his throat. “Sorry, Red. I shouldn’t keep talking about the wolves.” He stepped away to join his parents. I stood stiff and unmoving, saying nothing at all. “I’m so sorry, Madame,” Duke Laurent was telling Mama as he led her gently by the hand. “Henri was one of the best men I’ve ever known.” He had a slight catch in his throat. “If there’s anything I can do for your family, please let me know and it will be done.” “That is very kind of you, Monsieur,” Mama said, sounding frail and numb. She turned tired eyes on me. “Helena. Are you ready to go home?” I nodded, wrapped my burlap cloak around my shoulders, and put an arm around Suzette as she clutched her blanket. We returned home in silence. The Leónes stayed with us that afternoon, along with Father Vestille. I know Mama and Suzette needed their company, but apart from Pierre, I was relieved when they all left before dusk. Leaving the house dark and quiet. Mama wanted to talk to me after she put Suzette to bed but I didn’t feel like talking. I didn’t feel like doing anything at all. I retired early and cried myself to sleep. 134 14. “The beast has returned!” I looked up to see Jacque Denue and his four cronies beside the stoop of the Leónes’ blacksmith shop as I exited with my new crossbow bolts. They stood between me and Crimson, hitched to the post. “Told you this was her horse,” Denue said. He jutted his chin at me. “We told you not to come here anymore, you ugly witch. You deaf or just stupid?” 135 “I’ll leave the stupidity to you, Jacque. Step away from my horse.” “What did you say, you hag? Come here and I’ll beat some sense into you.” “Leave me alone. For your own well-being.” Jacque no longer frightened me, and I was in no mood for his nonsense. As a child, I had longed for Papa to rescue me from this brainless bully. Now, six months after Papa’s death, I had learned to take care of myself, along with Mama and Suzette. I had accompanied them in the forest an hour ago, to provide safe escort to Father Vestille’s hovel in the woods. They wanted me to join them for lunch, but I preferred to hunt. I couldn’t tell them I had no interest in visiting with Father Vestille, despite his frequent invitations over the past several months. Even though Mama said he had made a cake to celebrate my sixteenth birthday. He apparently wished to make up for all the time spent away from us, visiting other provinces the last several years. But I wasn’t interested in his penance. My attention had shifted to more important matters. I had assumed the role of hunter and provider for our family. Mama urged me to rest, to spend more time with them, insisting we had plenty of meat, especially with Father Vestille sharing meals with us. But I kept hunting, kept working. And I kept secretly searching for signs of the wolves that took Papa. But I never found them. They seemed to have gone into hiding, as if 136 frightened by the attention that Papa’s death had brought about. After another fruitless search in the woods, I had driven Crimson into the village of La Rue Sauvage to visit Pierre at his shop. I traded a few kills – a rabbit and three birds – for an order of new crossbow bolts, but lingered a few moments afterward. I had to admit, I found it far easier to make time to visit with Pierre. But entering the village brought its own share of risk, as Jacque Denue and his cruel friends meant to remind me. Denue snorted at a fat boy with food stains on his shirt. “Grab her, Port. I’m gonna give this witch a spanking.” The slob snatched at my arm. I dodged him easily and spun toward him, to hammer my locked fists into his face. He went down hard, but the folds of my skirt bunched around my legs, constricting my movements. As I stepped to one side to free up my movements, a taller boy seized my wrist. His fingers locked on me like a vise and jerked me toward Denue. Denue’s breath smelled of chewing tobacco. I tried to yank myself free but my dress remained twisted, keeping me off-balance. “I dunno how you did that, freak, but you’ll be sorry you did. I’m gonna beat you so bad you’ll never show your face outside again!” He raised his fist. Then something knocked his friend into him, forcing a grunt from Jacque as they both sailed to the ground. I tugged myself free of Muscles and stepped aside. 137 Crimson snorted down at the freckle-faced boy who lay sprawled on top of Denue, grimacing as he massaged his ribs. I felt a wave of relief as Crimson tried to kick at the rest of them. But they backed away from the post where I had tied him. I couldn’t get past them to set him loose. Then Slob picked up a rock and hurled it past my head. “Grab her!” Denue growled. Muscles lunged for me. I dodged, still struggling in my long dress. The others bent to pick up rocks, standing between me and Pierre’s door. I could call for help, but then they would throw rocks at Pierre. I hiked up my skirt and sprinted away. I could outrun them, but I had no place to escape between the closely-packed shops and houses. I hurried down an alley, their feet pounding after me. I crossed the next street and nearly fell beneath the wheels of an approaching carriage. The driver spotted me and jerked on the reins. Behind me, Denue and the others were closing in. I stood and ran to knock on the carriage door, seeing a young family inside. The woman saw my scarred face and screamed. “Please! Help me!” I cried. The man blinked and gaped as the woman pulled a small boy close. Over my shoulder, I glimpsed Jacque Denue and his friends charging toward me. I hurried past the coach and down the next alley. A rock sailed past me, missing my head and striking a wine barrel. 138 “Hey, now, stop that, you boys!” the driver called from behind. But he remained in his high seat as the boys’ feet skittered across the cobbled path. I rushed down the next busy street. “Help!” I called, to anyone who would listen. “Help me!” They all backed away, startled by my manner and my appearance. Men, women, children, all dressed well, all strong and healthy, stepped clear of me. Clearing a path for the boys to chase after me, shouting their threats. “We’re coming for you, Scars!” Jacque sang. “We’re gonna kill you!” one of his friends shouted. I ducked into another alley and glanced over my shoulder. The boys grinned like demons, sprinting after me with rocks in their fists. Ahead of me, the alley was bricked in. I gasped and turned, searching for a way out. I grabbed onto an upper ledge and tried to scale the wall. But my skirt made it impossible. “Trapped like a rat,” Denue said. His gang filled the mouth of the alley. “More like a scar-faced pig, I’d say,” Slob chimed in. Denue tossed a rock up and down in his palm. “This’ll help you remember to keep your ugly face out of our village, Scars.” He hurled it at me. I ducked and it struck the brick wall. Muscles threw another one. I dodged and jumped behind a wine barrel. I sat with my back to it, like a child hiding in a cellar. 139 “Come on out, Scars,” Denue demanded. “Come get your punishment.” Their footsteps strolled closer, taking their time. They threw another rock at the wall to frighten me. Which meant they had gathered enough of them to waste a few. My breath came in rapid gasps. I suddenly remembered the black wolf looming over me, mocking me. Knowing I could do nothing to stop it. Until Francois charged in with his ax and struck it dead. Shove your fear aside, Papa’s voice reminded me, the day I made my first kill. Shove it aside and shoot. I tried not to imagine the boys’ rocks striking my gut. My head. My face. I remembered the voice of my other hero, Francois. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped, he had urged. Stand up and do something. I looked around the empty alley, at the shrapnel of rocks and bricks scattered nearby. A broken wood plank lay among them. I seized it with both hands. I rose. The boys stared with surprise and delight. Denue hurled his rock at my eyes. I slapped it away with the plank and marched at them. Marched at Denue. The others fell silent and stopped. Muscles threw another stone. I smacked it against the wall and it shattered in half. Freckles hurled another one. I slammed it to the ground. 140 “Throw it!” Denue ordered the others. “Gimme the rock, then!” Slob surrendered his stone to Denue as I closed in. He tried to throw it but I smacked his wrist with the plank. He yelped as I jammed the end of the board into his chest and drove him back out of the alley with his friends. We emerged on the open street and I whacked him across the shoulder. He fell to the ground and rolled onto his back. I dropped to my knees in front of him, releasing the plank. The others gaped as I pummeled him with my fists. I continued with single-handed blows, one after the other. Until he lay on the ground, bloody and crying. I stopped. He cringed and whimpered beneath me, shielding his face with open palms. I could have beaten him into a helpless mass, the way he beat me all those years ago. But what would be the point? I stood to my feet. “You’re not the one I want. Just keep out of my way.” I stepped over him and marched back to Monsieur Leóne’s shop. Denue called after me, half-threatening, half-sobbing. “You freak! You’ll regret this, you scar-faced witch! You’ll regret this!” I ignored him. He was flesh and blood, like me. Beneath his savage surface, he was as frightened as the rest of us. I wanted the wolves. I returned to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and the post where I had left Crimson. He 141 snorted and stamped his feet until I released him and stroked his neck. The fire in his eye matched my own. If he had been free to fight, those boys could never have chased me. “I don’t think I’ll tie you up again, friend.” Crimson snorted. I think he understood. 142 15. Something disturbed my senses as I rode through the woods near our cottage. Something in the air. When we emerged from the forest, I understood. All of our sheep lay strewn about our meadow, turned on their sides, unmoving. A gentle breeze from our yard had carried the stench of their drying blood. I urged Crimson forward and he charged toward the house. The front door stood open, as if gaping in shock. No sheep were bleating, and a 143 glance told me that a few of them had likely run off, or been carried away. Those that remained lay in puddles of blood. Valiant lay beside them in his own scarlet stream. My crossbow was already out and loaded for our trip through the woods. I held it high as I leaped down from the saddle. In my hurry, my foot caught in the stirrup and I stumbled to the ground beside the carving table. I scrambled to my feet and ran inside. Pots and pans, clothing and half-cooked food, were scattered everywhere and stained with blood. Mama’s rocking chair lay in splintered fragments on the floor to my left. I smelled Mama’s stew bubbling in its pot on the cast-iron stove. I let it boil. Wind whistled through the house from the half-open rear door. Against the doorframe, a thick smear of blood was spread like tar. My throat went dry. On the floor beneath lay a large shred of Mama’s dress. I ran to it, clutched the fabric to my chest. I raised the crossbow high and kicked the back door open. Splotches of blood formed a trail from the rear stoop, across the grass behind the cottage, continuing toward the stable. Crimson cantered around the cottage to meet me, drawn by the noise at the back door. He noted my intensity and looked to one side, perhaps wondering what I was tracking. He sniffed at the blood and snorted, 144 sounding angry. I followed the scarlet trail to the stable entrance and hurried inside. The mess was everywhere. The walls, the posts, the hay, the troughs. All matted with thick blood. Most of it had collected in Royale’s stall. I moved toward it slowly, trembling. Within the stall, Royale’s saddle lay on its side. Strands of hay stuck to the blood that coated it. Beyond the stall, the rest of my mother’s dress lay in a sickening pile of straw and dark blood. Crimson stood back and stamped his hooves. My legs felt like melting wax as I stepped closer. I found her jewelry and one of her shoes. Nothing more. She had been taken naked, along with Papa’s horse. They had taken everything from us. Everything. Beside Mama’s abandoned dress lay a hand. A tiny skeletal hand. I fell to my knees before it. My crossbow fell to the hay. It landed on something soft and red, but it didn’t sink through the way it would have sunk into straw. I reached into the inky blood that coated the fabric and lifted it slowly. The blood clung to it and wouldn’t let go. It was her blanket. Her fuzzy woolie. I felt the moan gathering in my gut before it reached my throat and became a wail. Suzette. “Celeste! Suzette!” It was Father Vestille’s voice, calling from somewhere near the front of the cottage. I considered calling out to him from the stable. To come find my family’s remains. 145 My mouth would only whimper. Father Vestille’s feet kicked up a flurry of dust as he skidded into the stable. He gaped at me as I knelt beside Royale’s stall, next to the dress and my sister’s hand, holding her bloody blanket. He stood at the entrance beside Crimson, his chest heaving. “Helena. What – happened?” I didn’t answer. He knew what happened. Anyone seeing this would know. But just like Father Vestille, no one would admit to knowing. A wolf howled nearby. Dark rage surged through me and lifted me to my feet. I snatched up Papa’s crossbow and ran past Father Vestille. “Helena, wait!” He ran after me with Crimson trotting along behind. At the edge of the forest, barely hidden among the trees, a wolf stood. Stood. I had not imagined it. The monster stood on its hind legs, even now, and grinned. Mocking me from the woods. I lunged toward it. Father Vestille tackled me and pinned me to the ground. “Helena, no!” He held me down with his full weight, pressing me into the dirt. I strained to rise. To strike at the beast. To fire a bolt into its belly and turn that smile into a grimace of agony. I finally pushed Father Vestille off and rolled aside. I ran at the wolf as it turned to lope away. I heard it laugh as it fled – actually laugh – in a sort of whooping cackle. 146 I charged at the spot where it had stood. I squinted for a sign of its vanishing tail while Father Vestille chased after me. “Stop, Helena, stop!” Crimson galloped from behind me and clomped to a halt, blocking my path. Doing what Father Vestille could not do. Stopping me from rushing straight to my own death. Father Vestille soon reached us. Crimson snorted at me and I stood there, struggling to control my rage. To focus it. Father Vestille wheezed and bent over, his hands on his knees. He wasn’t used to sprinting. “Helena, please,” he gasped. “There’s nothing – you can do.” I stared through tree after dark tree, tracing the wolf’s likely path. “Not yet.” He hung his head. “Helena –.” “You saw it, Father. It stood.” “Stood?” he wheezed. “What, the wolf? No, Helena, no. It must have – must have simply appeared that way – from a distance.” Swallowing, he gathered his breath and straightened. “Helena. We’ll – We can clean up – your cottage. I’ll help – restore it.” He sounded as though he meant to convince himself as much as to console me. “There’s nothing to restore. They took my home. They’ve taken everything.” His eyes narrowed. “Who has taken everything?” “The wolves.” 147 He said nothing at first. He simply stood there, slowing his breathing, studying me. “Helena. You have a home. With me. I’ll stay here if you wish. Or you can come to my hovel. I’ll see to all your needs.” My breath came evenly as I watched the empty woods. The dark forest of wolves that had swallowed up Mama and Suzette. I had to stay angry to keep from screaming. “That’s very kind of you. But I’ll see to my own needs.” The wind whistled between us. “I know you can fend for yourself, Helena. But we all have needs besides food and shelter. Your father and – your mother – they were my closest friends, since before you were born. And you and Suzette …” His voice caught in his throat. “Helena, your family meant everything to me. I will not abandon you. Nor will I let you abandon yourself.” I stood like a statue before the woods. As a child, I always saw Father Vestille as a source of assurance and comfort. But there was no comfort here at the forest’s edge. I scanned its endless blackness for signs of movement. Any signs of the wolf or its companions. Nothing. I turned from it and strode to Crimson, climbing onto his back. I snapped at the reins and galloped past Father Vestille without a word. I returned to the village and rode straight to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. When I threw the 148 door open, Pierre seemed delighted to see me twice in the same day. Then his face fell. “Red? What’s wrong?” “Can I sleep here tonight?” “Of course, Red. We’ll make some room for you in the loft. What happened?” I tried to speak clearly. My voice rattled. “There was an attack. On – our cottage. Mama and Suzette – They’re gone.” The color drained from his face. “Suzette? How –? What happened?” “The wolves. They took my – The wolves took them. They’re gone. Can I sleep here tonight?” “Yes. Sure, I said you could. Just – sit over here. Did anyone else see it?” I walked to the stool he offered, brushed sawdust from it, and sat. Like a horse being led to its stable, without thought or will or emotion. “Father Vestille was there. He’s – He’s been helping out, looking in on us more often, since Papa died. He wants me to stay with him.” Pierre waited for more. “But you don’t want to. Why not?” I pressed my lips tight, feeling my blood boil again. “Red, what is it? Why are you so mad at him?” “Because he did nothing!” I burst. “Grand’Mere died and he did nothing. Francois died and he did nothing. Papa died and he couldn’t stop the wolf, couldn’t even find it. And now –!” I 149 couldn’t speak their names again. Couldn’t say again that I had lost everyone. Even Suzette. “But – he’s trying to –.” “Please, Pierre. Don’t tell me what he’s trying to do. Please don’t tell me people are trying to help, or that the King will send soldiers, or that everything will be all right, because it won’t. Nothing is going to be all right, ever again.” “Red …” I fell into his arms and clung to him. I needed someone who could understand and let me lean against him and cry. Someone who wouldn’t look down on me for my weakness or my irresponsibility or my ugliness. Someone who would let me cry, and never reveal it to anyone if I asked him. I buried my wet cheeks against his chest and sobbed in gulps, craving his comfort. He held me until I finished, then gently released me as I pulled away. He gave me a crooked smile and offered me a rag, beating some sawdust from it. I took it gratefully and wiped my eyes and nose. “This never happened.” He wrinkled his brow. “The hug?” “No. The crying.” “… Why?” “I don’t want anyone to know. And I don’t want to remember.” “Everyone cries, Red.” “I’ve cried enough. I’m through crying.” He narrowed his eyes, not sure what to make of me. “Listen, Red. I’ll let Papa know you’re here and tell him what happened. You’re 150 welcome to stay. I’ll make up the cot for you upstairs and get some blankets so you can rest.” I nodded obediently, feeling numb. As if all the emotion had been drained from my soul. At least, all the emotion I could reveal. My rage, my fear, the storm building inside me – I had to keep these reined in, lest they be fully unleashed. “Let me just add some more wood,” he said, stepping to the large center furnace and grabbing a poker to pull open its grate. A blast of light and heat emitted from within. “You sure you need more fire in there?” I asked dully. He grinned at me over his shoulder. “It’s supposed to storm tonight. Never know when you might need some extra heat.” He chucked a couple of logs into the opening, letting the mighty blaze roar at us before he shut the grate again. He lit a lantern and strode past it to the ladder at the rear of the shop. I followed him up to the loft with wooden movements. We emerged through the square opening. Pierre’s lantern lit the long-forgotten room in a dusty haze. Cobwebs connected the enormous wardrobe on the far wall to a standing mirror, covered in a dusty film. Near the shuttered window stood a cot. I longed to collapse onto it and sleep for hours, as Pierre suggested. My mind and strength were spent. He set the lantern on the nightstand and clomped to the wardrobe, his boots leaving footprints in the floorboard dust as I sneezed twice. 151 He opened the double doors, peeling cobweb strings apart, and bent to lift two thick blankets from a bottom shelf. Among the coats and dresses that hung above the blankets, something flashed a brilliant red. I stepped to the wardrobe and pushed the other garments aside. Behind coats, nightshirts and tunics, covered with dust and age, hung a long red hooded cloak. Just like the one Grand’Mere Marie made for me when I was little. The cloak I was forbidden to wear after the attack. I pulled it out. “That was Mama’s,” Pierre said. I kept staring at it. “Sorry,” I mumbled. “No, it’s all right. It’s beautiful, I know. Like the one you used to – uh, here. You should be warm enough with these.” The hood and cloak looked roomy, slightly too large for me. But they would fit. “I want this.” Pierre turned to me. “Huh? Oh. Sure, I’ll ask Papa. No one’s using it, so it shouldn’t be –.” “I want this,” I repeated. “I’ll give you anything you want for it.” “Red, you can have it. But you should get some rest.” I couldn’t take my eyes off the cloak. The red hooded cloak. I had not worn anything red since before I started hunting. Since the wolves took all peace and happiness from our lives. Now they had taken our lives, too. Grand’Mere and Francois and my parents. Even Suzette. For the first time, I had known some of the joy my mother 152 always wanted for me. To feel like a mother, or at least a big sister. And they had taken it away. I clutched the cloak to my chest. Then I moved to the cot. “I’ll use this as well. To keep warm.” “All right,” Pierre allowed. I sat on the cot. “Father Vestille will plan a service for my mother and – my sister. Can you find out the time and have someone wake me?” “Of course.” I clutched the cloak in my fist and admired it once more. “I’ll wear this to the service.” Pierre frowned. “We might have a black veil you can use. I don’t think you can wear red for a funeral.” I flashed on him. “Don’t tell me what to wear.” He studied me, then shrugged: “Red it is,” he said. “Get some sleep.” I lay down, wrapped the red cloak around myself and pulled the blankets up as Pierre returned to the ladder. I sat up. “Pierre?” His head poked up through the square opening. “Thank you,” I said. He smiled and gave a nod, then descended through the hole. I blew out the candle and the room sank into darkness. 153 16. Where are you going, little girl? I saw myself walking through the woods and tensed. The same woods I traveled as a child. I was on my way to Grand’Mere Marie’s house again, carrying a basket of bread and cheese. But I was myself, sixteen years old. I knew I was having a nightmare, but I couldn’t wake up. “Where are you going, little girl?” a gruff voice repeated from the forest. 154 I peered through black trees, thick as a fortress gate. A pair of low eyes studied me. The creature came slowly between the trunks, a thick shadow of black fur and pointed ears. Eyes shone from the shadow, a pale bluish-gray. The large wolf came into view, still lingering behind a few trees. I stepped backward, my heart racing. “Don’t be afraid,” it said. “… You’re a wolf.” The shadow nodded. It seemed to grin. “Wolves don’t talk.” I clutched the basket to my chest and took another step back. As if I could disappear within the folds of my cloak. “I do,” it said. “Where are you going, little girl?” A chilling breeze tickled my cheeks. My voice was barely a breath. “To my Grand’Mere’s house.” “And where does she live?” “… just over the hill, past the three oaks.” My eyes locked on the furry shadow as my fingers locked around the basket’s handle. “I’ve never seen a wolf like you.” “No?” Its voice was sheer mockery. I shook my head. I wanted to run, to scream. But my legs stiffened in place like a terrified fawn. The wolf stood taller than me, as it had appeared when I was only seven. Its head was half the size of my body. “You have – such big eyes. And ears. And such big teeth.” His fangs spread with pleasure. “The better to see and hear you with, Mademoiselle.” 155 I heard my breath flowing in and out. In and out. “… And your teeth?” It leaned toward me. It kept leaning in as it padded closer, closer. “The better to eat you!” I clutched the basket and raised it to protect my face. To hide my eyes from its open, dripping mouth. A sharp crack sounded over the hill. It was Grand’Mere’s neighbor, Francois, splitting wood with his ax. He would hear if I screamed. The wolf regarded me casually. “We’ll meet again, Mademoiselle. Soon. But keep silent about our first meeting.” It raised its paw to its pursed lips, as if signaling me to be quiet. The way a human would. “Now run to your Grand’Mere’s. Before she starts to worry.” The wolf turned and loped away. Beyond it, the eyes of six other wolves shone in the distance. Watching and waiting. I backed away carefully as they remained in their positions like sentinels. I hurried off through the trees. As I ran, I noticed the first wolf nearby, keeping pace with me. Its enormous black figure loped gently at first. Then it bounded through the woods, leaving me far behind. It was headed to Grand’Mere’s. I gasped and ran harder. About ten minutes later, I finally reached her cottage and threw open the door. Inside, on Grand’Mere’s bed, the wolf circled about her sheets and nightgown, smeared with her blood. It turned toward me and smiled. 156 It jumped down from the bed, padding toward me. I had rushed too far into the cottage to retreat in time. I ran behind Grand’Mere’s rocking chair to shield myself. The black wolf stood on its hind legs and knocked the chair aside like a toy. It loomed over me, eyes shining, and spread its claws. I jumped back from it. Its claws still connected, cutting into the tender flesh of my forehead and cheeks. I spun and fell back. My own blood flew about my head. Then it dripped into a scarlet pool on Grand’Mere’s wooden floor where I fell. The open wound burned like fire. I screamed but I couldn’t hear myself. Couldn’t think of anything but the wolf as it dropped to all fours. The monster prowled closer, its open mouth salivating. Something kicked open the front door. Francois Revelier burst in, carrying his ax in two fists like a hammer of judgment. He rushed at the giant wolf and raised his weapon. Its silver edge caught the sunlight from the door and flashed with blinding light. He brought the heavy blade down as the beast charged, striking its shoulder and knocking it to the floor. The wound trickled blood as the wolf struggled to rise. Then it stumbled, confused, and fell. Fell to the floor and didn’t move. Francois squinted at it, looking perplexed. The wolf’s vacant eyes no longer blinked. Francois set his jaw and stomped forward. He lopped off the monster’s head with one clean stroke. The wolf lay there in its own blood, still 157 and horrible and harmless, while Francois stood over it like David over the head of the slain Goliath. In that instant, I learned that heroes existed. People who would risk their own lives to save mine. People like Francois. Something growled from outside. At each window, the head of another large wolf eyed us. The same wolves that studied me from the forest. Francois turned as they burst through the openings. They leaped on top of him and bit into his back, his shoulders, his arms. Francois dropped his ax and screamed as he sank to his knees beneath the bloodthirsty pile. Then the head of the first wolf – the one Francois has slain – turned again to smile at me. Then – impossibly – its head slid back to its body to rejoin its neck, re-forming itself. It stood on its hind legs again and grinned at me in triumph. Then it joined the others feeding on Francois as he flailed his arms and shrieked. I jerked upright in bed and whirled about in the blackness, trying to focus. I relaxed my neck and shoulders in the dark room. On the cot in the loft above the blacksmith’s shop, where Pierre let me sleep. I was alone. No beasts or monsters. Only me and my scars. I lay back down and drew the red cloak back around myself. The cloak that belonged to Pierre’s mother, before she died. I pulled the blankets up to my shoulders and lay there on the warm cot, wide-eyed and shivering. 158 17. “Red?’ Pierre’s head popped up through the hole in the loft floor. I pulled the dress up in front of my bare shoulders and gasped. He spotted me standing in nothing but my linen chemise, before I covered myself with his mother’s cream-white gown. He immediately lowered his gaze. “Uh, sorry, Red. I just – I noticed you lit the candle and you were up, so – Just wanted to let you know Father Vestille’s 159 preparing for burial. People are already heading to the church.” “All right,” I said, still clutching the dress. “My clothes were covered in blood. I hope you don’t mind me borrowing one of your mother’s gowns.” He cleared his throat. “Yeah. Sure. No problem.” I waited. “I’m just dressing now.” “Right. Yeah. Of course. I’ll just, uh – wait down in the shop.” “Yes, you will.”",

      "content": "“Yes, I will,” he repeated, and was gone. I waited to hear him descend the last step of the wooden ladder before I lowered my hands. I resumed dressing in his mother’s satin gown. It was the only suitable outfit that wasn’t tattered with age. A full-length mirror stood beside the wardrobe. The dress would work, though it seemed more suited for a ball than a funeral. I donned her red cloak and tied it about my neck. “Let me know when you’re ready, all right, Red?” Pierre called from below. I stared at my reflection. At the red cloak around my head and shoulders. The bright color I had been forbidden to wear for nine years. Ever since the wolves began to rule my life and the lives of everyone around me. Wearing this cloak gave me a surge of energy inside, a sense of strength I had never known, even when hunting. 160 “Yes, Pierre,” I called back. “I’m ready now.” “Here she is,” Pierre said, waving a hand toward Madame Leóne as he gently guided me toward her with his hand on my back. Madame Leóne bent forward in her elegant homemade gown, spun of midnight blue silk with an embroidered bodice. The exquisite sort of dress Mama might have made for me, if I were wearing it for someone else’s funeral. She clutched me to herself as we stood outside la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu. “I’m so sorry, dear,” she said, cradling me. I remained rigid, ashamed that I could not return her tender hug. All of my emotions had been burned to ashes, leaving me empty. I kept still and silent as a harsh wind began to whip at our skirts, warning of the approaching storm. She finally broke off the embrace, as cautiously as she had started it, and offered a weak smile. She struggled to clear her throat. “That’s – such a beautiful cloak, Helena. Your mother would have loved to see you in it.” Monsieur Leóne emerged, holding open the door for us. “He’s about to start, Lisette,” he said in a subdued tone. “We should – .” He gaped at me. At my bright red cloak. “… Brianna …” he muttered. Madame Leóne turned sharply to him. “Oh, dear. Is that – ?” She glanced back at me, her eyes 161 wide. “I had no idea. But – it’s so beautiful, isn’t it, Frayne?” Monsieur Leóne continued to stare at me, not moving. “No one’s really – using it, Papa,” Pierre broke in slowly. “And Helena’s old enough to wear it. I just thought – .” Monsieur Leóne held up a hand, stopping him. “It’s fine,” he said. “Yes, she – she looks lovely. So sorry it’s – being worn for such a sad occasion.” He swallowed. “You’re welcome to the cloak, Helena. I believe – perhaps it’s right for you to have it.” He turned aside, staring at the dirt. Then regained his composure. “Come along. It’s – time to get things started.” “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” I sat quiet and still in the pew beside Pierre inside the church, watching Father Vestille prepare to give the eulogy and pray over the bodies of Mama and Suzette. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The caskets were closed. Nearly thirty people had assembled to pay honor to my family’s memory. As always, Duke Laurent’s presence in the second row gave the service added a significant prestige. His advisor, Monsieur Simonet, sat beside him, his usual frown now seeming appropriate. Father Vestille hung his head, slow to begin. Finally, he lifted his eyes, grimaced, and 162 spoke in a hoarse voice. “My friends …” He cleared his throat and started again. “My friends. Thank you for coming. We are here to lay to rest – the bodies of Celeste Basque and – her youngest daughter, Suzette Basque. Both brutally attacked by beasts earlier this morning.” He paused, closing his eyes. Gathering his breath. “Our hearts cannot be heavier. My heart cannot be heavier. To lose such a wonderful woman and her innocent child. The Basque family has been like my own family. They welcomed me into this community and into their home. Their kindness, their openness and hospitality, inspired me to be more open to others. To find ways to reach out and welcome neighbors and strangers, the way they welcomed me.” Father Vestille observed the silent coffins. He looked so sad, so defeated, as if he might struggle to lift his head. His voice choked. “Celeste and Suzette Basque have become – even closer to me these last few months, since – since Henri Basque died. He was also – He was also cruelly taken by a wolf. Their eldest daughter, Helena, is still with us. And I urge all of you to do whatever you can, anything you can, to show her support and comfort in this time of great loss. It’s more than anyone, especially a young girl like Helena, should be forced to bear.” I felt the eyes of others staring at me. Even Pierre glanced at me. To see my reaction. I ignored all of them, staring back at Father Vestille in stony silence. Memorizing each hollow word. 163 He stood a little taller, finding more of his voice. “But we must encourage ourselves, not only in the face of death, but in life. In all that we face, even in the midst of the most horrible tragedy, we must seek the face of the Lord and draw strength from him to continue with every task of daily life. With every disappointment, every grief, every threat –.” I rose from my seat. Father Vestille stopped. Covering the cream dress, I still wore the red cloak, which had drawn several curious stares when we entered the church. But no one dared criticize what I had chosen to wear for the burial of my remaining family. And no one would interfere with me now as I stepped toward the caskets. I stopped in front of the smaller one and stared down at it. I turned to Father Vestille. “Open it.” His skin paled like a phantom. “Helena. I – I know how horrible this is for you, but –.” “Open it.” He stood frozen behind the pulpit, with no idea how to respond. The rest of the crowd kept silent in their seats. I walked behind the wooden coffin. Peeling my hood back, I lifted the lid. Inside, a few pieces of Suzette’s body had been carefully laid. Each one stripped clean of the majority of decaying flesh and dried blood. I marveled at how quickly Father Vestille had gathered and prepared them. Each piece had been neatly arranged, the hand and partial skull and 164 ribcage exactly where they should be. Except that the lower part of the ribcage was a pile of fractured sticks. This was not my sister. Only her bones. My sister’s soul had ascended and I would not see her again until my own death. All that remained of her was this pile of lifeless flesh, which would never smile again, never run again, never laugh again. I faced the spectators. Neighbors, cousins, and friends I had not seen for months. I couldn’t even remember some of their names. Pierre and his parents, Duke Laurent and even Simonet, stared at me in shock, almost fear. I lifted Suzette’s skeletal hand up high, to show everyone it was no longer connected to her tiny wrist. Women squealed and nestled against their husbands, while mothers shielded their children’s eyes. I no longer cared. I met their stares, glaring back at them. I held the hand higher. “This … will end.” I laid the hand gently back in its place with the rest of my sister’s useless parts. Then I slammed the coffin lid down, letting it echo through the sanctuary. I secured my hood once more and marched past the stunned crowd toward the rear oak doors. Ignoring Father Vestille as he gaped from the front. Past Duke Laurent, Papa’s old friend, who seemed ready to stand and comfort or dissuade me, but wisely held his place. Past Pierre, wrinkling his brow with worry, as his parents looked on with stunned faces. 165 I pushed the double doors open and strode to Crimson, who snorted eagerly beside Pierre’s horse. I climbed onto his back and he lifted his hooves, as if sensing my urgency. We galloped off into the darkening afternoon as a storm threatened on the horizon. 166 18. I rode back to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and found the spare key beneath the stone near the front stoop, where I knew Monsieur Leóne kept it. I unlocked the shop’s front door and went inside, wondering if I might ruin the late Madame Leóne’s satin gown just by walking through the warm oily air. I didn’t climb up to the loft to rest or gather my thoughts. Instead, I lit a few candles and started rummaging through the shop. I had decided on my 167 next course of action. I just needed to work out the details. I was still gathering bolts and knives when I heard fast hooves approaching. I continued working as I recognized Diamond’s whinny from out front before Pierre burst through the door. “Red! Red, what are you doing?” “Preparing for a hunt.” I continued to pace the tables and shelves, selecting weapons. “I need your help, Pierre. I need a pair of boots.” “Boots?” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “What for? If you need slippers or sandals –.” “No. I’m going hunting and I need boots to get through the mud.” He remained confused. “I know you can hunt, but … boots? I mean –.” He shook his head, as if unable to speak. “What?” “Well – You’re a girl.” We stared at one another in silence. “I am aware of that. I need the boots, nevertheless.” “We don’t even sell boots.” “I know.” I bit my lip. “I was hoping you might have an extra pair I can borrow.” “Yeah. I guess. I have some old boots I meant to pass on to someone. They might fit you, if you really need them.” “Thank you.” He remained confused. “Still seems awfully odd for a girl.” I took another deep breath. “I also need a pair of trousers.” 168 He stared blankly at me. “I realize I’m still a girl,” I said. He studied the cold stone floor. “You’re going after those wolves, aren’t you?” I said nothing. The wind outside gave a shrill whistle. “Red, those things could kill you. We can get some men together and –.” “No, we can’t. Because none of them will go.” Pierre swallowed. “Then I’ll go with you.” “No, you won’t.” “Why not?” “Because.” I struggled for an answer. I would welcome anyone’s help to hunt those beasts. Anyone but Pierre. “Because if anything happens to me, I need you to tell the others what I’ve done. Apart from that, I’m binding you to secrecy.” “What? But, Red –!” “Promise me. Promise you won’t tell anyone. If they know, they’ll try to stop me, the same way you are. If they stop me, no one else will hunt them. Then more people will be killed and it will never stop. Promise me.” All the color drained from his face, leaving him a helpless phantom. “… all right. I promise.” “Thank you, Pierre.” He looked about the shop. “If you won’t change your mind, at least let me supply you with some good weapons.” “I’ve already started.” He studied my pile of knives and ammunition. “That’s a good start, but you’ll need 169 more. If you’re right, these are no ordinary wolves. You’ll need extraordinary weapons. Too bad you can’t have your own set of claws, to even it up.” I lifted my father’s crossbow. “This should help, at least.” “Yeah,” Pierre said, studying the crossbow with a curious look. He continued to eye it carefully as he spoke. “I’ve actually been working on something for you. I meant to surprise you with it, but – guess I’d better give it to you now. I also designed some tools people could use to guard their homes, with all these attacks.” He shook his head. “Never thought I’d be giving them all to you, but – Let me find those boots, and, uh – a pair of extra trousers.” “Where are you getting those?” “… from my wardrobe.” I swallowed, sharing his discomfort. “… thank you.” He nodded and stepped away. “Let me get you some gloves, too. Should come in handy out there. I’ll be right back.” He dimmed the candles, lit a lantern and headed toward his room at the rear of the shop. For a moment, I felt warmer inside, knowing Pierre would give me all the protection he could. In the upper room a few minutes later, I untied my red hood and let it fall to the bed, then removed my cream dress. I donned Pierre’s ivory tunic and deerskin trousers, feeling perverse. I had 170 not worn pants since I was seven, when I had to borrow clothes from Doctor Renoire’s son. I wondered what my parents would think if they could see me tonight. Mama would grieve and abandon all hope that I would ever become a sophisticated woman. Papa might share her concern, but feel a sense of pride that I was doing what I had to do. What someone had to do. As I thought of them, I stifled a half-choking sob. But I had vowed to stop crying. It felt strange, preparing to go out in public with folds of cloth surrounding my legs. At the same time, I felt freedom to move, back and forth, twisting and turning, with no skirt getting in the way. I tied the cloak about my neck and stood, moving my toes about in the boots, getting used to the feel of them. I stepped back a few quick paces, then forth again, then spun about. My cloak twirled after me, threatening to catch against me the way my skirt used to. But there was little comparison. I had to be careful how I moved, to avoid wrapping my shoulders tightly into the cloak, but I wouldn’t fall over myself or tangle my legs together the way I might in a dress. And I needed the cloak to feel less exposed. I smiled. In this outfit, I could run and leap without holding back. I could climb or descend a hill fast, and quickly position myself to launch a bolt in any direction. Most important, I could fight. I could dodge or strike someone without fear of stumbling or appearing unladylike. I caught my reflection in the mirror and my heart sank. 171 I looked like a man. Not even a handsome man, but a pretentious dandy with blonde locks. Scarred and disfigured by some accident, now trying to compensate for it by dressing in a flowing silk shirt, cuffed leather boots and an oversized red cloak. I looked horrendous. I took a deep breath and released it. What did it matter how I looked? I had lived with my ugly scars for nine years. What did it matter if I looked even worse? I kept staring at myself – at the strange person in the mirror – and wondered what would become of me, if I even survived this night. Would anyone mourn the strange scarred girl from the sheep farm outside the village? But if I didn’t go, who would even be left to mourn? Those beasts would return, again and again. Picking us off one by one until they had eaten their fill. They had to be stopped. They had to be killed. I donned the hood. It shaded my eyes and made me look fearsome. Otherwise, I felt naked with my legs uncovered. But there was nothing I could do about it. I left the dress in the wardrobe, my legs exposed for all the world to see. I prepared to venture into the forest, looking like an animal. I descended the ladder. I heard Pierre scraping metal against metal, sharpening something, as I clomped onto the wood floor and stepped past the furnace to face him. He gasped. “Helena. You look –.” “Even less attractive, I know.” “Uh, no. Just, uh – just different.” 172 “How I look doesn’t matter. What matters is how well I can move, and I can move more freely in this.” “Uh – All right.” He continued to stare at me. At my legs in particular. “Are you sure you want to – go out like that?” “Are you sure you can’t stop staring?” I was glad the long cloak covered me from the rear or he might have had fits. “Sorry. It’s just odd to see you – I mean – for you to wear trousers.” I drew the cloak around myself a little, knowing how bizarre I looked. “Why should it matter? You’ve seen other men in trousers.” “Well, that’s a little different. I mean – they’re men.” He finally shook his head, like a dog shaking himself dry, and tore his eyes away from my legs. He returned his attention to the table, where he had arranged a couple of slim daggers he had sharpened, several bolts, and a rope and hook beside a pair of leather gloves. “I’ve been working on some things here to give you some extra help.” He demonstrated the various tools, including an impressive grappling hook for scaling a wall or a cliff face. Its prongs flicked out when he slid a metal catch open with his thumb. With each new device, I found myself more enchanted by his cleverness. Finally, he held up a crossbow, crowned with something that resembled a long snuff box. “What’s that?” 173 “Chinese repeating crossbow,” he said with pride. “I read about it and figured out how to build one. You load the top slot here –.” He dropped in ten bolts, one at a time. “Then you just keep pulling back on this top lever. Every time you pull back, it fires another bolt.” I almost yanked it from him. Then stared at the priceless treasure in my hands. “Pierre. This is – incredible. Thank you.” He shrugged. “Anything I can do to help. I figure, this way, you can fire again if you miss the first time.” I raised an eyebrow at him. “I won’t miss.” “All right, but – if you need to shoot again, you can fire right away.” I studied the crossbow up and down. It was pure genius. “This is perfect, Pierre. Two shots to make sure I kill it. With enough bolts to shoot down four more before I reload.” “Four – four more?” I squinted at him, wondering why he seemed surprised. “Wolves hunt in packs, Pierre. You know that. There were at least four that attacked Francois.” “Yeah, but I didn’t think – I mean, you can’t hunt them all down at once.” “I can try.” I tugged Pierre’s thick leather gloves on, then gathered my father’s crossbow and a handful of bolts. I slung the strap of Pierre’s repeating crossbow over my shoulder and grabbed tucked a few knives into a sheath, placing them in a leather pouch with the bolts, to hang from Crimson’s saddle. 174 I strode into the brisk evening with Pierre fast on my heels. Crimson turned sharply at the opening door, eager to be off. “Red, you’ll be careful, right? Promise you’ll watch yourself.” “I’ll watch myself.” I hooked the repeating crossbow onto the saddle, along with Papa’s crossbow and the ammunition pouch, then hoisted myself up. “With that red hood, they’ll see you coming a mile away.” I knew he was right. But I refused to live another day in fear. And this hooded cloak was the only thing bolstering my confidence to survive the night. “I want them to see me coming,” I said. He narrowed his eyes. “… What?” My blood surged. Crimson stamped his hooves, perhaps feeling the same fire. “I want to make them afraid, the way they made us afraid. Whatever those things are, I want them to know one of us is fighting back.” Pierre gaped, as if uncertain what to think. “Red, what are you going to do?” I set my jaw like stone. “Something.” I spurred Crimson forth. He snorted and charged ahead. Lightning stabbed at the horizon as Pierre called after me. I saw Father Vestille on his Palomino, trotting toward L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. We met with surprised eyes and I fumbled with the reins, nearly making Crimson stumble before he galloped past. Father Vestille tugged his horse to a halt and struggled to turn about. 175 “Helena! Helena, come back!” he called. I can only imagine how he would react to the bare trousers beneath my flapping cloak. I might be cast out of the church. It no longer mattered. I still had faith, but I had lost all patience. If he put me out of the church for trying to save our province, so be it. The cries of Pierre and Father Vestille echoed behind me, farther and farther away as I galloped through the darkening streets. 176 177 178 MY DISCOVERY 179 180 19. Rain started to drizzle as I arrived at La Maison de Touraine, but it didn’t dampen the wild revelry within its walls. I could see why Mama often referred to taverns as “dens”. The crowd inside rumbled like a pack of growling beasts. I had never set foot in this place except for the banquet to honor Francois, the night he died. But La Maison was a center for local gossip. The perfect starting place to learn what anyone knew about the wolves. Someone must have heard rumors or witnessed recent attacks. 181 An alcoholic stench filled the misty air. I wished for a safer way to seek information. My parents would have preferred that I forget this place altogether. But Francois had told me to seek out his friend if I ever needed help. As we trotted toward the hitching post, two men on the front porch stopped their conversation and stared. At the red horse and its red-cloaked rider. The short man’s mouth hung open. I wondered how much I resembled the Apocalyptic horseman that brought a plague of war. Though I doubted this squat man or his liquor bottle spent much time listening to the Scriptures. “Evening, Monsieur,” he greeted. I said nothing as I swung off Crimson’s flank to plant both boots together on the ground. I had no business with this man and his tone seemed more demanding than friendly. “I said, ‘Evening,’” Squat repeated. He and his slim mustached companion stepped between me and the entrance. “Evening,” I muttered. The mustached man squinted at me. He grabbed at my shoulder and spun me to face him. I looked up in his astonished face. “Why, she’s a girl!” he sputtered. “What sort of game do you think you’re playing, Mademoiselle?” Squat demanded. “This ain’t no place for someone like you.” I swallowed down fear and anger. I had no time for this. “I’ll see for myself and let you know,” I said. 182 I started forward. Moustache moved to block me. Behind me, Crimson grumbled and shifted uneasily, while Squat took another swig of his bottle. “You should listen to your betters, Mademoiselle,” Moustache said. “If you want some drinks, I’ll show you where to find some. More private, away from all these gawkers.” Crimson snorted, ready to charge him. “Step aside, Monsieurs,” I warned. Squat chuckled and glanced at Moustache, who laughed along. “Now, now, Mademoiselle. You didn’t say, ‘please’.” I pulled my crossbow from beneath my cloak and aimed its bolt-end directly beneath Squat’s jowls. They stopped laughing abruptly as my other hand settled on the lever. “Please.” Squat nodded, slow and careful, backing away to let me pass. I lowered the crossbow, measuring their reactions. Satisfied that they would not bother me further, I concealed it beneath my cloak once more. “Would you look after my horse while I’m inside? He sometimes gets agitated around strangers.” Squat and Moustache turned to Crimson, who glared back with eyes that seemed to spit flame. “Yeah,” Moustache said dully. “Sure.” “Why, thank you,” I said. Moustache took a step toward me and Crimson stamped his hoof. Both men spread their arms as they backed up to the wall. Crimson would have no trouble with them. 183 I moved to the oak doors and pushed inside. Into a room of noise and smoke and wild laughter. Where men dressed formally but acted foolishly, and a handful of women moved from table to table, dressed even less modestly than I was, serving drinks and letting men gawk at them from every angle. At the bar counter, separated from the chaos surrounding him, stood a plump man with thinning auburn hair. He talked with two men there as he busied himself polishing a wooden mug. The man I had come to see. The tavern owner, Gerard Touraine. I strode toward the counter, noting the quiet that came in my wake. Like the ripples of a swan wading through a polluted stream. Everyone seemed dumbstruck at the sight of me. Including the men at the counter who watched me approach. For a moment, none of them spoke. “That’s quite a cloak, Monsieur,” said Touraine, wiping the mug in his hand. He turned to put it away and grab a new one from the pegs on the wall. I didn’t know if he had meant that as a compliment. I assumed not. “Thank you.” Touraine stopped and turned on his heel. He took a step toward me and crouched to peer at my mouth beneath the hood. “Eh – are you lost, Mademoiselle?” he asked with a chuckle. Then his face fell. “Wait. You’re that little girl, from Francois’ party. With the, eh –.” His hand rose to make a gesture at his face. He stopped himself before making reference to my 184 scars. I appreciated that. “Francois saved my life,” I said. “He was a good friend of mine.” “Yes,” Touraine said. He cleared his throat. “Mine, too.” One of the other men laughed. “What’s this, Gerard? Your niece paying you a visit? Or is it someone else, eh?” He nudged his friend on the next wooden stool and both men chuckled. Touraine ignored them, focusing on me. “Uh – I’m afraid women aren’t allowed in here, Mademoiselle.” I glanced at the tall brunette leaning over a table of men with her hands on her hips. “She is a woman.” “Of course, but she’s – eh –.” “She has a point, Gerard,” the other man insisted. “That is definitely a woman over there. So it stands to reason, if this mademoiselle insists upon –.” “Enough,” Touraine said, silencing him. “She’s made a mistake. She came to the wrong place, nothing more.” I climbed up onto the stool across from him. I had never sat in such a high chair. But then, I started wearing trousers before today, either. “All I want is a drink.” Touraine shook his head, his brown eyes apologizing. “I couldn’t serve you.” “Oh, come now, Gerard.” The man fished out some coins to toss on the counter. “Here, Mademoiselle. I’ll buy you one.” 185 “Move on,” Touraine ordered the men. “I’ll handle this. Find yourselves a table. We’ll talk later.” The second man held up his hands. “We’re only teasing her, Gerard. Don’t get excited.” Touraine leaned toward them suddenly, almost menacing. “Find a table,” he repeated. The men climbed awkwardly down from their stools and walked away, staring over their shoulders at Touraine as he watched them go. “I only want water,” I said. “Can you serve me that?” Touraine paused to consider, then turned to grab a fresh mug. “I am also curious,” I said as he filled it. “You’re curious?” he asked, amused. “You enter a tavern with that huge cloak and you’re curious. Very well. What are you curious about, Mademoiselle?” “Wolves.” His wrist twitched, then continued to fill the mug. He set it on the counter before me, his head down. He looked up. “Wolves in general?” “Wolves in particular. A large wolf that killed a little girl near here.” “Heard about that. Tragic.” “She was my sister.” Touraine buried his heavy gaze in the floor. “… Very sorry, Mademoiselle.” “I’m curious about that wolf. A lot of people pass through here. Have you heard anything about it?” 186 He narrowed his eyes, looking confused. “Why should I tell you if I did?” “Tell me tonight and you’ll know why tomorrow.” He stepped around the counter. “I think someone should see you home, Mademoiselle.” “I have no home,” I said. The sudden rise in my voice stopped him cold. “The wolves took it from me.” “Well, what about your parents?” My shoulders trembled as I thought of Mama and Papa and Suzette. I stiffened to hide it. “… The wolves took everything.” He swallowed. “I’m so sorry, Mademoiselle. I am. But I don’t see how I can help you.” “You can’t tell me what you know about the wolves that killed my mother and father and little sister? That keep killing off more and more people in the village? I only want to know what they are, what they might be doing.” “Look. I understand you’re hurting. But whatever killed your parents and your sister is dangerous. Probably more dangerous than you can imagine. It’s no business of mine and certainly no business of yours. And I don’t think you want me to hear of another young girl’s death tomorrow. Do you?” “But you have heard things. Haven’t you?” He started to say something. Then chewed on his lip. “I think they’re the same wolves that killed Francois,” I prodded. 187 “Francois was a good man,” he said, his lip protruding in a sideways pout. “A very good man.” “He was too late to save my Grand’Mere from the wolf, but he saved me. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. He was my hero. He still is. He’s the one who sent me to you.” Touraine shot a look at me and narrowed his eyes. “How’s that?” “He said if I ever needed to know anything about anything in the village or beyond, you would be the one to ask.” That was not quite true. Francois had told me to seek Touraine out if I got in real trouble. But this qualified. I needed help and Touraine was the one who could give it. I pressed on. “He also said people need to stand up and do something to help others. Or there would be more killings. More children suffering. He said we can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s right, because some things are worth fighting for.” Touraine lifted his chin. “Francois said that?” I stiffened my jaw. “Yes.” He stared hard at me. Then relaxed. “Yeah, that sounds like something Francois would say. Good man.” “But he’s gone now,” I said, leaning forward on the stool. “He’s dead. A pack of wolves broke into his home and killed him.” Touraine nodded. “I know.” “You also know something about those wolves. I’m a good hunter. If you tell me, I can 188 stop some of them, at least. If you don’t, they’ll keep killing.” He still hesitated, but seemed intrigued. Almost believing me. “Please.” He studied me another moment. Then he resumed his position behind the counter and leaned over it. “If I don’t tell you, I expect you’ll find out from someone else. Won’t you?” I nodded. “All right, Mademoiselle. Don’t ask anyone but me. Understand? You want to know anything, or if something is true, you come straight to me, no one else.” “I will,” I promised. I meant it. This was exactly what I wanted. Touraine glanced from one side of the bar to the other. Then he began to polish a new mug as he spoke in a low murmur. “I don’t know much, Mademoiselle. Some men come in here regularly, and they seem to know something about those wolves. Always eager for news about them, just like you. Always asking for details about recent attacks. It’s odd. They seem delighted by it, like someone’s telling a joke. Lately they’ve been asking about Monsieur Favreau’s farm.” “Monsieur Favreau?” “Pig farmer on the other side of the hill, west end of the forest. Lost four of his fattest pigs to a wolf over the last two weeks. He’s worried he’ll lose the rest, though he’s got plenty to spare, if you ask me.” “When did he lose them?” 189 Touraine rubbed his stubbly chin. “One was two nights ago, the other two nights before that.” He narrowed his eyes and blinked with sudden realization. “Seems it’s been every two nights since it took the first one. Following a pattern.” “Which continues tonight,” I said, finishing the thought that was surely brewing in his mind. I rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle, your drink.” I retrieved the mug. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” I downed the water in one long swallow and returned the mug before heading to the door. “Mademoiselle?” I turned at the door. He looked helpless as a child. “I trust – you have someone to look after you?” “Yes,” I said, stepping out into the storm. “I am.” I let the door thud behind me. 190 20. Favreau’s farm was easy enough to find. I just followed the smell. Even in the rain, the distinctive odor of pig manure spread for a mile. Smoke rose from a thin chimney above the farmer’s spacious cabin, set in a broad clearing surrounded by dense forest. A long narrow pigpen sat beside it, the large pigs kicking up mud and manure as the silvery moon rose above the trees. To the left of the pen sat a small and well-kept stable, large enough to keep two or more horses. 191 Monsieur Favreau would have his eyes and ears pricked for any intruders. He must have noticed the same pattern of attack by now, how the wolf seized one of his pigs every other night. Tonight he could expect to lose another one. I climbed down from the saddle and led Crimson carefully around the perimeter. He moved so cautiously, I don’t think he broke a single twig. Hidden from the cabin windows by the horse stable, I crept toward it, leading Crimson. As we came around the corner, Monsieur Favreau’s black horse started in alarm, stamping and neighing. I quickly found the feedbag, hanging from a hook on the wall, and grabbed a handful of oats. I opened my hand for the horse to see and sniff. He calmed immediately and let me approach so he could nibble from my hand. I shared some with his companion, who had just woken, then grabbed more oats to feed them again. Once they relaxed, I brought Crimson into the stable to stand between their twin stalls. I scanned the clearing. Nothing moved in the dark woods around the farm, though the drizzle made it difficult to be certain. I hoped that any wolves would have equal trouble spotting me. Dim light issued from within the house. Monsieur Favreau must have lit a lantern to keep a late vigil over his property. I grabbed more oats and prepared to lay the pile in my skirt. Then I remembered I was no longer wearing one. I stuffed them in my pants pockets instead, wishing I could store more. I 192 reminded myself that the trousers still gave me the best advantage. I crouched and crept toward the pen. A few pigs squealed upon seeing me approach in my sweeping cloak. I scattered a few oats at them, and they returned to their agitated pacing. Farmer Favreau wasn’t the only one anxious about the wolves tonight. I crawled carefully between the wooden bars of their pen. The pigs backed away and huddled against one another, but they no longer cried out. They gradually spread apart to move freely about the pen once more, though they kept an eye on me, snorting little warnings as they passed by. I crouched in the filthy mud and slop and waited, forcing my senses to adapt to the intolerable smell. At least the rain would wash away some of the manure from my clothes, once I left the pen. But that would be a long time in coming. I would keep vigil until the wolf arrived. I felt the crossbow at my hip. Not my father’s, but Pierre’s Chinese repeating crossbow. As brave as I made myself appear to everyone else, I couldn’t afford to miss or waste time reloading. I sat for over twenty minutes. By then, the pigs seemed to regard me as part of their pen – a piece of scenery to walk around as they continued their nervous pacing. Nearly half of them had fallen asleep. The others seemed as tense as I was. I finally sat in the slop. My knees and thighs were tired, and I no longer cared how I looked or smelled, or what I had to scrub off the 193 cloak later. In any case, this almost guaranteed that the Leóne family would not ask for it back. I leaned against the gate post, turning my head now and then to check for anything approaching from behind the farmhouse. It felt good to finally rest. Nervous as I was, my shoulders and head felt heavy. I closed my eyes and thought of Suzette. Sweet, pure Suzette. Playing among the white daffodils in our meadow, running from me and laughing, her golden hair streaming in the biting wind. I saw her run toward the dark forest. Beyond the first line of trees, the woods were black as coal. Except for the eyes. More than a dozen pairs of eyes, shining from the darkness. “Suzette, stop!” Papa called from behind me. “Come back!” “Suzette, no! Suzette!” Mama screamed. Suzette continued to laugh and run in an irregular pattern, playing a game of escaping me, escaping us all, while the eyes watched from the forest. “Suzette, turn around!” It was Francois Revelier shouting, beckoning her back. Suzette wouldn’t listen. “Helena, go after her!” Papa told me. “Bring her back!” I stood where I was. I watched Suzette, laughing and playing as she drew closer to the forest. “Go, Helena!” Mama urged. “You can get her! Bring her back!” 194 “But the wolves …” I muttered. I felt a tremor through my skin, like a spider crawling up my spine. “You can bring her back, Helena,” Francois said. “You’re the only one who can do it.” Suzette giggled and dodged back and forth, closer and closer to the forest. To the waiting eyes that had grown in number, nearly twenty of them now. “But they’ll kill me, too …” “Helena,” Mama said in a quiet voice. “Helena, please …” “You can do it, Helena,” Papa said. “Bring her back. Bring her back.” A tear flowed down my cheek. “I can’t …” Suzette’s laughter echoed from the forest’s edge. “Can’t catch me!” Then she turned and ran straight into the dark abyss, where teeth flashed open beneath each pair of eyes. “Papa?” I started suddenly. Soft rain fell on my cheeks and I rankled at the damp odor of pig manure. The tiny voice came from the front porch. A little freckled girl stood there in her nightgown, staring out into the dark clearing. I looked and saw a heavyset man standing between puddles, holding a musket. Farmer Favreau, no doubt, watching for the wolves. I had dozed off. Never even noticed him leaving the house. As he surveyed the outer perimeter of trees, I craned my neck, letting the rain needle down on me. Moonlight shone between 195 rolling clouds, directly overhead. I had slept nearly an hour. I looked back at Favreau as his gun whirled in my direction. Its barrel aimed squarely at my hooded forehead. I sat frozen in the mud and darkness. The bearded Favreau stood rigid, squinting through rain at the pigpen. Watching for any movement, listening for any strange sounds. I made none. He finally relented and turned slowly back to the trees, while rain pelted the surrounding leaves. I felt my heart start beating again. “Lucille, go back to bed,” he called over his shoulder, still watching the forest. “I’m not sleepy, Papa,” the girl complained, rubbing her eyes. I estimated her to be four years old. A year younger than Suzette, but just as lively, just as playful. Just as innocent. “Get back inside,” I muttered in a violent whisper. “Into bed,” he repeated. “Your mother wouldn’t have wanted you out in this cold, God rest her soul. Now go on.” I swallowed. He was a widower, raising little Lucille on his own. Just the two of them. “Papa, what’re you doing? Did you hear the wolf?” I felt my breath through my teeth. I alternated between my study of the trees and of the light from Favreau’s house, shining on little Lucille’s white gown. “Get back inside,” I murmured again. 196 “I heard something,” Favreau said over his shoulder. “Might be that wolf, so go on inside, like I told you.” “Yes, Papa,” she said. The rising irritation in his voice finally convinced her. My shoulders relaxed. “Look, Papa! There it is!” Blood flooded my temples as I sat higher. Lucille was right. Striding forth from the forest was a gray wolf – taller and larger than a normal wolf. It grinned, showing no fear of the musket. Perhaps it had never seen one. Or simply didn’t fear it. The rain fell harder as I raised Pierre’s crossbow. If the wolf didn’t fear a bullet, it certainly wouldn’t fear a bolt. Until I sank enough of them into its belly. At least, that’s what I hoped. It padded through the muddy field toward Favreau. As if daring him to shoot. “Get inside, Lucille,” Favreau ordered. “Kill it, Papa. Kill it before it takes another pig!” “Inside, I said!” Favreau couldn’t escort his daughter to safety and face down the wolf at the same time. He leaned his head to one side and sighted the animal patiently. Letting it draw closer into range, he waited for the right shot and pulled the trigger. A beautiful shot, right to its face. It sent the beast spinning backward to the slippery ground, dead. 197 Favreau lifted his head as Lucille jumped up and down on the porch, her fists raised in victory. “You did it, Papa, you did it!” The clearing fell quiet. The creature was dead. It was over. I was never even needed. I felt relieved and strangely cheated. But I couldn’t help but feel grateful over the huge wolf carcass lying still on the soaked grass. Then four more wolves padded into the clearing. They emerged at once, from four different positions, like an organized battalion. Grinning, they marched at Monsieur Favreau like soldiers, each as large as the first one. 198 21. Favreau stood gaping at the gathering wolves, his fingers loosening and tightening on his gun. The wolves moved closer, ignoring their fallen companion as the mounting rain pelted his carcass. “Papa, there’s more of them!” “… get back inside,” he said quietly. He started to back away slowly. The wolves picked up their pace. 199 Favreau continued to back up. He lifted his musket to a firing position, but abandoned the effort as the wolves kept coming, kept grinning. They weren’t rushing at the pigs, or even at Favreau. They focused their attention beyond him, at the porch. At Lucille. My head pounded with terror. They had planned this, waited for this opportunity. They stole a pig every couple of nights to draw the family out into the open, until they found an opportunity to attack Favreau’s daughter. Then they all emerged at once, the same way they must have attacked Francois at his home. Favreau would never get Lucille inside before the beasts devoured them both. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and sliced into the side of a pig. It squealed and ran to the other side of the pen. The wolves jerked toward the commotion as the pigs began to rush back and forth, thumping and sliding against one another. I cut into another one, encouraging their panic. Two wolves sniffed the air, perhaps smelling the flow of animal blood. I rose, my cloak billowing up from my shoulders as I brandished the crossbow. The wolves gaped along with Favreau and his daughter as I rushed between the pigs to the gate. I kicked up at the top bar to flip it open, flinging rainwater. The pigs spilled out of the pen, slipping and stumbling as they darted back and forth across the clearing. 200 The wolves continued to stare as I marched out of the pen and fired at the nearest brown beast, piercing its chest. It fell to the ground hard. The others snarled and charged, struggling for traction. “Get inside,” I ordered Favreau. “Who are you?” “Get inside!” I stepped sideways, angling to face the next wolf as it approached. The others closed in, eyeing me warily. I pulled back twice on the crossbow’s lever, firing one bolt into the first animal’s gut, the other into its paw. My racing pulse had thrown off my aim, but I had wounded it. Enough that it stayed down. I moved in a curving path between the pigs as they skidded across the muddy grass. The remaining wolves circled around me, craning to peer over the herd for a path to get at me. Between the wild flurry of pigs and the misty haze, I couldn’t tell whether there were two or three wolves closing in. They ignored Favreau and his daughter as he scuttled her into the house and shut the door. That was all that mattered. The wolves bared their teeth, dripping with saliva. I registered three of them surrounding me, a gray one to my left, brown to my right, and black behind me. The rain had played tricks on my eyes. What seemed like a perfect hit on the second wolf must have only grazed him. Two of them charged, one from each side. The gray one leaped at me as I whirled to launch a bolt into its stomach. It spun and rolled aside, howling, while I dropped backward to the ground, 201 planting my elbows in the mud. I kicked at a pig as it scurried in front of me, thrusting it at the attacking brown wolf. The startled pig knocked it several feet away, stopping it for a second. Long enough for me to roll to one side and fire a bolt into his companion behind me. Then to fire two more into the brown wolf as it bore down on me, dropping it to the puddle-soaked field. I scrambled to my feet. Three bolts left. The gray wolf rose to its feet, staggering a moment before it turned to lunge. I fired once, keeping my final bolts in reserve. It spun to the ground as the black wolf struggled to all fours and sprang at me. Another bolt finished it as the gray wolf reared back to lunge again. I tugged on the lever, sinking my last bolt into its heart. It fell in a heap and lay still. I stood in the quiet. Chest heaving in the drizzling rain. Waiting for my pulse and heartbeat to slow while the remaining pigs squealed and ran in circles through the clearing. My hands shook. I took deep breaths, ordering my arms and shoulders to relax. I reached into my pouch for another round of bolts and started loading them into the top slot, one by one, in case there were more of them. … More of them … I turned back to the clearing, where the first gray wolf had fallen. The grass there was matted down a little, where the animal had lain. But the wolf was now gone. The rain wasn’t playing tricks on my eyes. Four wolves had come from the forest, but after I 202 struck down the first one, four wolves remained. Only one of the wolves was gray. The first wolf, the one Favreau shot with his musket. It had risen to join the others and attack me again. The wolf nearest to me – the one I shot four times – groaned and rolled to its side. Then it rose and shook its head to recover. I watched, crossbow ready, as it studied its wounded paw, from which a bolt still protruded. Two similar bolts remained embedded in its stomach. It lifted the paw to its teeth, bit hard on the bolt, and tugged, nearly dislodging it. Then the creature set its paw down and reached for the bolt with its other paw. I gaped as it wrapped its claws around the bolt to seize a firm hold – the way a human would – and pulled it out. It dropped the bloody bolt to the ground and regarded me, while I blinked at the impossible feat. Crimson whinnied from his hiding place in the stable. He burst into the clearing, pounding toward me at full gallop. I grabbed onto his saddle as the wolf’s jaws opened to chomp at my legs. Crimson whisked me away and raced into the woods, as I clung to him with one foot in the stirrup. Behind me, three other wolves rose in similar fashion, grinning and showing little signs of the battle. Crimson knew when to run. 203 22. Crimson thundered through the misting rain over twigs and pine needles, as I hung precariously alongside. Pressing hard into the stirrup, I grabbed the saddle’s horn and tugged myself onto his back to settle onto him. I crouched low against his neck as he galloped through the black woods, leaving Favreau’s drenched farm behind. My fingers ached from their grip around the repeating crossbow but I refused to let go of it, despite how little it had helped me. What were these creatures that looked 204 like wolves, but withstood bullets and pulled metal bolts from their paws? Clinging to Crimson, I glanced back at the monsters chasing us. Up ahead, more pairs of red and yellow eyes leered from the darkness. I tugged at the reins and Crimson skidded to a halt, twisting to one side. Three wolves strolled out from behind tree trunks, cutting off our exit while the others closed in from behind. I tugged Crimson to the right. Two more pairs of eyes blazed in the distance. The wolves that owned them padded into the spreading moonlight. I continued circling. Another wolf loped toward us from the opposite direction. We were dead. I swallowed and drew Pierre’s crossbow. If I sank enough bolts into one of them – just one of them – it might bring him down. It was the best I could do. I was about to die, like my family. Like Francois. I would never know love. Never have children. Never see Pierre or Father Vestille or Monsieur Laurent or anyone else again. And no one in the village would know that I had died in a foolish attempt to save them. But I could still honor Suzette, if I could kill one of these monsters. Just one. The wolves blocking our escape stood ready to attack, yet they restrained themselves. I turned about to face the wolves that had chased us from the farm. Their gray leader strode toward me, his three companions following close behind. I choked back a sob. Why did I have to die? A young girl, scarred and helpless and stupid 205 enough to fight these creatures because I knew that someone needed to. Why should I die while these beasts lived to kill again? I had six bolts. It was all that could load before the wolves rose to chase me. I fired the first one. It sank into the gray wolf’s chest, throwing him backward in a tumble. The others waited as it lay on the ground. Then it rolled back to its feet, the bolt protruding from its shoulder. One of his companions padded over to him and yanked the bolt out with its teeth. Then they marched forward. I fired another. I struck him in the same place, close to his shoulder wound, hoping to weaken it. Surely their blood couldn’t flow fast enough to heal the same damaged spot. The wolf rolled backward, grunting against the pain of the blow. Then it rose to its feet again, letting another wolf tear the bolt out. They continued to advance on me as an organized mob. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I fired a third bolt. It gleamed in the moonlight as it flew, striking the wolf in the center of his skull. The animal tipped backward and its eyes rolled in a look of surprise. It spun onto its back and lay on the ground. It did not move. The forest fell quiet. The other wolves gaped at it. Not with anger or fear, but a look of actual shock. They turned toward me and I shuddered. I raised the crossbow with its pitiful three bolts 206 remaining. As I wondered how it would feel to be torn apart and eaten. Instead of attacking, the pack stared at me with wide eyes, as if frightened. Or awestruck. They backed away. I turned Crimson to face the two wolves behind me, expecting them to pounce. But at my sudden turn, they skittered backward. So did the wolves on either side. I turned Crimson again to face them, measuring their reactions. They turned and ran off in all directions, howling and scrambling as if I had set them on fire. The leader’s carcass remained still on the damp ground. Rain dripped like a drum from the tree leaves, as I felt the wild pounding of my heart. Crimson shuffled his hooves in the mud, looking from one side of the dark forest to the other as though he shared my relief and confusion. One bolt – one single bolt – had killed this beast, when every other one failed. What sort of monsters were these? I waited for a few seconds. Resting in the quiet and calm and the cooling breeze from the dissipating rain. I dismounted and touched down carefully on the ground, as though I expected it to swallow me up. But nothing happened. No wolves returned. The gray wolf leader didn’t rise to attack. Its mouth hung open with no breath, no movement. The beast was dead as a fallen log. As any wolf should be after being shot seven times. But why didn’t the first six bolts kill it? Why only the seventh? And why only this wolf? 207 I recalled the wolves from the clearing. This first one entered and was shot by Monsieur Favreau. Four more joined it, and this gray wolf rose up to attack alongside them. But only four of them followed us from the farm. I grabbed hold of the bolt lodged in the wolf’s forehead and pulled. I pressed my boot heel over its open eye and tugged, but it wouldn’t budge. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and cut into the forehead around the bolt, sawing until I made a wide bloody hole. The quieting rain turned the fresh blood even fouler. I swallowed back the bile rising in my throat and spat on the ground. I seized the bolt with both fists, pressed my boot against the animal’s face and yanked hard. The bolt came free all at once. I fell onto my rump holding the shaft, its end covered with blood and bits of bone and flesh. I shut my eyes and quieted my soul a moment. Then I stared at the mess of flesh and fur matted with blood. Underneath it, the bolt looked the same as every other one. What made it so powerful? I stood and shoved it into the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle. He flinched slightly. His stomach seemed stronger than mine, but not much stronger. I mounted and returned to the Favreau farm. I drove Crimson hard, but he needed little encouragement. He seemed just as eager to escape the forest and find shelter before the wolves returned. Favreau’s farm was the last place I wanted to be, but we had to go back. 208 It took little over a minute to reach the clearing. A dim lantern still burned within the house. Favreau might be watching us from inside or rocking his daughter back to sleep, or both. Near the house, a single brown wolf lay still, unmoving. Dead. We trotted up to it and I swung down from the saddle, landing on both feet. I ran to the carcass and rolled it onto its back. Two bolts stuck out from its belly. But blood surrounded only one bolt, in the animal’s stomach. The other bolt yielded no blood, even though it had struck the wolf’s heart. I pressed my boot against its pelt and tugged the bolt free. It pulled far more easily than the one from the gray wolf’s skull. I stared at the bloodstained bolt in the moonlight, turning it back and forth in my fist. I shot and killed this wolf the same way I had killed the gray wolf. Why did these two die when the rest of the wolves survived every attack? Something howled in the distance. Crimson and I whirled toward the forest. I shoved the bolt into the pouch with the other one and hurled myself onto Crimson’s back. We fled, leaving the large wolf carcass for Favreau to clean up in the morning, if he ever chose to leave his house again. I had to find out how Pierre forged these two bolts. And I had to live long enough to do it. 209 23. We charged through the forest, pounding over twigs and pine needles as the rain turned to mist. Back to the village and to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne, the only home I had now. How long it would remain a home, I couldn’t know. But Pierre and his parents had to let me stay at least one more night! Another howl rang through the trees, closer than the first. The wolves had picked up our scent. Crimson thundered ahead without any prodding. My sides ached from the jarring ride, but 210 I refused to restrain him. Not with so much forest to cover. The howling increased, from two or more wolves. They could be organizing themselves, picking out a trail, searching for us. They would find us in minutes. Well before we reached the village. A growing chorus of howls rose as we raced on, sweating in the fresh humidity. They would surround us again, in greater numbers. This time, they would not hold back. “Helena? Helena!” I gasped. Had someone called me? I wished it was possible, this deep into the forest. I tugged on Crimson’s reins for a moment. “Helena! Helena, is that you?” I froze in the saddle. Crimson stamped his hooves, eager to flee. I scanned the area, searching between black trees. A horse approached from the fog, its rider bearing a lantern. The trotting silhouette took on a dark shape, lightening as it drew closer. Beneath the wide-brimmed hat, Father Vestille’s eyes held a look of horror. “Helena! Helena, what’s happened? Are you all right?” I couldn’t answer as he came toward us, appearing from nowhere. I was too exhausted to think. “Helena, what’s wrong? I’ve been searching everywhere for you.” The wolves howled again, less than half a mile away. I jerked at the sound. 211 Father Vestille studied the woods behind us. “You went after them, didn’t you? The wolves.” I said nothing. He turned sharply at another shrill howl. “They’re closing in. Come. My hovel is nearby.” He turned and took Crimson’s reins, leading us away at a fast trot. I said nothing, did nothing to resist. The battle and blood and terror left me numb and aching. I only wanted to sleep. To sleep without dreams or nightmares. We continued through the woods at a steady pace. Father Vestille focused on the muddy path, seeming to ignore the wolves’ terrible howls. We entered the little clearing where his house stood, a sturdy structure of clay and large stones, small but protected. For the first time since my childhood, the sight of Father Vestille’s hovel warmed my heart. A place to lie down and rest, where the wolves could not break in. I was so intent on returning to Monsieur Leóne’s shop that I had never considered retreating to Father Vestille’s home. Of course, I would never have accepted his invitation tonight if I wasn’t so desperate. He led us to his stable behind the cottage and jumped down from his saddle. He looked about, then led his Palomino into its stall, closed the gate and moved to the pile of hay beside it. I sat atop Crimson, heart pounding, chest heaving. The wolves would find this stable any moment. But I waited, my mind and body numb. Waited for Father Vestille to hurry! 212 Even if I hid in the stone house, the wolves would pass by here soon and catch Crimson’s scent. My throat went dry as I imagined them feeding on his flanks while I drifted off to sleep in the warm cottage. We couldn’t stay here. We would have to race on to the village and take our slim chances. Father Vestille set down his lantern and grabbed a pitchfork from the wall. Then he started to rake and pitch hay aside in a mad rush. I froze, exhausted and horrified at his sudden desire to clean. His own fear had driven him mad. He cleared the hay in front of the stalls and set the pitchfork back in place. Two narrow wooden doors, over twelve feet across, had been built into the floor. I blinked. “What is that?” He glanced about once more, then pulled up on the ropes attached to each door handle. Hay and dust fell from them, making my nose twitch. I waved it away and squinted at the wooden ramp extending beneath them. It led deep into the earth below Father Vestille’s hovel. He retrieved his lantern and beckoned us forward. Crimson took a cautious step, then permitted Father Vestille to lead him by his reins down the broad ramp. I expected to duck my head as we descended, but found that even Crimson could stand upright on the ramp and in the long musty room below. A dust-laden cot stood in a cobwebbed corner, opposite some wooden crates of ammunition and gunpowder in the far corner. 213 “The man who sold me this property was a retired soldier,” Father Vestille said in an urgent hush. “He built this underground shelter during the Spanish War, to hide supplies and weapons. I’ve since used it to hide refugees, but not since the War of the Territories.” Near the cot sat a sturdy, long forgotten rocking chair. In addition to soldiers, this place had housed families and mothers with small children. Who had Father Vestille hidden down here? Crimson snorted at something on the far right. I wrinkled my nose at the molded hay strewn across the floor, next to a hitching post built into the wall. This cellar had been designed to hide horses as well as their riders. A true shelter. Sheer genius. “I’ll clean that out of here and get some fresh hay in the morning,” Father Vestille said, setting his lantern on a table. “I’m afraid you’ll have to endure the odor for tonight. Come. Let’s get you cleaned up so you can rest.” I climbed down, but ignored Father Vestille’s offered hand. Instead, I led Crimson to the hitching post, letting Father Vestille hurry back up the ramp to pull both doors shut. He tramped back down as I removed Crimson’s saddle to let him bed down beside the old hay. He gave no argument, showing the same exhaustion I felt. I turned back to Father Vestille. He paled. “Helena, what – what happened? Who did this to you?” He wasn’t staring at the blood or patches of wolf fur or even the manure staining my clothes. 214 Only the trousers that shamelessly exposed my legs to the world. “I did,” I said weakly. “What?” He stared as though I had told him I stuck my hands into a fire. “I can’t explain right now. I just – just want to rest.” He gaped at me for a moment longer, then recovered. “Of course, of course.” He moved to the old cot and lit a candle on the table beside it. “Let me clean this off so you can lie down.” “There’s no need,” I said, dropping backward onto the mattress and sending up a cloud of old dust. I shut my eyes and shielded my nose. I couldn’t get any filthier. “Helena. We should clean you up …” “I just want … to sleep …” The wolves howled from the forest above us, their cries now faint. I opened my eyes to see Father Vestille studying the ceiling. He listened intently for a moment, then turned back to me. “All right, Helena. I’ll be back for you in the morning. Get some rest. And … tomorrow, we can talk. All right?” I didn’t answer or make any promise. I just stared back at him, tired and weak. He nodded, as if we had agreed on something, and stepped away. He left the candle burning for me, to give off a dim light. Finally safe, finally free for a few hours, I shut my eyes and descended into heavy sleep. 215 24. I awoke with a start as something pounded in the darkness. I sat up in bed and blinked, trying to distinguish shapes and remember where I was. Had I returned to Pierre’s loft? My head ached as if something was hammering my skull. The pounding continued from above. I squinted in the hazy light. The candle had burned down to a fuming spark, but dusty rays of light shone through cracks and holes in the ceiling. “Helena, are you awake?” Father Vestille’s voice was muffled. 216 “I’m –,” I started, hearing the harsh rasp of my voice. I cleared my throat and called louder. “I’m awake. You can come down.” One of the long shaft doors creaked open, shedding more light on the tiered ramp. Something surged inside me, a strange sense of hope and freedom that I couldn’t understand. Then Father Vestille’s boots descended the thin boards of the ramp, carrying a tray of food. He wore plain tan trousers and suspenders with a linen shirt. I wrinkled my brow, feeling even more like an intruder. I had rarely seen him without his priestly robe, not since I was a child. He looked tired and worried. “Good morning,” he said. He moved past Crimson, who was rousing himself from the floor, as I sat up in bed. He set the tray on a small table beside the cot. Warm bread and cheese and smoked sausage. The welcome smells nearly overcame the cellar’s musty odor. My stomach rumbled as I closed my dry mouth. Why did I suddenly feel so safe here? Not just in this secret hideaway, but under Father Vestille’s care? He pulled up a stool beside the bed, sliding it past the rocking chair. “Go ahead, Helena. I’m sure you must be famished.” I swallowed. “Thank you.” I started in, seizing the bread with a ferocity that startled me. I didn’t realize how hungry I was. How tired and sore. I felt like a wounded stray puppy Father Vestille had rescued from the forest. 217 He watched me, saying nothing. As though he wanted to make certain I ate. “Do you mind if I join you?” I chewed on one side of my mouth to answer. “Of course. It’s your food.” He smiled. Then he closed his eyes and crossed himself, mouthing a silent prayer. I stopped chewing, feeling ashamed. It never occurred to me to give thanks for the meal, as I normally would. I was too hungry. He lifted his head and opened his eyes. “I’m sorry I didn’t pray.” He shrugged. “The Lord understands. I expect you’ve had quite an ordeal.” I chewed quietly on the bread. He glanced at my legs, covered only by trousers, then looked away, embarrassed. He met my eyes. “Can you tell me what happened?” I kept chewing. He waited for me to swallow. “… It’s more than I can explain.” He frowned, studying my face. “Very well.” He took a piece of bread and sliced off an end of sausage. “I’ll bring down a wash basin for you to bathe, whenever you’re ready. Or you can bathe upstairs and I’ll wait outside.” I sat up at the thought of leaving the dingy cellar to clean up. “If – you don’t mind – yes, I would rather go upstairs.” He gave a curt nod. “I’ll show you where the sponges are. And I’ll start cleaning down here. Or I can wait outside, if you wish, and watch for any uninvited guests.” 218 I lowered my gaze, eyeing the plate of warm food. I never expected him to accommodate me so much after I ran off last night. Especially with the way I now looked. He had no idea what I had done or what monsters were chasing me. Yet he welcomed me into his home without demanding any explanation. “Thank you. But I don’t think they’ll be looking for me now.” “Hopefully not.” His eyes looked kind but wounded. “Are you all right, Helena?” I curled my lips shut. I wanted to tell someone what happened. What I had discovered about the wolves, whatever that was, exactly. I needed to learn what made those two bolts kill the wolves when the others failed. But Father Vestille was the last person I wanted to confess my activities to, let alone boast about them. “I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you for your hospitality. It’s very kind of you.” He seemed ready to say something, then shook his head slightly. “You can stay here if you wish. I’ll keep you hidden. My home will always be open to you, no matter where you go or what you do. I just want you to be safe.” “Thank you. I’ll consider that.” I hardly knew what to say. After I had rejected all of his hospitality, he still offered me a home. His home. Or at least, the secret longhouse hidden beneath it. My own underground refuge, for as long as I wanted. Somehow it seemed right to hide here. Despite its musty odor, it felt so comfortable and 219 familiar. As if I belonged here, where nothing could touch me. I studied the dusty rocking chair as Father Vestille leaned forward on the awkward stool to tear off some bread. “Who did you hide down here during the war?” He blinked in surprise. “I hid you.” I nearly choked on my bread. He leaned forward anxiously, but I held up a hand as I chewed and swallowed. “What?” “You and your parents, and your Grand’Mere. When foreigners started raiding the villages, they were hunting for soldiers. Like your father. This underground shelter was a secret that the former owner shared with me, for just such a purpose. We’ve all kept it secret ever since.” He shook his head, recalling troubled times. “Your father came home frantic, the last survivor of his regiment. Not certain whether to fight the invaders or protect your mother, who was with child – you. He decided, wisely, to protect his family. You were born down here, with your Grand’Mere serving as midwife. You all lived here nearly two years, while the invaders tried to secure territory up above. Your father snuck out at night on several occasions to wreak havoc on their equipment and supplies, then retreated back here to safety.” “Papa hid here and snuck out to battle the enemy at night?” “One successful ambush after another,” Father Vestille said. “He took great risks, but he always returned home safe to your mother, here.” Just like I did last night, I thought. 220 I stared back at the rocking chair, laden with years of dust. I tried to imagine Mama rocking an infant in it. Tried to imagine her wondering how long she would be confined to this underground prison, struggling to keep her child hidden. To keep me hidden. As she wondered if the invasion would ever end, and whether Papa would return that night, or leave her and Grand’Mere to raise me all alone. Father Vestille folded his hands over his mouth. “The invading forces never bothered me. I was only a priest, submitting to their rule. So I could keep you all safe.” He lowered his gaze. “That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. Your parents invited me here from Burgundy, and let me stay with them until I could find a place of my own. This place. I owe them a great deal.” I felt cobwebs lifting from my memories. “I remember a wide door opening in the ceiling,” I said. “I remember sunlight pouring in.” He smiled. “We all celebrated when the King’s soldiers arrived to secure order. We were free. Free to return to our separate homes. But we kept meeting every week at your home.” Until the wolf attacks, when you decided to spend your time visiting safer provinces, I thought. Still, it was clear my family owed him a great debt. I owed him a great debt. “I never knew that,” I said. He ate his bread and sausage while I broke off a chunk of cheese. We chewed in silence. When we finally finished, he gathered up the tray and moved to a far corner of the room, where a 221 ladder stood upright near the wall. It ended at the dusty ceiling. “Let me show you where the basin and sponges are. Then I’ll get some oats for your horse and start tidying up down here.” He moved the tray to one arm and started up the ladder. I stood, amazed. “This leads up to your home?” “Of course,” he said. He pounded with one fist against the ceiling and pushed open a door. Light poured in from above. I felt the same rush of memories from childhood, feelings of instant safety and freedom. Father Vestille slid the tray up onto the floor above, then brushed away clumps of dust from the opening. “It was designed well, to hide soldiers and refugees as well as weapons. If anyone attacked, there was another means of escape. However, I figured it would be best to enter through the ramp we used last night. I didn’t want to startle you. You can eat meals with me or down here. Or you can stay somewhere else and come here if you need refuge. Whatever you choose.” He ascended the ladder and stepped out of sight. I hesitated to follow him. He had invited me into his home many times, but I had never looked or smelled so foul. With my strange and wanton appearance, I expected him to deny he even knew me. I rose from the cot, feeling stiff pain throughout my body, especially my ankles and lower back. I didn’t realize how much last night’s ordeal took out of me until I tried to simply stand 222 up. Crimson went back to sleep on the floor. He must have felt the same exhaustion, or perhaps more. I climbed the ladder, stepping gingerly on bruises and blisters that stung the soles of my feet. I clutched the rung and grit my teeth. If I planned to continue this crusade, my body would have to adapt. The door in the ceiling opened onto a corner of Father Vestille’s front room, warm and free of dust. I breathed in clean air and felt my body relax. He had few furnishings, but they looked comfortable. Three cushioned chairs, a breakfast table, a reading table with a lantern and his Bible beside another leatherbound book, a broad round rug, some portraits of the Christ and of some friends, and a stoop leading up to the front door. The outer porch was all I had ever seen of this place. Who could imagine it hid such a refreshing home? I looked back at the wall of portraits, seeing one that looked familiar. I stepped forward and saw that it was my parents, with me as a child, only a few years old. Mama held me on her lap, unable to contain her smile. Papa sat beside her, strong and upright, lifting his stiff chin as if daring anyone to attack his family. I forced down emotions, refusing to let myself cry. Then I realized, he had no paintings of any other friends. He kept this portrait alone, alongside the portrait of the Christ. A picture of Mama and Papa and me from long ago, before I was scarred. I tightened my lips and stood taller. 223 Father Vestille noticed me staring at the portrait. “You were only four then,” he said. “That was painted by a young man who came through the village, a couple of years after the war. Your father paid to have it made and it was remarkable. He could tell I wanted it badly, but I would never ask. I still feel it should have been hanging in your home all these years, but he insisted I keep it. He told me they would see it often enough, every time they came over.” I felt a lump of shame in my throat. I had never even seen it. I turned back to the reading table, picking up the leatherbound book. “Is this a book of Latin translation or something?” He deftly extracted it from my hands, so suddenly and gracefully it felt like it had vanished into thin air. “No, this is nothing,” he said, sliding it beneath his Bible. “Just an old journal of personal notes.” I swallowed. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to be so nosy. I’ve just – I’ve never been here before.” “It’s all right, Helena. You have nothing to apologize for.” He pointed at a large oval washtub against the wall. A bucket was set beside it with a rag slung over its rim. “The washbasin is here. I’ll fetch some water to heat up and fill it for you. Should have it ready in less than an hour.” He pointed at the rear door. “My room is in the back, if you need more rest while you’re waiting.” “Father Vestille. My clothes are filthy. I can’t lie down on your bed.” 224 He didn’t look at me as he grabbed a bucket from the corner. “I can wash the bedsheets later. Right now, I’m caring for you.” “Don’t you need to know what happened? Where I went after the funeral?” He started toward the front door. “I’m sure you’ll tell me when you’re ready, if you wish to.” “Why did you ask if I went after the wolves last night?” “I heard them howling. Obviously, they were chasing you.” “But why did you hide me underground? You don’t mind me being here now. Why didn’t you take us straight into the house last night?” He stopped with the door half-open. Standing like a statue, he stared at the stoop in silence. Then he slowly closed the door and stepped down, setting the bucket on the floor. “Helena, sit down.” “I told you, I’m filthy. I can’t sit on these nice –.” “Helena, please,” he implored in a mournful tone. “I need to speak with you.” He sat in one cushioned chair. I sat in the one opposite him, struggling to ignore the mud and manure of my cloak staining its cushion. Father Vestille folded his hands and stared at the floorboards. “I hid you underground because – I thought others might be chasing you. Along with the wolves.” 225 I stared at his balding head. Wondering what secrets he held inside it. “You know something about these attacks.” He looked up, his eyes desperate and sad. “Helena. I don’t know what happened to you as a child. I don’t know what killed your parents and Suzette.” “Father Vestille, I think I –.” “— but I have my suspicions.” Blood surged through my cheeks like fire. “I’ve heard many rumors over the years. Of attacks on women and children in this area and other provinces. In Gevaudan and Dijon and several villages throughout France. Attacks by wolves.” My breath grew heavier. My heart beat harder. “And not ordinary wolves. Witnesses describe them as something larger than a wolf, but similar in appearance. The largest wolves are about five feet long, but these are more than six feet long, standing over four feet high.” I stifled an inward gasp. He was describing the size of the wolves I had fought last night. The size of the wolf that scarred me when I was seven. “People also claim that these wolves act strangely. Almost cunning in their approach, the way they avoid men and their weapons. Almost stealthy in their patience and strategy, attacking victims when they’re alone and most vulnerable. Some insist they have noticed these wolves waiting several nights for an opportunity to seize a 226 small child, the moment she ventured outside her home.” In my mind, I pictured Favreau’s farmhouse and the thinning ivory nightgown of his young daughter. I felt a shiver in my skin. “What are these creatures?” Father Vestille shook his head, looking helpless. “I have no idea. But there have been rumors of other activity in those same areas. Some people claim there is a cult that worships wolves, believing the animals to be superior to men in both power and cunning. This cult calls itself the Lycanthru.” He held my locked gaze. “Many believe the Lycanthru are responsible for these attacks.” I could hear my breath now. Feel my chest heaving up and down. “How?” He shook his head again. “I don’t know. Some say they capture wolves and practice witchcraft on them. They believe the Lycanthru have the power to transform these wolves into the creatures that attacked those women and children.” Every nerve of my body was on fire. “How do I find them?” “You don’t!” he barked. He struggled to calm himself, shaking. “Helena. I’m telling you this to help you understand. These men are practicing witches. They’re performing rituals on wolves to make them kill people.” I stifled my fear. “Like Mama and Papa? And Suzette and Francois?” He frowned. “Yes. And like you, if you keep after them. Do you understand?” 227 I stood to my feet. “Someone has to stop them, whatever they’re doing. Someone has to make this stop.” He rose with me. “But you are not that person, Helena.” “You don’t think I can face them? You’re wrong. You would know how wrong you were if you saw me last night. I killed two of them.” “Two of how many? There have been over a hundred attacks reported, just in the surrounding villages. Do you expect to hunt them all down?” He stopped himself. Then he took me by the shoulders. “Helena. I know you’ve suffered. I’ve suffered, too, though not as greatly. I lost your father and mother and your sweet sister. I don’t want to lose you, too.” I felt my cheek twitch, but I steadied my resolve. “I’ll see to it that you don’t.” “It’s not that simple, Helena.” He turned from me, wringing his hands. “What happens when they come after you? Were they chasing you when I found you?” I said nothing, but shuddered. “You’re dealing with something far more dangerous than you realize.” I bit my lip. “Maybe I am. But someone has to.” He hung his head, defeated. “I cannot tell you what to do. I can only beg you to stay away from those people. These attacks have been occurring for decades, and no one has yet found a way to stop them.” 228 I thought of the two crossbow bolts in my satchel bag, my senses on fire. “I might have found it.” He blinked and narrowed his eyes at me. “How, Helena?” “I’ll look into it further and let you know.” I knew better than to tell him anything more. He already had little faith in my abilities. What would he think of my report that two bolts had killed wolves when all of the other bolts failed, and I just needed to figure out why. “All right, Helena.” His eyebrows lifted in a shrug of surrender. He stood as if shouldering a heavy weight. “Please consider what I said. And don’t do anything foolish.” His warning had come far too late, but I said nothing. “Rest in my bed for a while. I’ll fetch water and heat the bath. You can make this your home, if you wish.” He frowned again. “You are – You’re the only one left of your family. I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Please stay safe.” I swallowed. “I will. I promise.” He nodded, pursing his lips. As though he accepted my vow but knew I wouldn’t give up my dangerous plans. He retrieved the bucket and moved to the front door, creaking it open to scan for intruders before stepping outside. I felt a strange emptiness in the silent house. Father Vestille was the last person I wanted in my life, especially now. But he might understand my loss better than anyone else. In an 229 odd way, he was the closest thing to a family I had left. I sighed, dismissing my grief. His hovel kept me warm and secure. That was all that mattered. If this Lycanthru cult was behind the attacks, they would never search for me in a priest’s home, let alone his secret underground retreat. I could no longer sleep in the loft at L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Not after attacking the wolves last night. Some villagers might expect me to seek help from Pierre, and that expectation could endanger him and his parents. I would have to avoid meeting him too often. After I returned there today, of course. 230 25. By late afternoon, I had bathed and eaten a little more. I even slept another few hours in Father Vestille’s underground retreat, which smelled much nicer once he finished his cleaning. After I woke, I cleaned and fed Crimson, who seemed to feel as fresh and alive as I did, eager to gallop again. As we pounded toward the blacksmith shop, a few villagers cast odd glances at my bright hood and burnt umber horse. They would surely 231 have gaped at my offending trousers as well, if they knew I was a girl. The odor of burning iron filled the inside of L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Pierre looked up from his smelting pot and quickly extinguished the flame, setting his tools aside. He met me with eyes full of panic. “Red! Where did you go? Where have you been all day? Father Vestille was searching for you for hours, and I’ve been –.” “He found me,” I said. “I’m –.” I stopped short, catching myself before I announced I was staying with Father Vestille. Pierre was the one person I could confide in. But to protect him and myself, I had to keep that retreat secret. From everyone. “What?” “I’m not sure where I’ll be staying now.” He looked wounded. “Red. You can stay here as long as you want.” “That’s not entirely safe. I appreciate the offer, and I may take advantage of it now and then. But your loft can’t be a permanent home. It will draw too much attention.” “From who? I don’t care what anyone in town thinks.” “Not from people in town.” “Red, what’s happened?” “I found them.” Color drained from his cheeks. “The wolves?” “And I fought them. About twelve of them.” 232 He glared at me, trembling slightly. He looked me up and down, apparently checking for cuts or missing limbs. “Are you – Are you all right? You – You got through it.” “Yes,” I said, sounding more annoyed than I should have. Pierre knew I was a better hunter than most men. But no one, man or woman, would likely survive an attack from a dozen wolves. If it weren’t for Father Vestille, I would be dead. I softened, touching his hand. “I’m fine, Pierre. Thank you for your concern, and your help. Everything you gave me.” He released an anxious sigh. “How did the blades work for you?” “Fine, Pierre,” I said. “They work just fine.” “And the new crossbow?” I lifted the repeating crossbow for him to see. “It worked perfectly. Twice. That’s why I need your help.” He took the crossbow and studied it with a quizzical expression. “It only fired twice?” “No. It fired thirteen bolts.” He blinked at me, looking even more amazed. “You missed?” Heat rose in my cheeks and I stuck my fists on my hips. “I sank every single bolt into those things.” “Oh,” he said, satisfied with the answer to one puzzle but still confounded by the remaining one. I calmed myself and realized he was complimenting me. He believed his own repeating 233 crossbow was more likely to fail than I was likely to miss. “Most of my shots would have killed a normal wolf. But these things kept coming. The bolts had no effect on them. Except for these two.” I held up the grimy bolts I had pulled from my satchel. He took them from me and squinted closely. “What’s so special about these two?” “That’s what I need you to find out. Do you make every bolt the same way?” “Yes,” he said. Then he seemed to recall something and looked a bit ashamed. “Although – the process is the same, but – we don’t always use the same material. You asked me to make you extra bolts, so I used the metal we had in supply. I had to mix in some other metal for some of them, to give you a few more.” “How many bolts did you make that way?” “Only two or three.” We gaped at one another. Tugging on his work gloves, Pierre grabbed a rag and dunked it into a steaming pot of water. He squeezed it out, then used it to wipe most of the blood and grime from each bolt. He took them to a smelting pot at the opposite end of his work table, adding some kindling to heat a flame beneath it. Then he held the bolts over it, melting them slowly. After a full minute, I watched a single drip fall into the pot. I stepped aside to sit on a bench. This would take some time. Beyond the furnace, the rear door of Pierre’s house opened. Monsieur Leóne came out, marching straight across the room. “Pierre, I need 234 you to finish those stokers for Monsieur Denue by Friday.” Pierre turned on his heel to stand at attention. “Yes, sir.” Monsieur Leóne studied his son a moment, then noticed me sitting quietly in the corner. “Helena? What are you –?” He blinked hard at my legs. I broke the silence. “I came to ask Pierre for some help. Something’s wrong with my bolts.” He seemed to be struggling for words. I crossed my legs and tried to pull the outer edges of my cloak over them. It didn’t help. He seemed just as perplexed, just as offended. “Helena …” He started to speak, wrinkled his brows some more, and shut his mouth. He tried again. “Helena, I – I’m so sorry for your loss. Your mother and Suzette, they were wonderful people.” I stared back, feeling numb. “Thank you.” He couldn’t tear his eyes away from my masculine garb. “Do you – need anything? Food or – clothes?” “No, thank you. I’m well taken care of.” He forced his mouth to close. Then at last, he turned and walked away, but stopped to address his son. “Pierre, I need to pick up some more iron. The miners finally broke through and found a rich supply, so we won’t run short again. I’ll return in two hours.” He glanced sideways at me, then turned back to Pierre. “Can you handle everything while I’m away?” “Of course, Papa.” 235 Monsieur Leóne gave a curt nod, blinked at me twice more, then left through the door to their home. Pierre looked irritated. “First time he’s ever asked me if I can handle the shop by myself. I usually do when he’s away.” “I don’t think he approves of my wardrobe,” I said flatly. Pierre shrugged. “Well – it’s a little different.” I looked away, feeling even more isolated. But I no longer cared what Monsieur Leóne thought of me. Or what anyone else thought. Pierre studied the falling drips of metal. “Nothing unusual so far. Regular iron, like we always use. Some lead, though, showing here. All right, so this one had some other metal mixed in. But I can’t see how that would matter, when – wait – all right, some copper. Traces of silver …” Blood surged through my shoulders. As though I was meant to pay attention to that detail. As though I had been given the answer. Silver. Francois said his ax blade was made of silver. His blade only grazed the wolf, but had killed it instantly. “Try the other one,” I said. He narrowed his eyes at me, confused. “I haven’t finished studying this one.” “It’s enough. Melt the other one.” He frowned, but set his tools and the first bolt aside. Within a few minutes, he found what I expected him to find. 236 “– some lead in this one, too – Some traces of silver. Must have just poured everything in at once. Nothing else yet, but –.” “It’s silver,” I said. “What?” “Silver. That’s what kills them.” “Red, that makes no sense. A silver bolt couldn’t hurt a wolf any more than an ordinary bolt.” “You should tell them that.” “But how’s that possible?” “I don’t know. But these bolts killed them, and so did Francois Revelier’s silver ax. Killed it easily, just like the two I shot last night. That must be the difference.” “Red, silver isn’t any kind of poison.” “It might be to them.” He shrugged again. “All right. How can we know for sure?” I sat rigid on the bench and stiffened my lip. “Only one way. I’ll have to start using silver bolts.” “You’re going after them again?” “Yes. But this time, I’ll be better armed.” “Red, if you’re wrong, they’ll kill you!” “They’ll kill us all, anyway,” I said hotly. “That’s what no one seems willing to grasp. They’re not going to stop. They’ll keep coming. They’ll keep getting stronger and more numerous and killing everyone they feel like killing. We can die trying to stop them or sit at home and wait for them to come. I’m not waiting.” “But – silver? That’s impossible, Red.” 237 “So are these wolves, over six feet long and able to …” He waited for me to finish. “Able to what?” I almost said they could talk and stand upright. Something I never shared with anyone outside my family, not even Pierre. At least, not after the week of the attack, after seeing the confused faces of Father Vestille and Francois when I told them what happened. I couldn’t bear to receive that same look from Pierre. “… able to organize themselves to attack in large numbers,” I finished. “They staked out that pig farmer’s house to get at his daughter.” “What makes you think that?” “There were plenty of wolves on hand last night to attack. Yet for the last two weeks, they only took one pig at a time. They didn’t care about the pigs. They only wanted to draw out the farmer and his little girl. Once she came outside, the wolves showed up in full force.” “But why would wolves attack a little girl when they could go after a whole herd of pigs?” I thought of Father Vestille’s story about the Lycanthru, practicing witchcraft on wolves. “They’re not wolves. They’re some other sort of creatures, under some kind of spell. I’ll need silver bolts. My blades and other weapons need to be silver, too. Even my grappling hook, just in case.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “We don’t have that much silver to spare, Red. How much does it take?” 238 I peered into the smelting pot at the sparse drops of melted silver. “How much was in those bolts?” “Barely a trace.” “Then that’s all I need. Just a little on the tip of each bolt and the sharp edges of each blade.” Pierre rubbed the back of his neck. “Red, suppose you’re right. Suppose this will kill them. They’re not likely to show up at that farm again. How will you even find them?” I thought of Touraine, telling me about the men who delighted in reports of wolf attacks. Men who might belong to the Lycanthru. “I have an idea where to start.” 239 26. A few hours later, after I ate some bread and pork prepared by Pierre and rested a little more in his loft, I rode toward La Maison de Touraine. Pierre had outfitted all of my weapons while I slept, gilding each new bolt and knife edge with silver. He said his father would be furious to learn he had melted down other customers’ works to make new bolts for me, putting their orders further behind. But he planned to tell him he found some imperfections and needed extra time to finish. I thanked him for it. 240 It was near nightfall. Villagers started to tug their cloaks about their shoulders as they passed by in the street. Many of them stared at me with a fresh sense of surprise. Instead of wrinkling their noses at me, they stopped in their tracks and followed my movements, almost in a sense of wonder. As though it had suddenly become admirable to wear a giant red cloak. I rode up to the hitching post at La Maison and left Crimson to stand beside it. I patted his neck. He had slept well at Father Vestille’s last night and gotten more water and oats from Pierre. He seemed fit and ready for whatever might come tonight. I pushed through the thick doors of the tavern. Raucous conversations stopped. I scanned the room. Every eye fell on me. I stood at the door, uncertain what to do. Were they staring at my scars? At the red hood? I stepped forward, listening to my own slow boot steps on the floorboards as I approached the bar counter. People began to murmur and resume their excited conversations, now strangely hushed. Were they talking about me? At the bar, Touraine wiped the counter where a man had just spilled his beer. As I drew near, the gaping man slid off his stool, filling my face with his alcohol breath. He continued to stare as he turned in a circle and backed away, forgetting the rest of his drink on the counter. “So,” Touraine said quietly. “You’ve returned.” 241 “I seem to be popular this evening.” His broad shoulders heaved and sighed. “Yes, you are. You went to Favreau’s farm last night.” It was not a question. “I might have.” “You fought five or six large wolves there, killed two of them. They found the bodies this morning.” “There were about a dozen, actually. They chased me into the –.” “You’re him, aren’t you?” interrupted a well-dressed man. His large elbow came to rest on the far end of the counter. His voice was smooth, almost mocking. “You’re that red rider. The one who fought all the wolves at that farmhouse.” I turned slowly toward him, keeping my head down, saying nothing. It seemed prudent to let him think I was a man. Even more prudent when I took a good look at him out of the corner of my eye. Tall and strong, with a broad black moustache. He held his drink at his side, grinning as if he was somehow challenging me. Not doubting me, but wanting to test my abilities. “Move along, Brocard,” Touraine said. “Those are just rumors. How could one man take on a pack of wolves by himself?” The man ignored Touraine and didn’t budge. He sipped his drink, studying me. “Those wolves. They’re dangerous, you know. You’re lucky to be alive.” His face lit up like the devil, or something worse. As if he could picture the wolves tearing me apart. “I’m Jean Paul Brocard. I farm 242 cattle and do some business in the village. I trade livestock, horses, weapons, tools. Anything a man might need.” He raised his eyebrows with an unconvincing show of friendliness. “Perhaps I could outfit you some day, Monsieur. A man who fights off a whole pack of wolves will surely need help now and again. Extra food for your horse. Extra bolts for that crossbow.” Touraine cleared his throat, looking nervous. “I really don’t think the man’s interested, Brocard.” The smiling man edged closer along the bar counter. “You might discover I’m a good man to have on your side, Monsieur. You need someone you can count on, to help you survive. When the odds are overwhelming.” He slid his drink along ahead of him, stopping it near me. He sat on the stool beside mine and leaned forward, folding his fists as he tried to look beneath my hood. “Because those wolves will come looking for you, you know. All of them. And they’ll find you. And tear you into small pieces. Who will help you then?” I stood and raised my crossbow to his face. Every conversation halted again as Brocard lifted his chin. His Adam’s apple swallowed hard. Then he smiled wider, as if to cover his anxiety. I understood, since I had drawn my crossbow in order to keep him from seeing my shoulders trembling. I focused on steadying the weapon, the way Papa had taught me to do when we were hunting, to push aside my fear. Brocard lifted his palms in gracious surrender. I allowed him to take a step back. “I see 243 it is a ‘No’ for now,” he said. “We’ll talk again another time, Monsieur.” He continued to back away, hands raised as he grinned. I turned toward the watching crowd. They all kept silent. A few of them turned away as I met their gaze. “Yes, you’re popular all right,” Touraine said. “Be glad I’m not telling anyone you’re a girl. A strange young girl at that, dressing like a man and fighting wolves in the dead of night. They’d never leave you alone.” I lowered my crossbow, concealing it beneath my cloak. “Am I really that strange?” He pursed his lips. “Have you seen a mirror lately?” “But you meet all sorts of people here. Even women. Am I actually the strangest girl you’ve ever met?” He considered for a moment. “Ever?” I nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, you are. Just watch yourself. Men like Brocard are charming enough, but he’s part of a dangerous crowd.” I resumed my place on the stool. “Dangerous, how?” “Excuse me, Monsieur.” I flinched at the gruff voice. A tall man marched straight at me. He wore the broad blue cloak of the village police. “I hear you were involved in an incident at Monsieur Favreau’s farm last night.” I kept my head down a little, hiding beneath the hood as best I could while I studied him. He looked strong and severe, with inky black 244 hair beneath his broad-brimmed hat. He squinted at me with narrow eyes. Eyes that shone blue-gray.",

      "content": "I stiffened, my blood racing through my veins. The same blue-gray eyes of the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me scarred. The same eyes of the wolf that Pierre and I met in the dark tunnel. What in God’s name did it mean? “I’m Lieutenant-General Vigo Sharrad,” he said, his words coming to me in a fog. “It’s my job to protect the people of La Rue Sauvage. And their farmland.” “I think someone’s been spreading rumors, Monsieur Sharrad,” Touraine said casually. Sharrad jutted his broad chin at Touraine, as if threatening to stretch forth and bite him. “And who’s spreading those rumors, do you think?” Touraine shrugged. “I don’t know. But I can’t imagine anyone fighting off a pack of wolves on their own. Let alone this – person wearing a bright red cloak. Can you?” “I can imagine a number of things.” Sharrad glared back at me. “I expect you’ve got a wild imagination, too, don’t you, Monsieur?” “Monsieur,” Touraine broke in again, leaning on the counter with a smile. “This gentleman’s just here for a drink. Maybe some people don’t like how he looks. Maybe they’re jealous of his cloak. So they’re making up stories about him. He hasn’t really done anything, has he?” 245 Sharrad’s eyes burned into me. I kept my head lowered, but kept watching him from the shroud of my large hood. Watching his eyes. “Not yet,” Sharrad said. “But I’ve heard reports, and I’ll be watching you, Monsieur. If I hear of any more unprovoked attacks on wolves or other animals, you’ll see me again.” “But, Monsieur,” Touraine continued. “If someone’s killed some of the wolves that are attacking people, that would be good, wouldn’t it?” Sharrad faced him with his fists on his hips. “When I need a tavern keeper to help me keep order in the village, you’ll be the first man I call on. Until then, keep quiet and bring me and my friends another round.” “Of course. Sorry, Monsieur. Be there in a moment.” Sharrad cast another glare in my direction. “You keep that crossbow put away while you’re indoors, understand?” I gave a slow deliberate nod. Sharrad regarded me another moment before striding away to his table. I shivered as I watched him go. I couldn’t have seen what I thought I did. It was impossible. But I couldn’t deny it. Those shining eyes were unforgettable. I would have to watch Lieutenant-General Sharrad closely until I could reason it out. Touraine glanced in Sharrad’s direction. “Try not to get yourself arrested. Or killed. Seems you’re making the wrong people angry. Of course, now that you’ve killed a couple of giant wolves, you probably think you can handle anything.” 246 “Tell me about those men. The ones who enjoy hearing about wolf attacks.” He nodded back at Lieutenant-General Sharrad before turning to line up several mugs on a tray. “He’s one of them. So is Brocard. They come in here with their friends every time there’s an attack. Someone from their group is usually the first to report it.” He wrinkled his brow. “Matter of fact, I never knew you used a crossbow, ‘til Brocard offered you more bolts.” “I thought Favreau told everyone that.” Touraine shook his head as he filled each mug in turn. “No one’s seen Favreau. His brothers found his stray pigs and rounded up most of them. But Favreau wouldn’t come out or let his daughter out, even when they beat on his door. Kept telling everyone to go away.” I felt an inner chill. “So how did anyone know about the wolf attack last night? How could anyone know I was there?” Touraine leaned over the counter and spoke in a lower tone. “Be careful. Someone knows what you did, and they’re spreading the word.” “Someone who was there,” I said. “Someone like Sharrad and his friends.” He seemed to consider this as he resumed filling the mugs. “Likely.” “So am I some kind of pariah now?” “Maybe. No one’s sure what to make of it. Someone attacking wolves late at night on a farm and killing two of them. Some think you’re a hero. Most of them didn’t believe you existed.” He 247 surveyed the room of hushed murmurs. “Of course, they do now.” I turned to view Sharrad and his table. The murmur of the crowd hushed as I faced them. Some men watched my every move, perhaps fearing I might draw my crossbow again. Sharrad’s cold eyes continued to focus on me. Beside him, Brocard raised his mug toward me with a smile. None of the other seven men at their table were smiling. They stared at me or looked over their shoulder, scowling and whispering at one another’s ear. They were all dressed differently, representing different jobs, different ages, different tastes. Yet they shared the same vicious scowl. I wouldn’t trust myself alone in a room with any of them. “How often are those men in here?” “Every night on the weekends,” Touraine said. “Either that crowd or some of the others.” “There are more?” “Plenty more. A few dozen, I’d expect. All different walks of life. Some farmers, some carpenters, merchants, woodcutters, coopers, blacksmiths. Some of them are very well off, some are barely managing. Not sure what they’ve all got in common. Except maybe a cruel sense of humor.” He shook his head again. “I’d stay away from them, if I were you.” I studied the surly gang across the room as they eyed me with contempt. “Yes,” I said. “That would be wise.” 248 27. It was near midnight before Sharrad and his associates left the tavern. I spied on them from a dark alley, feeling the evening’s chill, as Crimson waited behind me in quiet obedience. They seemed in good spirits now, shoving playfully at one another and making threatening growls, like rough-spirited children. Like Jacque Denue and his companions. Hairs rose on my skin. I could see what Touraine meant about avoiding these men. I didn’t 249 want to go anywhere near them. But I had to know how they were connected with the wolves. They mounted their horses and trotted off toward the woods. Brocard, still utterly pleased with himself, led the way with a lantern held aloft. I allowed them time to gain some distance, then climbed onto Crimson’s saddle and rode after them, following their distant light. About ten minutes later, Brocard and the others entered a large clearing on the outskirts of a sprawling farm. I tugged gently on Crimson’s reins, keeping us shrouded and still in the forest. The men rode ahead in full view, toward the large barn at the center of the pasture. Whoever owned this land seemed well-off. A wheat field spread for several acres beyond the grove of trees that hid the barn and silo. Yet there was no house connected with the barn, so the owner could afford to hire out farmers while he sat at home raking in profits. Sharrad and the others dismounted and glanced about, looking over their shoulders. Crimson kept perfectly still for me in the shadows. Once they were satisfied, Brocard raised his torch higher and led the way to the barn. He tugged open the front door. More torches blazed within, where several other men had gathered. I couldn’t see any particular person, only a small crowd. As a few of the men led their horses around back, Brocard and the others went inside, casting 250 final glances over their shoulders before they shut the door. Something felt wrong, unsettling me like a snake burrowing under my skin. I prodded Crimson forward by cautious steps into the shadowy grove, surveying the grounds to make sure no other men approached. A noise rose within the barn, like a unified cheer, or a collective moan from a herd of beasts. Crimson slowed his pace, and I couldn’t blame him. I felt a crawling chill in the air. Like something small and devilish laughing in the wind. We edged forward to the side of the barn. I dismounted and drew Crimson to stand close to the wall. The din inside grew louder and clearly human, almost musical in its unison. I crept to the front door and searched for a discreet way to enter. Up above, beams of light broke through the wall, revealing the loading entrance for stockpiling hay. I withdrew Pierre’s grappling hook and slid back the lever, letting its prongs spring out. I squinted, spotting a small triangular hole above the loading door where the wood had worn through. I swung the steel hook in circles, then let it fly. It caught the hole above the door and I tugged on it, feeling it embed itself in the wood. I paused, listening for any sudden movement, then started up the wall. Thankfully, I only had a few steps to climb to the loft. I righted myself and stepped carefully along the slim ledge as the strange rhythm grew louder within. I tugged the prongs free to return the hook to my belt and cracked the door open. 251 Hay and dust trickled down from the pile that had been shoved against it. I wrinkled my nose at the moldy straw that had been pushed to the outer edges by fresh hay. I spread the hay apart with cautious fingers, as if wading through weeds in a pond. The noise beyond the hay pile grew louder and stronger, the chant drumming through my entire body as I pushed deeper inside. Something reeked of sulfur, permeating the inside of the barn. Finally, I broke through part of the hay to peer through a giant square hole in the center of the loft. A large throng of men stood in formation on the floor below, dressed in black hooded robes and chanting in a strange language that sounded like Latin. Towering torches burned at either end of the ceremony. One robed man stood on a platform between two short pedestals, his arms raised to the assembly. Each hood depicted a grinning wolf, making them all look like black wolves with the robed bodies of men. Behind the leader, a large vat bubbled up something foul, the offensive sulfur odor I had detected. The hypnotic chant continued as two men each brought an animal carcass toward the leader. They laid both corpses on a pedestal, bowed to the leader, and backed away to resume their positions. They were two dead wolves. I shuddered. I had found the Lycanthru. Something shuffled nearby. I noticed four robed men standing on either side of me, looking down on the ceremony from separate corners of the loft. I steadied my breathing and didn’t move. 252 The leader produced a curved dagger and cut away a section of one wolf’s back. He held up the small rectangular pelt, showing it to the crowd as the chanting slowed. Then he wrapped it around the back of his neck, wearing it like a priest’s collar. As he did so, the other men produced similar wolf pelts and placed them around the backs of their own necks. Then the leader pointed straight up. Was he pointing at me? I held my breath. No one reacted to my presence. Instead, they craned their necks toward a skylight cut into the roof, which shed moonlight on each of them. The leader lifted his arms, welcoming the moon’s rays the way someone might welcome the sun’s warmth after a rainstorm. The others followed suit, raising their hands to the moon as if praising it. Then they produced small flasks from within their robes. The leader took his to the bubbling vat behind him. He lifted a large iron ladle from the vat, filled it with the foul goldenrod liquid, and poured it into his vial with a doctor’s precision. It bubbled a little more as he stirred the vat with his ladle, refreshing the sulfur stench in the air. He extended his arm to the other hooded figures. They stepped forward, one by one, to have him fill their own flasks. When everyone had taken from the vat, they returned to their positions to face the man on the platform. Then each one drew back his hood. I leaned forward and squinted at the leader. 253 And stared at the handsome features and piercing eyes of Duke Leopold Laurent. Duke Laurent, Papa’s influential friend. The man who bent down to smile at me after Jacque Denue’s friends attacked me, to ask if I was all right. The man who held a banquet to honor Francois, for his bravery in killing the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie. A banquet from which Francois went home drunk, escorted by the Duke’s men, to be devoured by a pack of wolves that same night. As if by coincidence. Or by design. Duke Laurent, who made an appearance at every funeral of every person killed by the wolves. Who railed against the King for ignoring his letters, in which he begged the court to send soldiers to rescue us. Letters he never truly sent. Laurent. I clenched my jaw and tensed my shoulders to keep from shaking the surrounding straw. Laurent spread his arms to the crowd. “My brothers. I know you have concerns about the men we lost last night, and the red-cloaked rider who killed them. I assure you, we will find him, whoever he is, and make him suffer. As to how he did it, I have sent word to the Prime, and I will let you know his conclusions once I receive them. You have my word.” I bit my lip, seething. His word. “Meanwhile, I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty has accepted my invitation.” This brought a cheerful murmur of approval and a few joyful shouts. Laurent waved down their 254 excitement with his hands. “So do not be distracted by last night’s incident. It is of little consequence, and in another month, will amount to nothing. So let us celebrate these fresh kills from our two newest initiates, and the strength they will soon share with us. Not to mention sharing in our glorious destiny. Soon all of our patience will be rewarded. Let us drink to that.” A few men laughed. Duke Laurent held up his flask with two hands, as if it was a precious infant. The other men followed suit. Laurent tipped his head back and they all drank. He winced as if it tasted bitter, but then licked his lips to savor it, like a drunkard sucking down stale alcohol solely for its effect. He stepped forward to stand directly beneath the skylight. The moon shone on his face as he closed his eyes with a look of rapture. He shed the black robe from his shoulders, revealing that he was completely naked. I nearly gasped, but kept quiet in spite of my shock. Then Duke Laurent’s face began to change. His strange grin pulled back at the corners of his mouth and somehow kept pulling, widening his lips. At the same time, his ears seemed to stretch away from his jaws, and moved impossibly up toward the top of his head. His nose grew larger, lengthening like that of a dog and extending over his chest. Gray hair sprouted from his cheeks, forehead and chest as he hunched forward. He fell to his hands and knees and I saw a bushy tail grow and lift from behind his back. His arms and legs narrowed while his hands and feet thickened and 255 grew into animal paws. He crouched on the floor of the barn and opened his fiery eyes, grinning again to display canine fangs. Laurent had become one of the six-foot wolves I fought at Favreau’s farm. The Lycanthru weren’t simply worshiping wolves. They were the wolves! 256 28. Seeing Duke Laurent transform into a wolf from my secret overhead perch, I inhaled with a sudden squeak, unable to stop myself. The four robed men standing at different corners of the hayloft turned sharp eyes on me. The nearest one clawed through the hay and seized my wrist. Before I could think, he yanked me from my hiding place for all to see. Straw and dust fell from my cloak like a rainshower. “It’s him!” he shouted. “It’s the red rider!” 257 He tugged me toward himself again as Laurent – in his horrid wolf-form – gaped up at us with bulging eyes. Others also turned toward us, while the other men in the hayloft ran at me. I kicked at my captor’s shin and he groaned, clutching his knee. I grabbed a pitchfork set against the wall and turned it on another man as he rushed at me, thrusting its tines at him twice. He backed away and lost his balance, falling from the loft onto the crowd below. The other two paused before continuing toward me. I couldn’t fend them both off at once. I turned back toward the hay pile where I had hidden. I shoved at it with the pitchfork, forcing the heavy pile out the loading door. I pushed myself out into the cool night air, the thick clumps of hay beneath me. I landed hard on the cushion of hay and rolled onto the grass, my side aching from the impact. Thankfully, the previous night’s rain had softened the ground enough to ease my fall. I whistled for Crimson as angry shouts grew within the barn, and the cultists rushed toward the front door. Crimson galloped straight at me, as if the barn’s rising chaos helped him to sense my need. I stood and grabbed the horn of his saddle, letting his momentum propel me up onto him as the door flew open and the Lycanthru poured out. I glanced back as we charged for the trees. The men stood outside the barn, gulping down liquid from their flasks and removing their black robes. I barely glimpsed their naked bodies crouching low to the ground and changing like 258 Duke Laurent did. Becoming an army of enormous wolves that bounded after me with nerve-rattling snarls. We raced deep into the forest. I drove Crimson harder, pounding past dark pine trees. The welcome cover of branches and leaves gave little comfort, since the Lycanthru wolves would know the terrain as well as I did. Hearing sharp growls, I turned to see three wolves closing in. I leaned against Crimson, having no way to fire the repeating crossbow with one hand while riding. Instead, I drew my father’s crossbow, already cocked. Slow and steady, keeping a sure grip as we galloped on. I took aim at the tan wolf nearing Crimson’s heels and fired, praying I was right about the silver. The bolt struck his flank, behind his head. A clumsy shot. Yet he fell to the ground with wide-eyed surprise. The other two wolves scrambled past him. One glanced back at the dead wolf twice, seeming confused that the creature didn’t rise. So much for my doubts. I had just killed a man. A man who could transform himself into a wolf. My fist clenched the reins tighter. The other two wolves quickened their pace. I leaned forward in the saddle to draw another bolt from my satchel bag. I loaded it and carefully lowered the crossbow’s strap to my right stirrup, my body in rhythm with Crimson’s stride. After looping the strap under my boot, I yanked up on it 259 to cock the bow. I turned as a wolf opened its jaws to nip at Crimson’s hind leg. I fired straight into its skull and it slumped to the ground. The third wolf watched its companion collapse, and his rushing gait faltered for a moment. I re-loaded and cocked the crossbow as I glimpsed more wolves, perhaps eight of them, approaching from the distant fog behind me. I shot the third wolf in his neck and he spun to the mud. They would reach me in less than a minute. I could never hold them off with my few remaining bolts. I pushed Crimson harder, clinging to him as we surged forward, heading for who-knew-where. I had to find an escape, somewhere. Anywhere. Anywhere to hide from these beasts that were once men! Father Vestille was right about how dangerous the Lycanthru were, just as Pierre was right about my hood, now a bright red flag drawing the wolves straight toward me. A sudden inspiration struck me. I slid Papa’s crossbow back into place behind the saddle and grabbed the repeating crossbow, slinging its strap over my shoulder. Then I untied my cloak with one hand. The wind blew the hood wide as I pulled it against Crimson’s neck and secured it to the reins. I pushed the flapping cloak from my face and looped the crossbow strap over my neck, then gripped the reins in my left hand as I drew my grappling hook. I flicked its prongs open and let the hook dangle at my hip. 260 I spotted a thick tree limb, the kind I needed, and swung the hook toward its base. It looped under the branch and locked in place as I gave Crimson a final prod and a shout. Then I lifted my heels and held tight to the rope, tugging myself out of the stirrups. I curved up under the limb as Crimson fled beneath me. He paused and glanced back, but I shouted again for him to keep going. He obeyed, confused, but slowed to a trot, refusing to stray too far as I scrambled up the rope. We had gained enough distance that the wolves wouldn’t see me climbing in the dark fog. At least, I hoped they wouldn’t. I hoisted myself onto the limb, straining to wrap my leg around it. I straddled the branch in time to see the wolves approaching. They stared straight ahead, focused on Crimson and the flapping cloak. I slid the repeating crossbow strap off my shoulder and took aim. Pierre had melted down enough material to load it with ten bolts, all tipped with silver. I fired at the three closest wolves as they rushed toward my tree, plugging each one. They dropped to the ground and lay silent. The silver worked. I fired at two more oncoming wolves, who broke their stride to view their fallen companions. Once struck, they lay a few feet past them in a heap. The other wolves slowed their rush. Some stopped altogether and hunched, twisting their necks toward the surrounding trees. I fired at the two in front, dropping them where they stood. 261 The rear wolves backed up a few paces. Some turned and fled. An auburn wolf growled back at them. “Cowards!” he shouted in a guttural voice. My blood ran cold. It was true, what I heard as a child. The wolves could speak. Men who could turn into wolves, but still think and speak like men. And they had organized themselves into a small army to attack the people of La Rue Sauvage. To attack families and their children. Why? I dismissed my questions for the moment. I had three bolts left. More than a dozen wolves remained below. If I took out their leader – the auburn wolf shouting at the ones who fled – then the others might back down. He still faced them while the other wolves paused in the clearing, shifting from side to side and looking uncertainly at one another. I took aim at his head, just below the pointed ear. He charged back toward the other wolves as I fired. “Come bac–!” he growled as my bolt sank into the tree trunk behind him. The wolves froze. I trembled, trying not to give away my position. Two bolts left. “There!” the auburn wolf snarled. “He’s up there!” The others padded a few steps back. Perhaps to get a better angle. Perhaps out of genuine fear. I focused on the auburn wolf but he bounded away before I could fire again, toward the 262 wolves that escaped. I puzzled over that while the rest of the pack shifted back and forth in the muddy ground. I worked to slow my breathing. Where had the auburn wolf gone? Had he run off to gather reinforcements from the barn? I couldn’t last long against them all, and I couldn’t wait them out until daybreak. I had to use every small advantage I had. Such as the fact that wolves couldn’t climb trees. Something snarled and rushed from behind the other wolves, who parted to make way for it. The auburn wolf charged between them, sprinting madly at the tree trunk where my bolt had embedded itself. He leaped at the tree and bounded off it to jump higher at another tree near me. He struck that trunk and sprang from it, launching himself at me like a flying nightmare, his jaws wide. I noted that normal wolves can’t climb trees, while I fired as a reflex, sinking my last two bolts into the auburn wolf’s mouth and gut. The beast spun backward in mid-air and twirled to the ground. It hit the earth like a sack of potatoes and lay dead. No bolts left. The others stared at the fallen animal and glanced at one another, shifting their paws. But they didn’t leave. Some fixed their eyes on the auburn wolf. Others backed away, ready to run. A few growled up at me. I turned toward a shuffling sound farther up the path, as the wolves also turned. Between the leaves, over the bushes, I could see Crimson’s 263 head as he trotted back and forth. He had insisted on staying close. I whistled for him. Time to escape, if we could. The wolves glanced in all directions. Crimson bounded through the trees, the red cloak wafting behind him like a soldier’s flag. The wolves backed away. “There are two of them!” one snarled. “Run!” growled another. Half the pack turned and sprinted away as I watched, amazed. It wasn’t just Crimson that startled them. They withdrew at the sight of my hooded cloak. The remaining wolves lost their courage and ran as Crimson charged at them. Ran from the sight of my red hood. I swallowed, releasing a hard breath. I shimmied down the rope as Crimson drew near, then jumped onto his saddle and kicked at him, leaving the grappling hook behind. I could retrieve it tomorrow. Or Pierre could make me another one. We galloped toward Father Vestille’s hovel, kicking up mud and leaves, Crimson’s hooves pounding with the rhythm of my heart. I steadied my heartbeat, gathering my thoughts. Everything had suddenly become clear, in one horrifying night. One horrifying hour. The wolves spoke. I had not imagined it. The wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie had spoken to unsettle me. He never expected me to survive and expose his strange ability. The Lycanthru were transforming themselves into wolves to attack people, led by Duke Laurent. 264 But I had discovered their weakness. The slightest touch of silver killed them. They now feared me. Feared my red hood. I thanked the Lord for revealing everything to me, my senses surging with relief and rage as we rushed through the frigid night. Everything became so clear. I could stop them. I could kill them all. 265 266 267 MY WAR 268 269 29. We emerged from the seclusion of the forest pines and trotted into the clearing where Father Vestille’s hovel sat. Nestled deep in the woods, his home was easy to reach and easy to maneuver from. Riding all the way into the village was out of the question, now that I knew the Lycanthru’s secrets. They would hunt me down. I could never use Pierre’s loft again. I tried to settle my racing heart. I had found the Lycanthru. And discovered Duke Laurent leading them. I still saw the image of his face 270 beneath that monstrous wolf-hood, standing before the cult that was terrorizing the province. Still saw Laurent and the other men drink that foul sulfurous liquid and transform themselves into enormous wolves. I shook off my fears. Silver would destroy them. I could destroy them. I had to keep my courage. More important, I had to keep myself hidden so I could rest. No one could know that I had anything to do with Father Vestille anymore. Or all of our lives would be forfeit. I led Crimson to the stable behind the stone hovel and surveyed the area for any witnesses. Then I kicked aside straw and lifted the secret door to Father Vestille’s underground sanctuary. I checked again for any sign of movement from the surrounding trees, then led Crimson down the ramp. He could fill up on oats and bed down for the night. I lit a candle and found the underground room much cleaner. No more cobwebs or dust clouds, and only a faint lingering odor of mold. Father Vestille must have spent a good part of his day making this place into a home. I swallowed. Could I ever again have a place to call home? Yet Father Vestille did his best to provide one, without even knowing whether I would return. I stepped back up the ramp to pull the top door shut, then got Crimson settled. Once he lay on the straw pile – much larger and fresher than last night – and closed his eyes, I climbed up the ladder and knocked on the trap door. I heard Father Vestille’s muffled voice and some quick shuffling overhead. 271 I was growing so accustomed to this night life, the life of a nocturnal beast, that I had forgotten normal people still retired to their beds well before midnight. “Helena?” Father Vestille called in a harsh whisper from above as he creaked across the floorboards. I pushed the door up and climbed into the warm candlelight of his front room. He stood there in his nightshirt, holding the candle on its tray. His anxious eyes were bloodshot. “I’m here,” I said. “Crimson’s settled for the night.” I stepped up into the room and eased the door shut. He deserved far more explanation of my activities, but I acted as though I had said all that was necessary. I couldn’t expect him to understand. He accepted it, clearing his throat. “Do you – Have you had anything to eat?” My pride urged me to lie and say I didn’t need anything. But my more practical stomach growled. “I’ll get you some bread,” Father Vestille said. “I still have some cheese and lamb from tonight’s supper. I hoped you might return.” He shuffled away to his table. I followed slowly as he unwrapped the remains of bread from a cloth in a round basket, then unwrapped some cold lamb and hunks of cheese from another platter. He looked at me, somewhat abashed. “I can light the fire again to heat this up.” 272 I shook my head. I didn’t want him to have to do anything more. Nor would it be wise to send up chimney smoke from his hovel after midnight, with the Lycanthru searching for me. I shuddered and clutched my shoulders. “It’s fine. Thank you.” I grabbed the meat and tore off a chunk with my teeth. I had not eaten for hours and the excitement in the forest only made me more ravenous. I was well into my second bite when I noticed Father Vestille staring at me with concern. I realized I had failed to give thanks again. I stopped chewing in mid-stride and bowed my head to thank the Lord for the food. For this place. For my life. Whatever might be left of it. I opened my eyes to find him still staring. Perhaps he was less worried about my prayers than for my half-starved condition. “Can I get you anything else? Do you need to bathe again? I can wait out here, or outside if you like.” I shook my head and chewed. I had to discuss tonight’s events with someone, and quickly. Even if it had to be Father Vestille. Before it was too late. “Father Vestille,” I began, then finished chewing. “… Something happened tonight.” He stood listening. Then he turned and pulled up a stool to sit before me. I sat in the chair by his table. It felt good to sit. To do something normal and safe. To imagine I could be safe again someday. I swallowed and lowered my eyes. “I saw them. The Lycanthru. I saw them all.” 273 His voice rose in a panic as he gripped my shoulders. “Helena. Are you all right?” I nodded. I didn’t shake him off. It felt good to be held, the closest thing to an embrace that I would experience for some time. My entire life had changed in a few days. In one terrifying night. I could never be the same person again. I could never again enjoy a feeling of safety or home or family. “There were several men, wearing robes. With images of wolves on them. They performed some sort of ritual. And – they changed into animals.” I met his eyes, which held horror but no disbelief. “Father Vestille. They’re the wolves that have been attacking everyone. They become wolves.” Father Vestille stared at me, then swallowed hard. “Are you all right?” he asked again. I gave a small nod. “Did they see you?” I felt cold inside. “Yes. They chased me. I shot a few of them.” “You shot them?” He seemed equally horrified. “Yes,” I said, offended. “It was wise at the time.” He sighed with some irritation. “Go on.” “Never mind,” I said, starting to rise. He remained in his stool and put a hand on my shoulder. His eyes were penitent. “Please.” I fumed for a moment, then sat back down. “I saw their leader. He removed his hood to drink 274 some potion that changed him into a wolf.” I swallowed. “It was Duke Leopold Laurent.” Father Vestille’s eyes widened. He continued to glare at me for several seconds. “The other day,” he muttered. I squinted at him. “What day?” He looked off, grinding his teeth. “The day your – your mother and Suzette – were killed. Duke Laurent invited me to his chateau for a talk.” My nerves flared with rage. “About what?” He set his jaw, narrowing his eyes. “To see how your family was faring. After the loss of your father.” I gasped and shook. Laurent had planned every attack. The banquet to make Francois drunk while Laurent’s own friends surrounded him at the tavern, waiting to strike at his home later that night. Then luring Father Vestille away from Mama and Suzette so the Lycanthru could murder them in broad daylight. Laurent. “Helena. I’m glad you choose to confide in me, but – why, exactly, are you telling me all this now?” I shivered. We both knew I had pushed him away for years, rejected his every offer of help or friendship. “Someone needs to know,” I said. “I can’t be the only one. Someone else needs to know, in case …” I broke off, uncertain how to finish. He finished for me, his eyes wide. “In case anything should happen to you.” He rose and turned away, frustrated. “I told you the Lycanthru 275 were dangerous. And if the Duke of La Rue Sauvage is involved –.” I stood and leaned toward him. “He’s not just involved. He’s leading them!” “Leading them against you!” he said. “Because you challenged them. Because you sought them out and found them.” “I can’t change what I’ve already done.” “But what will you do now? Will you go on fighting them? Killing them? These are not animals, Helena. They’re human beings.” “They’re not animals, and they’re not human beings. They left their humanity behind to become these things.” “You can tell yourself that if you wish. It’s still murder.” “This is a war!” “A war you started.” “No. A war they started. They’re killing innocent people. Innocent children! And you want me to let them!” “You know I don’t want that.” “I don’t know what you want. You want to help me. You want to shelter me and care for me. But you don’t want me to fight the things that killed my family.” He strode at me. “Because I don’t want them to kill you, too!” We held one another’s gaze for a moment. He was shaking. “I don’t want them to, either,” I said quietly. “But I can’t let them take any more children. Ever again.” 276 He struggled to calm himself, unable to respond. He knew what I felt, having hidden my family away during the war. But it seemed he had forgotten how to take risks to protect innocent people. “Helena. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. But I’m worried. Not just for your physical well-being, but also for your soul. If you wage this war, I fear for what you might become.” My stomach churned. He was like a man with a musket who refused to fire at the predators on his doorstep. “If you’re that concerned about what I’ll become, I can find another place to stay, so you won’t be burdened.” As I folded my arms and stepped away, I realized I felt something more than disgust at his cowardice. I feared he might be right. If I kept on fighting these monsters, could I become just as cold-hearted and bloodthirsty? Would I become the scar-faced monster that Jacque Denue and his cronies feared? “You are no burden,” Father Vestille insisted. “You can stay here for as long as you wish. I will gladly shelter you and feed you, and give you whatever you need to live a full and rewarding life. But I cannot help you kill.” I kept my back to him. I couldn’t expect a priest to help me kill anyone, beast or not. It seemed he was doing everything for me that his faith would allow. Which made me question my own faith. Was I truly seeking justice or merely revenge? Yet how could I let them ravage our people, our world, while I retreated into a safe, 277 warm house and pretended there were no monsters outside my door? When I could do something to stop it. I turned to face him. “Right now, what I need most is your confidence in me.” “I have every confidence in you, Helena,” he said. “But I cannot help you take up a sword. I might as well be putting it to your throat. It will only end in death.” I kept my body rigid. I couldn’t let him know the fear I felt, or let him put any of his own fear into me. I had no choice but to fight these beasts. Except to retreat, and wait to die. I lifted my chin. “Then let’s say we understand one another, and agree to disagree on what must be done.” He looked sad and distant, as if I were his own daughter leaving home, never to return. As though he was mourning the loss of my soul. I prayed he would be wrong. “I will accept that, for now,” he said. “I only want to help you, Helena. You’re all the – You are the only one left from your family. I don’t wish to lose you, too.” “I’ll do everything I can to see that you don’t. I promise.” He glanced aside, shuffled his foot, cleared his throat. “Come. Finish your supper and you can get some rest.” I followed him to the table without another word and did as he said, like a condemned man marching to the gallows. 278 Crimson woke before me. He stood in the darkness, where stripes of light shone through the cracks in Father Vestille’s floorboards above us. I ignored both Crimson and the light and shut my eyes, drifting back into a swallowing sleep. I woke perhaps an hour later, feeling refreshed and stronger. I sat up on the cot and had an odd feeling. A feeling of freedom and security. Of home. The underground cellar held little light or fresh air, but it was safer than any place where I could take refuge above ground. Where the wolves reigned. I stood to my feet and stretched. I wore one of Father Vestille’s old nightshirts, which hung down to my knees. But it kept me warm through the night, along with the blanket, and helped me feel human again for the few hours I slept. I looked about for my clothes. Then I remembered Father Vestille had offered to scrub them clean for me, despite my protests. I smiled now at the thought of him with a basin of soapy water and a washboard, working away at the filth on my pants. The pants he was embarrassed for me to wear in public, as anyone would be. The pants I wore to move freely enough to kill the wolves, which deeply disturbed him. Yet he cleaned them for me, despite his discomfort with my new life. It almost felt like having parents again. Someone to care for me. To accept and support me, even if he didn’t agree with my choices. I started toward the ladder to retrieve my clothes. Then I found them right in front of me, 279 folded in a basket at the foot of the ladder, along with my cloak and boots. The basket had a rope tied to its handles, which lay in a heap beside it. He had finished the work and lowered the container to the floor, mindful of my modesty by not entering the room. He was a good man. Better than I had thought, while he cared for Mama and Suzette over the past several months. Better than I treated him. Still, for all he had done to help us during the war and for all he did to shelter me now, he had still abandoned us when we needed him most. When I needed him most. After the wolf attacked, we needed courage and guidance, but he was away visiting other provinces, other churches. Seeking his own escape instead of facing them down, however he could. If he wanted to help me now, I would gladly accept it, but I couldn’t forget the past. I sighed and grunted. I had no time to mourn his choices. From the look of the sunrays filtering from upstairs and my well-rested state, it was already midday. Only a few hours left to report last night’s events to Pierre before darkness set in again. I reached for my clothes and carried them to the cot with my cloak and boots. Time to set to work. 280 30. L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne smelled of rich oil and fire from the day’s work, nearly over now as dusk approached. Monsieur Leóne was away again, delivering special orders and securing more material. Pierre could not stop gaping at me for the entire time I told my tale. The events of last night – the Lycanthru, their ability to speak, the clear effect of the silver bolts, their new fear of my hood – every detail enthralled him. I told him everything, except for two significant details. 281 “Where did you go afterward?” he asked. I curled my lip. “I can’t tell you that.” He blinked, wounded. “Why not?” “Pierre, I trust you and I value your help. But I can’t reveal everything that I’m doing. Just trust that I’ve found shelter.” “But why can’t you stay here? You’re welcome to sleep in the loft anytime you want.” I touched his hand to show my gratitude. “I know. But I can’t let anyone find me here, or find you. Too many people know I’ve visited you before. That alone places you in danger. And I can’t let anything – I don’t want to endanger you any further.” His brows curved up with hurt, but he nodded his understanding. “Did you see any of them?” I blinked. “The wolves?” “The Lycanthru. Did you see any of their faces? Recognize anyone?” I stared blankly at him, imagining his obvious emotions on display as one of the Lycanthru – perhaps Duke Laurent himself – questioned him. I pictured the Lycanthru seeing through Pierre’s attempts to protect me as he claimed to know nothing. I saw them seize him by the throat and drag him deep into the woods where their mouths would transform into hungry jaws. “No,” I said. “I never saw their faces. I don’t know who any of them are.” Pierre frowned. “Too bad.” He locked his gaze on me. “Especially if they know who you are.” 282 “They don’t. Yet,” I assured him. “But they will.” “Red, don’t do anything dangerous.” I blinked at him. “I think it’s too late for that.” “Anything more dangerous than you’ve already done,” he clarified, sounding annoyed. “If you keep after them, they’re going to come after you. And they’ll find you.” “I don’t think so,” I said, thinking of the safety of Father Vestille’s hideaway. Wondering how long it might remain safe. “In any event, they’ll be searching for me already, don’t you think?” Pierre swallowed hard. “Of course. You saw them. Saw what they do. They won’t let that pass.” I nodded. “Which means I’ve got to stop them first.” “Red, you can’t! These people – these monsters, whatever they are – how can you stop them? You don’t even know who they are or where to look for them next.” “I know where to start.” “All right. Then I’m coming with you.” “No, you’re not.” “Come on, Red. How do you expect to stop me from following you? You know I’m a faster rider.” “I know.” I sighed and turned toward the other work table beside us, wishing I could take him along and lean on his help. But it would mean exposing him to the Lycanthru and marking him 283 for death, the way I had been marked. “Forgive me later?” I asked. He squinted, confused. “For what?” I struck his jaw hard and he spun in a half-circle on his way to the ground. Thankfully, his head missed the edge of the oak table. I dropped the heavy chunk of lead back on the work table, where I had just snatched it. I shook my stinging hand as I stared at Pierre’s quiet body lying on the floor, hoping the lead punch wouldn’t leave much of a bruise. I wanted to embrace him, stroke his head, thank him for his endless support and care. Instead, I had knocked him unconscious. I kept staring at him, wishing I was a different person. Someone he could love and be happy with. But I wasn’t. The Lord had assigned me a strange destiny, however short-lived it might be. To stop as many of these murdering creatures as I could. Before they finally killed me, too. I blew Pierre a silent kiss, hoping he truly would forgive me as I asked. For what I had done and for whatever I was becoming. I stepped over him and headed out the door. 284 31. The same hush fell over the crowd of swaying onlookers as I entered La Maison tavern, crossbow in hand. Before I pushed through the heavy doors, they were joking, shouting, jostling one another. Now they all fixed a silent gaze on me before quietly returning to their drinks and murmured discussions, stealing glances at me over their shoulders and cupped hands. No one risked speaking to me, perhaps fearing my wrath, or being otherwise drawn into my dangerous world. 285 Touraine eyed me from the bar as well, ending his conversations and shooing people away. He turned his back to me as I approached and took a seat on the stool. “Order a drink,” he muttered. I considered reminding him that his tavern refused to serve young girls, but this was no time to make sport. People were watching us. I laid my crossbow on the counter. “Monsieur,” I said, as if I was seizing his attention. He turned. “A glass of your best wine, if you please.” He soured. “Buttermilk it is,” he said, reaching below the counter. I frowned. He had not forgotten, after all. “Just put some water in a mug. And make it look dangerous.” He took a new mug and pitcher, turning his back to me again. “You had another busy night.” “Very busy. You heard of it, then?” “Heard there was a hunt. Heard some men found a pile of dead wolves out in the woods. Large ones. But no one knows who found them, and there’s nothing there anymore.” I narrowed my eyes. “Nothing there? Then how do they know there were any wolves there in the first place?” Touraine bowed his head, pretending he needed to polish a mug with his rag. “A rumor. Some claim they saw that red rider fighting wolves in the forest. They say he left a few there, dead. But they’re gone now. Others say that’s just a rumor spread by some drunkards. What do you say?” 286 He handed me the mug and I drank, wondering how to pretend it was alcoholic. I decided to drink it slowly, staring at the counter while he pretended to ignore me. I lowered my voice. “It’s no rumor. I assume someone started talking about last night’s events until they were ordered to keep silent.” I took another sip of water. “Have those men been back tonight? The ones who love hearing about wolf attacks?” “Same place as always. They’re calmer tonight, though, maybe because Duke Laurent joined them. He made a rare appearance.” My nerves flared. I turned to see them, gathered around their usual table. Lieutenant-General Sharrad sat near the head, with his gleaming blue-gray eyes. Duke Leopold Laurent was seated beside him, like a spider at the center of its web. The Duke’s royal advisor, Simonet, sat in the next chair, wearing his usual callous expression. They all studied me with violent disdain. I grabbed my crossbow and rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle?” Touraine asked, turning suddenly. “Mademoiselle, where are you going?” he demanded in a whisper. Once more secured, the crossbow hung at my hip as I strode toward the table. The table where the Lycanthru gathered to celebrate their victories after attacking people in the village. After chewing on the flesh of innocent mothers and fathers and five-year old girls. My boots clomped across the floorboards as I marched at them, my 287 cloak rippling behind me. They set down their drinks and sat taller, their backs rigid, their attention focused. Nearby observers shrank back, hunching over their drinks, eager to avoid us. I stood before the Lycanthru and stared straight at Laurent. No one moved. Duke Laurent squinted, confused. He blinked in surprise. “Helena?” A strange smile twisted across his lips. “Is that Helena Basque beneath that hood?” He recognized my scars across the lower half of my face. I no longer cared. I grabbed a nearby chair and slid it to the end of the table, opposite Laurent. I sat, with all eyes on me, as I lifted my hands to draw back the hood, revealing my face and blonde hair. Their eyes bulged in an odd mixture of horror and delight. They seemed outraged to discover their adversary was a mere girl. Yet they seemed all the more eager to take their revenge, now that they had seen my face. “So,” Laurent said, breaking the thick silence. “I haven’t seen you since – oh, yes. Since your little sister’s funeral.” Blood surged through my neck and temples. I wanted to lunge across the table and strangle him. But I could do nothing here, with so many witnesses. People who only knew Duke Laurent as I once did: a generous benefactor to our tiny community, a man we were all blessed to have leading us. He was a true wolf in sheep’s clothing. 288 Seeing he had rattled me, he continued to study my reactions with measured calm. I couldn’t let him unsettle me again. “Well,” he went on. “… What new things have you been up to lately?” I stiffened my posture. “A lot of hunting. Late at night.” Scorn lined every face around the table. I could almost feel, almost smell, their hatred of me. Even Simonet narrowed his eyes with bitterness. I was only a girl, but they wanted to destroy me at least as much as I wanted to destroy them. Laurent twisted his lip. “So I hear.” “So you witnessed,” I said. “From your platform.” The men around the table drew a sharp intake of breath. Sharrad bared his teeth, looking so savage I thought he might spring for my throat. Laurent fingered his mug, lifted it and drank. Then he continued to study me. “You seem to have learned a lot in one night.” “Not enough. I know what you are. What you become. But I don’t know which of you attacked me, or which of you banded together to kill Francois Revelier. Or the rest of my family.” Laurent squinted at me, cockeyed. “You’re accusing us of attacking you, Helena? And of killing your woodcutter friend? Forgive me, but I thought you were both attacked by a wolf. Isn’t that the story you’ve been telling everyone? Weren’t you attacked by a big, bad wolf?” The men snickered. 289 Laurent continued, like the ringmaster of a traveling circus troupe. “If you change your story now and say you were attacked by a man – well, I’m not sure how many people will believe you.” “There were witnesses.” “Oh?” Laurent asked in a mocking tone, as if this was new information. “Where are they now? Was that woodcutter one of them? Or your Grand’Mere? Or your Papa?” Hot blood filled my temples. Laurent folded his hands, satisfied. “Seems you’re the only one left to tell your tale, Helena. And reasonable people don’t often listen to hysterical little girls who lose their temper at funerals and refuse to associate with anyone. Especially when they take to dressing in men’s clothes and running through the woods late at night, hunting for witches and big bad wolves.” The others burst into laughter, except for Simonet. He continued to watch me with reserved eyes. I waited for the others to finish their mindless chuckles. “I’m not interested in exposing your dirty secret activities.” “No? Then how can I help you, Mademoiselle?” My cheek twitched, but I kept my body rigid. “I only want our province, once and for all, to be rid of you.” They stared at me in stunned silence. Then exploded into laughter. One man actually wiped tears from his eyes while attempting to regain his composure. 290 Laurent looked over the heads of his comrades and smiled. Other raucous conversations had resumed behind us, drowning out whatever was said at our table. Laurent smiled at the group and leaned forward. “Mademoiselle, let us be honest. You’ve done very well. You struck at us and actually did some damage. I’m not so proud that I cannot admit you beat us down. Twice. So you have my respect and admiration, and I congratulate you.” His grin hardened into stone. “And now it’s over. You cannot seriously hope to ‘rid’ your little province of me. Or the rest of our order, which happens to hold eighty-eight members. All with the same abilities that my friends and I share.” I tensed my back and shoulders, keeping my lips impassive. I couldn’t let him know he frightened me. “Eighty-eight? Still?” He grinned, seeming genuinely amused. “I apologize. You have reduced our ranks down to, what? Seventy-five? Yet as I see it – seventy-five to one? I think we can still rely on our numbers.” “Rely on them while you have them.” Laurent leaned forward again, incredulous. “So you’re serious, are you, Helena? You intend to take us all on?” I said nothing. He kept his eyes on me as he leaned toward Simonet. “Tell me what you see, Simonet.” I met Simonet’s cold eyes, which seemed to pierce my soul. “She’s passionate in her position, Your Grace. Unfortunately for her, she has no real plan. 291 She might continue to do damage, but she knows she won’t last long.” I tried to steel myself against all fear. To keep him from seeing it. Laurent turned to his right. “What do you think, Sharrad? Does she look serious?” Sharrad locked his gaze on me. His thin lips spread in a cruel smile. “I think she looks delicious.” His stare burned into me until I could actually feel his hunger. “You don’t frighten me,” I told him, stiffening my shoulders to convince myself. “You killed my Grand’Mere and you scared me in the tunnel when I was a child. But you won’t frighten me again.” Laurent squinted and exchanged looks of confusion with Simonet and Sharrad. “You think that Lieutenant-General Sharrad killed your Grand’Mere?” “I recognize his eyes.” Laurent seemed to understand, but acted as if I had said something amusing, while Sharrad’s nostrils flared. “Helena, dear. The wolf that killed your Grand’Mere is dead. Your friend, the woodcutter, killed him with an ax. That was not Vigo Sharrad, the head of our police force. Tell her who it was, Vigo.” Sharrad’s blue-gray eyes blazed. “That was my brother, Gustave.” I shuddered, while Laurent grinned with malice. It was Sharrad’s brother, with the same unsettling eyes. 292 “And tell her what you’ve wanted to do since that day, Vigo.” Sharrad twitched, as if wanting to pounce on me. “To devour the one who killed him. Which we did, a few years back. And to finish the job Gustave started.” “He means you, my dear,” Laurent said with delight. “Helena, consider what you’re getting yourself into. I’m willing to forget these recent incidents and we can part ways. I don’t expect us to remain friends, but if you walk away now, I promise you’ll live.” “No guarantee from me,” Sharrad said. Laurent put up a hand to quiet him. “I can keep our order in line, Helena. Including our honorable Lieutenant-General. Out of respect for your achievements – and your considerable losses – I can ensure your survival. However, if you continue this reckless endeavor …” He raised his hands in surrender. “There is little I can do to protect you. You can see how angry my friends are. I believe they want your blood.” “Blood, flesh and bone,” another man snarled beside me, his hair and eyes wild. “So as the last living member of your family,” Laurent continued. “If you place any value on your life at all, you’ll take this chance now to leave, unharmed. Otherwise, I cannot be certain what will happen to you.” He seemed to expect me to believe his lies, the way Papa did. I no longer bothered to hide the trembling throughout my body, even from Simonet. Despite my fear, I now shook with 293 something else: rage. “Nothing is ever certain in La Rue Sauvage, Monsieur Laurent. Except death.” I pushed the chair away and stood. My cloak whirled behind me as I strode toward the door. “Where are you going now, little girl?” Sharrad called across the room. I spun back at them, the blood filling my cheeks as they laughed. Sharrad meant to unnerve me, using the same words the black wolf had used. His own brother, the Lycanthru with shining eyes who killed my Grand’Mere and left me scarred. They wanted to remind me that, after all these years, I would not find anyone to believe my reports about them. About men who changed into talking wolves and threatened to gobble up little girls in the night. They meant to remind me that I was completely alone in my fight against them. But I already knew that. I raised the repeating crossbow to my shoulder and they abruptly froze, falling dead silent. Two of them shrank back. Other conversations stopped abruptly around the large room. “Hunting,” I said flatly. Everyone in the tavern watched me, with what might have been awe or revulsion. Either way, it was mixed with fear, which was what I needed. I had made the Lycanthru afraid. If the rest of the town feared me as well, so be it. I stepped outside and mounted Crimson, anxious to ride off and get my shaking under control. They had unnerved me, but I had also 294 unnerved them. I simply needed to focus on quieting my fears and unleashing my anger. They would remain in the tavern, deliberating over how to deal with me. I would have to be even more cautious about my contact with Touraine and Pierre, to keep them from linking us to one another. Which left me even more alone. I had no choice. I knew what I had to do. What I alone could do. I had destroyed a handful of them. There were seventy-five Lycanthru left. I would start keeping count. I rode hard into the open plain and galloped toward the forest. 295 32. Over the next two months, I fought the wolves, beat them down, struck fear into their hearts. In the waning hours of the night, I snatched one person after another from their jaws. Killed one wolf after another with a silver bolt. Until the whole village knew that someone was fighting for them, and had started to refer to me by the name the wolves had given me: The Red Rider. I couldn’t get at Duke Laurent, but I had reduced his numbers, and I could feel his rage at 296 every wolf I struck down. Knowing I would not give up. Knowing I was thinning his ranks. I continued to take refuge in the underground longhouse beneath Father Vestille’s hovel, while I received secret supplies from Pierre and secret information from Touraine. Though I had to maintain greater caution, now that people were watching me more closely, both wolves and villagers alike. And I had no way of knowing for certain which of the villagers might secretly be wolves. Tonight, Crimson waited for me in a thicket of trees near La Maison, keeping out of sight, while I stole through back alleys toward the rear of the tavern. After waiting for what felt like ages, I seized an opportunity to cross the street, using a passing carriage to hide from onlookers. Then I rushed to the cellar door, yanked it open and dropped inside, finding a basement corridor that led to the recessed storage area. I waited even longer in the wine cellar itself, though I felt far more secure within the quiet room, free of witnesses. Finally, Gerard Touraine descended the steps to the corridor and entered the wine cellar with his lantern. “Monsieur Touraine,” I whispered. He whirled about, wrinkling his brows as he held up the lantern. His face softened as he recognized my hood, hiding behind the wine shelves. “Mademoiselle? Is that you?” “Are you alone?” 297 He glanced over his shoulder on instinct, but there were no other footsteps. “Yes. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in over a week.” “I know. I’ve been finding information elsewhere. It’s safer that way.” He pursed his lips, understanding but looking disappointed. “So why are you here now?” “To see what you know. What you’ve heard. It’s not the safest, but it’s still the best. I haven’t heard much information lately, but I didn’t want to endanger you any more than I had to. I’ll understand if you wish me to leave, to keep yourself safe.” I swallowed, hoping he would not dismiss me. He set the lantern on a wall hook. “I don’t wish that. But there’s one thing I would like.” “What is it?” “Your name. Unless you prefer to be called ‘The Red Rider’ now.” I smiled. “It’s Helena.” He nodded, satisfied. “Helena Basque.” I squinted at him. “If you already knew who I was, why did you –?” “I like to hear from the source directly,” he said. “Now. A boy’s been looking for you.” I blinked. What would Pierre be doing, looking for me at La Maison? Unless I had been too careless, and he had connected my activities to Touraine. “A boy with brown eyes and a mess of blond hair?” 298 He wrinkled his brow. “I didn’t see the color of his eyes, the way he squints. Surly looking fellow. He’s upstairs now, asking for you again.” I blinked. “Who are you talking about?” “Said his name’s Jacque. Jacque Denue.” A flush of anger and fear surged within me. I wanted to confront Denue and start beating on him before he got the chance to hit me again, but I saw no point. “What did he want?” “Wants to meet with you. In private. Said he knows something about the, eh, the ‘Licannors’, something like that.” I stiffened. “The Lycanthru.” “Yes, that’s it. The Lycanthru. Something about the Lycanthru and Duke Laurent.” A dozen possibilities raced through my mind. Had Denue truly discovered something of their secret activities, and of mine? Was he one of the Lycanthru himself, though all their other members were men? Was this another ploy, a petty attempt to ridicule and attack me again? Why seek me out now just to abuse me? “You said he’s upstairs?” Touraine gave a curt nod. “In the bar.” Denue might have some information I could use against Laurent, if he had discovered the Duke’s connection to the Lycanthru. Could he have also discovered something that might help me stop them? “Go about your business,” I told Touraine. “Say nothing to him.” “You don’t wish to meet him, then?” 299 “Perhaps. But I don’t want him to connect me to you. Can you keep him in the bar until nightfall?” “Most likely.” “Good. Can I keep my horse in your stable by the cellar?” “Of course. It’s for guests of La Maison.” I nodded, hoping no one would recognize Crimson. But I had nowhere closer to hide him. “Thank you. If you’re willing, can you find an opportunity to stand there? My horse is just within the forest. I’ll get to the stable and whistle for him when you’re ready, so you can lead him across before anyone sees him.” He considered this, looking up and stroking his chin. Perhaps deciding how to draw the least attention to himself and Crimson when they moved. “Or I can try to lead him there myself,” I said. “You don’t need to risk anyone seeing you with my horse.” He shook his head, smiling. “You’re risking enough, for all the rest of us,” he said. “My pleasure to help … ‘Red Rider’. Be back in ten minutes.” He left. I stood behind the shelves of wine that would so offend Father Vestille, and marveled at Gerard Touraine’s bravery on my behalf. I now saw that Francois placed him in high regard for more than his knowledge of the town gossip. 300 33. From the rooftop of Focult le Tonnelier – Focult’s Cooper Shop across the street – I watched Jacque Denue stroll out of La Maison. The moonlight cast a dark, swaying shadow of his clumsy movements as he continued past the building where I perched. I had stolen out of the cellar as night fell, while villagers poured into the front doors of La Maison. Those who wished to drink were focused only on the tavern entrance, while those who did not were focused on retiring to their own cottages. 301 Giving me ample room to climb to the roof of La Maison with Pierre’s grappling hook, then leap across to Focult le Tonnelier after most of the drinkers went inside. As I had waited and listened, first on one roof and then the other, I heard a few people mention Jacque Denue searching for the Red Rider. Thank God he had not connected me to Touraine. Apparently he had confided his search with several others in the tavern. I now descended from the roof of Focult le Tonnelier into the dark alley to find out why. “You’ve been asking for me,” I said beside him. Jacque Denue nearly fell over his own feet as he twisted about to see me peering at him through my large hood. “You,” he gasped. “Y-Yeah. You’ve been fighting them, haven’t you? Killing them?” I frowned, recalling Father Vestille’s displeasure with my crusade. “Yes.” “You know what they are, right? That they’re not – not wolves. They’re not even human.” He knew. He knew everything I had learned and perhaps more. “Yes. I know. But what do you know? About Duke Laurent?” He looked about, nervous. Almost terrified. “I can’t be seen with you. They’ll kill me.” “They’ll kill you, anyway, so talk.” He shook his head, looking hysterical. “They got people all over, you know? They could be watching us now.” 302 I couldn’t argue with that. The Lycanthru could be hiding anywhere in the shadows, in wolf or human form. He looked around again, over his shoulder and down the street. “Look, I’ll walk a block. Watch where I go and meet me there later. Don’t let anybody see you.” He backed away, half-stumbling as he marveled at my cloaked appearance. I let him depart, then crept to the corner of the wall to see where he headed. He hurried across the street, still glancing in all directions. At the end of the block, he stopped in front of a large horse stable and examined it. Looking around to confirm no one was watching, he threw up the latch on the door and stepped inside. I waited a few moments in the quiet, listening for any other movement. I studied the torch over the tavern door behind me. No one else would leave La Maison this early. I hurried from one alleyway to the next, moving down the street. Then I broke into a quick run for the stable doors and went inside. The stable felt even larger within, with room for over twenty horses. A single lantern at the opposite end of the stable gave sparse light, where Denue stood waiting. He seemed calmer now, standing taller as I strode toward him, my cloak wafting behind me. Nevertheless, his face paled as I approached. “Now,” I said. “Tell me what you know of Laurent.” “All right, I’ll tell you.” His voice turned menacing. “He’s eager to meet you.” 303 Hay shuffled behind me and strong arms coiled around my waist. I gasped as they squeezed harder, pinning my arms into my abdomen. I struggled to break free but my assailant was too strong. He hoisted me off my feet and I noticed a sign burned into the wall overhead: Les écuries de Brocard. These were Monsieur Brocard’s horse stables. The Lycanthru used Denue to set me up. He smirked as two of his cronies strode up from either side of me. I recognized Slob and Freckles as they grinned in triumph. The one holding me had to be Muscles. Denue leaned into my face to gloat. “What you gonna do now, ‘Red Rider’?” His friends laughed. I kicked hard against Denue’s chest with both heels, knocking him off his feet as he wheezed. My kick pushed me back against Muscles and we fell to the ground hard, though his bulk softened my blow. I elbowed his gut and he released me to roll away and rise to my feet. The fifth boy from Denue’s gang stood behind us with a toothy grin. They seemed to have forgotten how I beat them last time. Or they assumed they had me outnumbered. I kicked Muscles’ jaw as he tried to stand. I needed my strongest attacker to stay down. He grunted and moaned like a wounded animal, rolling in the dirt as he clutched at his face. Tooth kept smiling and spread his feet in a fighting stance, as the two beside Denue did the same. Then they all drew hunting knives and held them out, preparing to lunge. 304 “That’s right, wench,” Denue said from behind me. “This time, we brought better weapons than a club.” “Clever,” I said. “Wish I’d thought of that.” I raised my crossbow to Tooth’s startled eyes. He dropped the knife and raised his hands, backing away as I circled behind him. I was out of patience. He joined Slob and Freckles, who still gripped their knives, unsure. I cocked my head at them. Both knives fell to the floor. I nodded toward the ground beside a horse stall. “Over there.” They raised their hands in surrender as they backed toward it. Muscles crawled after them, still rubbing his jaw. Freckles scowled at me. “We’ll get you. You just wait,” he said. I fired a bolt between them. Freckles squealed as it struck the wood of the stall behind him. “Sit down and keep quiet,” I said. They dropped to the floor, hands still raised. I slung the crossbow over my shoulder and approached Denue. He drew a knife from his rear pocket and lunged, the blade flashing in his fist. I kicked up at his wrist and pinned it against a wooden pillar. He whined in pain as the knife fell. I kept his hand there and backhanded him across the jaw. I punched him a second and third time to send him spinning to the dirt. The other boys leaned forward, ready to stand. After I glared at them, they sat back on their 305 hands. I grabbed Denue by his tunic and tugged him to my face. He squirmed, his eyes bulging. “Lemme go, you witch! You wear pants and fight like a man. What kinda girl are you?” “One with little patience.” I shook him for emphasis. “Who told you to attack me? Was it Laurent?” “Yeah,” he grumbled. “Figured it’d be easy to nab a stupid girl.” “Capture? Not kill?” He shook his head. “I ain’t no killer! Just needed money. He’s paying us plenty to bring you unharmed.” “He wants me unharmed so he can harm me himself. You know what he is. You told me yourself.” “That’s what he told me to say, to make you come with us. I don’t know nothing else. Those are just stories to scare little kids!” “They’re not stories and you know it. Even if Laurent was an ordinary man, why would he pay you to capture me? What do you think he’ll do with me? And how long do you think he’ll let you live, after you do what he asks? Another night? Another few weeks?” Jacque shook his head. “He don’t care about me, so long as I help him.” “Once you’ve outlived your usefulness, he’ll make a meal of you. Like he does with the rest of La Rue Sauvage.” “Yeah, so what am I s’posed to do about it?” 306 “You know what sort of girl I am. What sort of boy are you? Sooner or later, he’ll kill you, now that you know his secrets. You can help me stand up to him, or start numbering your days.” “You’re crazy! I ain’t fighting the Duke of the whole province!” “You don’t have to. Just do what he told you to do. Take me to him. Tell him you captured me, but leave me opportunity for escape. When he least suspects it, I can –.” Something shifted in his eyes as he glanced toward the horse stalls. I whirled toward his friends, still seated, in time to see a horseshoe flying at me. It struck my forehead. The stable spun as I fell to the ground. I blinked at the dull pain as everything started to blur. Denue loomed over me, grinning. “Change of plans,” he said. I tried to clutch at him but I could barely sit up. His fist connected with my jaw and everything went black. I woke to shouts. “Imbecile! I told you to bring her last night!” It was Laurent’s voice. I shuddered, feeling cold and confused. I lay on my side, my jaw aching, my head throbbing. My throat tasted like dry manure, and there was a suffocating smell of dust from the surrounding hay. But not from Brocard’s stable where Denue struck me. 307 Somewhere less clean. Somewhere I had been before. I blinked awake with terror. I was back in Brocard’s barn in the forest, where I had intruded on the Lycanthru’s ceremony. Only now I lay on the ground floor, a few feet away from the vat of sulfurous liquid that filled the room with its foul odor. Standing over me on the raised platform, just fifteen feet away from the vat, Laurent glowered at Denue in a rage. “We grabbed some food and fell asleep,” Denue said. “She took a lot out of us. But I got her and she’s here now. What difference does it make?” Laurent backhanded him with a fist that sent Denue sprawling from the platform onto the dirt. “That is the difference, you impudent fool. From now on, do as you’re told.” My shoulder ached where I had been lying on it. My head pounded like a drum. I squinted at the few lit torches smoldering in the room, as rays of the approaching dawn peeked between cracks in the wood walls. How long had I slept? Ten or more of the Lycanthru stood around Laurent. A few wore their black robes and wolf hoods. Others wore their daytime clothes. Laurent’s advisor, Simonet, stood close by, his hands folded behind his back. Beneath their feet, I saw my repeating crossbow. If I could leap for it before they noticed me … 308 My body pulsed as I prepared to rise, but I couldn’t move my hands. I tugged again. Then I fingered the thick hemp binding my wrists behind my back. “Your Grace,” Simonet said in a monotone. I glanced back to find him studying me. “Well, look who’s awake,” Lieutenant-General Sharrad snorted. Laurent’s entire posture relaxed at the sight of me. He strode forward with a jaunt in his step and knelt down. Then he gripped my cheeks hard and lifted my face to his. “Good morning, Mademoiselle. A pleasure to see you again.” I grunted and tried to pull away. The other Lycanthru grinned like hyenas. “But a little too early, I think.” He released my head to fall painfully back to the ground. Then he raised his fist and brought it crashing down onto my jaw. 309 34. I woke again more slowly, roused by the sulfur stench. Sore muscles ached in my shoulders, thighs, and the back of my neck. I struggled to open my eyes as my chin rested heavily against my chest. Wake up, I ordered myself, inhaling the sulfur deeper, listening to the bubbling vat. Wake up! The room was full of sunlight and noise. My temples throbbed and I tried to grasp my surroundings. With an effort, I lifted my head to meet the eyes of Leopold Laurent, flanked by 310 Simonet, Sharrad and about thirty other men. He grinned as he held my crossbow. I flinched and shuddered, which made them all laugh. I felt paralyzed, unable to move anything but my head and neck. I glanced to either side and discovered my arms were spread apart and bound. Thick ropes extended from my wrists to distant supporting pillars. My breath caught in my throat. I tried to move my legs, to stretch my sore thighs. But they also stood apart on the dirt floor, my ankles secured to the same wooden pillars. I stared down at myself, helpless before the entire cult. “Welcome, dear Helena,” Laurent said in mock greeting. “Or should I call you, ‘The Red Rider’?” They exploded with hoots of triumph. All but the stone-faced Simonet, standing at Laurent’s side. A few men wore their black robes, but most were ready to resume the day’s normal work. “I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you chose to visit us,” Laurent continued, like a gracious host. “A pity you can’t stay long. Although you’ll be with us much longer than we hoped. We meant to finish you last night. To – what is the word? Ah, yes. To ‘rid’ ourselves of you.” This drew another round of cruel chuckles as Laurent patted my crossbow. I tried to stay calm as I tugged at the ropes, testing them. They had no give whatsoever. “Unfortunately, your incompetent friend, Jacque Denue, failed to bring you at the proper 311 time, but waited until it was near dawn. We all lead busy lives during the day, which only leaves us the night for our private activities. The saddest part is that I have significant business to tend to this evening, so our plans for you will be delayed even further. But don’t fret, Mademoiselle. Come midnight, we’ll all gather to bid you a fond farewell.” I pulled at the ropes again as a reflex, knowing it was pointless. “You can’t see behind you, Helena, but there’s a long trough there. That’s where we’ll toss your bones when we’ve cleaned all the meat off them.” My breath came in rapid gasps, to each man’s delight. “I claim her belly,” said a gruesome red-haired man. “I want one of her thighs,” Sharrad said with a smile, narrowing his blue-gray eyes. Laurent stepped forward. “All I want is her face.” “Not much meat there, Lord Laurent,” Sharrad said. “No,” Laurent admitted as he stood before me. He squeezed my cheeks together so hard I struggled to breathe for a moment. “But I want to see her eyes, wide and screaming, as she realizes her little adventure is over. Just before I devour her.” I shook in his grip. They were going to eat me! 312 His face hardened into stone. “You should have accepted my offer to walk away, Helena. Instead, you persisted in your stubborn attacks, killing over twenty of us in the last two months. Making quite a name for yourself.” He clenched his teeth, almost snapping them together. “Now you can die like the rest. Except that you’ve earned yourself a much slower, more painful demise. I’m sure you’re quite impressed with yourself, for how well you’ve done. So consider it an honor, the agony we intend to put you through this evening.” I kept still and focused on taking tiny breaths through my nose and teeth. I turned to Simonet, the only one not joining in the others’ celebration. His dull, fixed expression made me tremble even more. “The only reason we’re not feasting on you now is we need moonlight to transform,” Laurent explained. “We don’t need it for long, but it’s easiest for us all to change at night. Once we assume our new shape, we can keep it as long as necessary. But someone in town might notice if fifty men didn’t perform their duties today. And to be frank – every one of us wants a piece of you.” He released my face and I gasped, hanging my head. “Sharrad,” Laurent called. Sharrad stepped forward with a strip of cloth. He yanked it apart with his fists, showing its thickness as he marched toward me. “Why are you doing this?” I asked Laurent quickly. “Why are you attacking everyone?” 313 Laurent held up a hand, stopping Sharrad in his tracks. “Why?” he repeated. He spread his hands like a showman before the other men. “Why not?” They roared with sadistic laughter, as though I said something hilarious. Laurent paced, as if considering the question for the first time. “Power, Mademoiselle. Unlimited, eternal power. The age-old lure of immortality. All we need to do is kill a wolf for its pelt …” He aimed my crossbow between my eyes, smiling as he played a hunter. “And keep it among our possessions. Then, after absorbing a few rays of moonlight, we can transform into the most fearsome creatures the world has ever known. Provided we also drink the Lycanum potion.” He waved a hand toward the foul, bubbling vat. “Together, these things make us stronger. We age less rapidly. We remain powerful, even in our normal form, so long as we continue to feast now and then. Especially when we feast on the innocent.” Quick as lightning, he backhanded my left cheek. It stung like a block of wood. The room spun for a moment while I regained my breath. “You see what I mean?” He yanked off my hood, his force nearly choking me with it. Then he seized a clump of hair at my scalp and wrenched my head back. I gasped at the sharp pain. “But you’re strong, too, aren’t you, Helena? Stronger than anyone imagined. So we have to take extra measures to deal with you. And to make an example of you.” 314 He shook me by my hair. I clenched my teeth and let him hold me like a marionette. Resisting would only make it worse. “The intriguing thing about power, Mademoiselle, is that once a man tastes it, he can’t stop hungering for more. Tonight, when the moon is high, we shall assume our more powerful form.” He leaned close to my cheek, enough for me to smell his last drink of red wine. “Then we’ll feed on you, piece by piece, growing stronger – as you die, screaming.” No, I thought. Lord, don’t let me die like this. Help me escape! Send them away and help me escape! He grinned, my hair trapped in his fist. “I should conclude my business and join the others here by eleven o’clock. Then we’ll spend the night tending to you, for the last time, before we feast on the main course. That gives you a full day to consider your folly and form your apology to me, for your brash interference.” “What about the silver?” I gasped. “Why does it hurt you?” He gave my hair another sharp jerk. “You’re so persistent, Helena. You still hope to learn something to pass on to your friends, if you have any left. If you do, don’t worry. We’ll find them and finish them off. Just like you.” I thought of Pierre and tugged violently at the ropes, in spite of myself. Despite the pain that shot through my scalp as he tugged my head back in place. I considered Father Vestille and Gerard Touraine. A few anxious words from any one of 315 them, wondering whatever happened to me, could be enough to rouse Laurent’s suspicions and seal their deaths. Because of me. His voice softened to a purr. “Of course, if your apology is humble enough, I might let you beg for your friends’ lives. As for the silver …” He rested the point of my crossbow’s loaded bolt against my cheek and stroked me with it like I was his pet. “When your friend, Francois, killed Gustave with his silver ax, we were surprised that anything could harm us. But we consulted the Prime, who is far more experienced in these matters.” “The Prime?” “Don’t concern yourself with that, Helena. In La Rue Sauvage, I am the Prime.” The bolt jabbed at me as he growled, but it didn’t draw blood. He smiled, regaining his composure. “In any event, he explained that different Lycanthru had come into contact with silver over the years and died without explanation. We simply learned to avoid it. We don’t need to know the reason, any more than we need to know why we need the Lycanum or the pelt or the moonlight. We follow the rituals that were written down in prior centuries and reap the benefits. So long as there are unsuspecting villagers with children in our midst, I should live to be well over a hundred, with no one daring to challenge me.” He whispered harshly at my ear. “While you won’t even make it to age seventeen.” 316 He yanked my hair again. I yelped at the sudden pain, which ended abruptly as he released me. I lifted my head lazily, feeling dizzy as the barn and Laurent blurred before me. I blinked and saw that he held a blonde clump of my hair. He regarded it with mild surprise, then smiled at me. “I’ll just keep this as a souvenir.” He slid the hair into his waistcoat pocket as if it was a precious heirloom. I stared in horror and disgust. They were demented, every one of them, and Laurent was the most twisted of all. “Any more questions, Helena? Or are you finished?” I quivered in the ropes. “What do you think, Simonet? Is she through?” Simonet observed me without expression. He descended from the platform and stepped toward me, examining my face like I was an intriguing insect. “She’s frightened, Your Grace,” he said. “She knows it’s over.” I stiffened to keep from losing control. Anything I did or said now would only confirm the truth. I had no plan. No way out. Laurent’s eyes and face relaxed even more. “That’s what I wanted to hear. Now, Sharrad.” He stepped back as Sharrad marched at me with the cloth strip. He ducked under my bound arm and stood up close behind me, his broad chest against my back. “Wait! Someone will find me. You can’t –!” 317 The cloth came down past my eyes and was tugged between my lips. I struggled, my nerves flaring, as Sharrad secured the gag, turning the rest of my sentence into muffled gibberish. He knotted it tight against the back of my neck, catching strands of hair. Laurent stepped forward, studying me with a satisfied smile. I could barely move. Now I could barely utter a sound. He raised the crossbow to my face. “By the way, I believe this is yours.” He tossed it to the dirt beneath me. I stared down at it, loaded and ready to pierce their hearts. I tugged my wrists hard, which only tensed my sore muscles and kept my captors entertained. Laurent gingerly drew the hood back up over my head. “No one is likely to travel this way, but we can’t risk some fool hearing you struggle. Not before we’ve had our fun with you.” He stroked my cheek as if he were still the family friend I once trusted. “Think about how to apologize, Helena, to save a few of your friends. You’ll have all day to consider it. Jacquard will be here to watch over you.” He smiled over his shoulder at a tall unshaven man who nodded from his seat on the steps. “The rest of us would be missed, but Jacquard’s position is …” He pretended confusion. “What is it you do again, Jacquard?” Jacquard twisted his lip with annoyance. “Cooper’s apprentice,” he said. “Oh, yes, that’s it,” Laurent said, as if he had just remembered. “And a poor one at that. His 318 master might be relieved to do without him today. But he can keep an eye on you here, to make sure you don’t – wiggle too much.” He grinned like the devil. “Until tonight, then.” He walked out. Each of the Lycanthru filed out after him, smiling at me as they passed. A few of them waved. One devilish man made a chomping motion at me. I hung there between the pillars, a chill of horror surging through my nerves as they strode by, each one hungry for my blood. Each one eager to taste it when night fell. Behind them, Jacquard squatted and poked at the logs beneath the base of the vat, reducing the flame. I imagined them boiling me for their dinner as I stared into each ravenous glare. A shorter man marched at me, grinning with malice. “The party won’t start ‘til nightfall, Mademoiselle,” he said through tobacco-stained teeth. “Why don’t you get some sleep?” The men behind him laughed as his fist struck me and my world went black. 319 35. I awoke with a start. I lifted my head and blinked, breathing the sulfuric air rapidly through my nose. The gag had grown stale against my tongue. The man named Jacquard rose to a sitting position on the platform, where he had been sleeping. My sudden movement apparently woke him. He snorted, stretched, then regarded me with a scowl. “Up and ready for the day?” he said without humor. 320 It remained bright outside, but the shadows had shifted to the opposite angle. It was a little past noon. I had gotten a full but fitful sleep that I now felt in my sore limbs. I looked back at each of my wrists, still bound to the thick pillars. I shook my numb arms as best I could and rotated my wrists to get the blood flowing back into them. My lower back and the calves of my legs ached from standing suspended for so long. Below me, the crossbow still lay useless on the ground. Jacquard yawned and stood to fully stretch. I heard his back crack as he twisted his torso. Then he faced me with his hands on his hips. “Go on. Struggle some more for me.” I breathed slow and even. “No?” he asked. “Too tired? Get some rest, then. You’ll need all your strength tonight for screaming.” He sat back down and leaned lazily against the long counter beside the bubbling vat. He glanced at it, wondering whether to adjust the fire again. Then he folded his arms and studied me. “You thought you were something, huh? You really thought you could beat us.” He continued to study me from head to toe, watching for any sign of resistance, satisfying himself that I could not escape. Then he rose slowly and walked behind the long counter. He bent behind it and I heard him open cabinet doors and slide heavy objects across shelves. He stood, producing a small flask and a large bottle of liquor. He poured himself a small sampling and sipped it, 321 then eyed me again, looking disappointed that I had not moved a muscle. He lifted his flask toward me. “Your good health, witch.” He emptied the flask and filled it again. I steadied my breathing. Everything had happened so fast, I barely had time to think. And I could do nothing with the entire cult watching me. Jacquard would be a different matter, I hoped. I kept still, spread between the pillars like an animal carcass to be carved and eaten over a fire. Or Samson, the Bible hero who lost his great strength and was captured by his enemies who jeered at him, thinking him helpless. Until he asked them to place him between the pillars that supported their stronghold, where he pushed the supports apart when God restored his strength, destroying them all. I lifted my chin and tried to relax. I allowed Jacquard to study me again before he poured himself another drink. I couldn’t reach the crossbow, but I had a few advantages left. Reminding myself of that helped me calm down. First, they had left only one man to watch me. More important, they imagined me helpless. Which I might be if not for Pierre. Sweet, ingenious Pierre, who suggested the crazy idea of helping me fight like a wolf, before my first night out at Favreau’s farm. “I can’t give you teeth,” he had said, “but I’ve got something that might work for claws.” 322 He was so proud of his brilliant invention, as he should be, always asking me how my blades were working. I fixed my gaze on Jacquard as he tilted back another drink. Then I flicked my wrists, causing the silver blades to slide out from the top pockets in my gloves. They locked in place and I spread my fingers to hide them. If I closed my fists, the broad knives could be seen, extending just beyond my knuckles. With my palms open, Jacquard would never notice me sawing slowly through the ropes behind them. I just had to keep my movements slow and careful. Fine, Pierre, I thought. They work just fine. Shadows of clouds shifted across the floor, from the skylight cut into the overhead ceiling. I scraped away at the ropes, one fiber at a time. It maddened me to cut so slowly. But anything faster would draw Jacquard’s notice. Even more maddening, the ropes’ thickness ensured that I would be scraping through them, one gentle stroke after another, for hours. Of course, once they frayed most of the way, they should pull apart all at once. Then the crossbow would be back in my hands. Jacquard jerked up suddenly, narrowing his eyes. I stood still, like a deer sensing a hunter’s presence. I locked eyes with Jacquard and held still. “Not trying to wriggle free, are you, Mademoiselle?” My heart stopped. I stood rigid, hoping he would not step closer. 323 Jacquard lifted the flask to his lips, still watching me, then drank. I felt a wave of relief as he swallowed and refilled his flask. I resumed my sawing motion, one slow cut at a time, barely moving my wrists. I wondered if I had even made progress, but I dared not glance at the ropes. I had to trust they were fraying, a little at a time, until Jacquard lost interest in me once more. I prayed silent thanks that Laurent had chosen such a lazy guard. A more responsible man might have checked the ropes again to make certain they were secure. But Jacquard had no reason to imagine anything otherwise, not knowing Pierre’s cleverness. Pierre. I had to free myself and warn him. Warn Father Vestille and Touraine. In my rush, my right hand blade wedged between fibers and jerked the rope. Jacquard glanced up, seeing the rope shake. I froze. He almost smiled. “Go on. Try to pull free.” I ignored him, but kept my whole body rigid. Waiting for him to ignore me as well. “No?” he teased. “You’re not even going to try?” He chuckled to himself and poured another drink. I had to slow down. I couldn’t save anyone if Jacquard discovered my actions. I relaxed my breathing and focused. The moment he drained another flask, I glanced to my right. The rope had started to fray. 324 I sawed at it again, seeing new fibers sprout up. Given enough time, I could free myself. I just had to remain calm and patient. An hour later – judging from the shadows beneath me – I had scraped halfway through each rope. A few more strokes and the remaining fibers would start to shred. So long as Jacquard kept his distance for the next hour, I could pounce on him before he knew what happened. The silent crossbow still waited on the ground for me. Just a little more time and steady work … Jacquard sat back on the platform, still sipping from the flask in his hand. Over the last several minutes, his study of me had grown more intense. I eventually stopped worrying whether he could see my blades working. Though he watched my every movement, he could not see the silver shafts behind my palms, or the ropes slowly severing behind them. Yet he focused on me more than ever, while his head bobbed a little from all his liquor. He spent several minutes observing my boots alone. And of course, my trousers, which barely covered my legs. He took another swig of wine, eyeing me strangely. “You know – I like the way you look there, writhing.” My throat went dry. I glanced back down at the crossbow. He rose slowly to his feet and staggered once. I hoped he might fall over unconscious, but 325 he wasn’t drunk enough. “About this power, Mademoiselle. It increases everything. Not just our strength. It also increases our appetites. I need to eat more, smoke more. Drink more.” He lifted the flask. Then his eyes narrowed and traveled the length of my body. “I need more of everything.” I stiffened. As he took another swig, I made broader strokes against each rope. He returned his attention to me and I stopped. He smiled, as if recalling a private joke. “You know, I crave things now that I never wanted before. Never even thought of wanting. Strange things, like seeing a woman – or a child – suffer.” My whole body pulsed and quivered. Jacquard seemed to delight in it, as he approached me in small, measured steps. “Good thing is, brave Mademoiselle, that now I can satisfy all my cravings. No matter how wild they get.” He set his flask at his feet and stood directly before me, smiling and reeking of alcohol. He reached up and gently drew back my hood. Uncovering my eyes and hair and my scarred face. He snorted. “Not too bad, for all that.” He nodded at my triple wounds. “Almost pretty. Anyhow, you’ll do.” I fought to stay calm. To keep from jerking away at his touch, as he stroked my hair below the gag. He undid the knot and pulled the cloth free. I gasped, sucking air into my stale mouth. He seized my face, cutting off my deep breaths. I panicked and tried to pull away but his grip was too strong, squeezing my cheeks tightly the way 326 Laurent had. But Jacquard’s fingers jabbed my skin and pressed against my teeth, determined to produce pain. I shook in the ropes. I cut at them again with a single swipe, while he stood an inch from my face. Then I cut again. And again. “I know, sweet thing,” Jacquard said, enjoying my discomfort. “I’m supposed to leave you unharmed for tonight. For the others. But I figure, when someone’s already this damaged, who’s gonna notice a few more cuts and bruises?” I seethed, clenching my teeth to speak. “I couldn’t agree more, Monsieur,” I said as I sawed through the last fibers. The ropes fell like logs to the ground as my wrists dropped. Jacquard blinked at me, trying to grasp what had happened. I tensed my numb arms and drove my bladed gloves into his sides. His eyes bulged. Then the pain pushed through his stupor and he screamed, a horrid animal cry. He knocked over the flask at his feet and it shattered as his knees buckled. He clutched at my waist to stay upright. I tore the blades free and shoved them into him again. He cried out as the blood clung to my knives. I shook, wanting it to end. Wanting him to be a wolf, so I wouldn’t feel like vomiting, as I stabbed him again. He sank slowly, as tears streamed down my cheeks and his fingers lost their hold. He crumpled to the ground and collapsed on his broken flask. I collapsed onto him, exhausted. 327 I had just killed a man. Not a wolf, but a man. And I could do nothing to take it back. What had I become? Something banged from the rear of the barn, behind the platform. I started suddenly and lifted my head to listen. Had they left another guard behind? Something struck low against the wall again like thunder, much harder than a human could have. Crimson. I pushed myself off of Jacquard and stretched toward my bound ankles. I couldn’t hope to return to a standing position with my feet so far apart, but I stretched enough to saw through the rope encircling the inside of my heel. Once I freed my other foot, I shook my legs to get the blood flowing back into them. Then I raced to the platform door and threw it open. Beyond it, I found a spacious stable with eight stalls, only two of them filled. One with a horse that must have belonged to Jacquard. The other with Crimson. He whinnied in a fitful rage as he saw me, tossing his head in the stall. He must have put up a tremendous fight after they found him, because they had bound him in a cat’s cradle of ropes, much like they bound me, securing his legs, flanks and neck, so he could only shake helplessly until they returned. He was the main course Laurent spoke of, that they would enjoy after finishing me. I threw open the stall door and saw he had finally wriggled one hoof free to kick at the wall. I 328 hugged his neck to calm him. It did little to still my own rage, which began to boil over. “It’s all right, boy,” I seethed. “It’s all right. We’re leaving this place.” Night fell like thick tar. The flame beneath the vat had nearly died out, but I could still smell the sulfur amidst the barn’s choking dust. At long last, I heard their horses approach and gallop around the barn to the rear stable. The door to the stalls creaked open and there was a murmur of confusion and rage. I smiled, imagining their faces as they discovered Crimson was no longer bound in their cruel trappings. Then came quick footsteps and the sound of the connecting door as it flew open. The men rushed into the center of the barn with their lanterns, scanning the darkness for me and Jacquard. They found Jacquard soon enough. His dead body now hung where the Lycanthru had positioned me, between the two pillars. It had taken an hour, with Crimson’s help, to string him up properly. It was monstrous, I knew. But far less cruel than the Lycanthru tying me there alive. They held their lanterns up to his face to confirm he was dead. They wondered among themselves what had happened, how I had escaped, where I had run off to, where my horse had gone. More of them poured in, as I hoped they would. At first there were only a dozen or more. Then I counted eighteen, soon twenty-five, finally thirty-329 three. They flooded in so quickly I nearly lost count, but I kept them in my sights. I had to know how many there were. They huddled together in outrage, blaming Jacquard’s carelessness, blaming one another, demanding answers. They prepared to search the barn, raising their lanterns and looking about. Only one of them sniffed at the alcohol in the air and fingered a piece of the hay that I had stuffed into Jacquard’s shirt. I smiled. They had each brought the very weapons I needed. I stood up suddenly from the overlooking hayloft and stared through the enormous square hole at the men searching below. Hay and dust fell from my shoulders and my spreading cloak as I raised the repeating crossbow. My first shot tore through the lantern of the man standing in front of Jacquard’s corpse. It yanked the lantern from his grip and knocked it into Jacquard’s back, which I had dressed with hay and doused in liquor. The body burst into flames, a human candle that lit the length of both thick ropes. The fire caught on the pillars, also sprinkled with alcohol. Everyone gaped at the erupting blaze as I shot through the lanterns of two other men. The first one struck the ground and started an insignificant flame on one side of the barn. But the second hit its mark on the opposite corner where I had spilled more liquor, creating a blaze that roared to life against the wall. It followed the trail of alcohol that lined the interior, the fire scrambling along the wall to connect at each corner. 330 The Lycanthru’s eyes bulged as the room heated up rapidly. Crimson whinnied and rose from the darkness beneath the hayloft. I whistled and he leaped into position. I dropped onto his saddle, ignoring the bruising in my groin and thighs, and drove him to kick open the front door. We rushed into the night air and I leaped off to secure the entrance. The men recovered from their shock and charged at me as I shut the door and threw the locking bar down. Crimson trotted back to retrieve me while I drove three bolts into the bar for good measure. A sudden shuffling of dirt within told me the Lycanthru had halted upon seeing the protruding silver bolts. I stepped into Crimson’s right stirrup with one foot and held on as he whisked me to the rear stable. I jumped off as two men emerged from the rear door, one carrying a lantern. I shot them both where they stood. I shut the stable door and threw the bar down, then shot my final two bolts into it. After grabbing the Lycanthru’s discarded lantern, I mounted Crimson to circle around the barn. Light and heat emitted from every wall. Nevertheless, I took the lantern and hurled it against the front door, as the Lycanthru pounded against the inside of it. “Rider!” they raged. “Rider!” The lantern burst into a spreading blaze that licked up the alcohol on either side of the door and raced along the outer wall. I had lined the walls with liquor from corner to corner, inside and out, and spread the hay out evenly within. Creating an 331 inescapable tomb of flames. I watched the rest of Brocard’s barn erupt in a rising inferno, climbing higher and higher into the black sky, like a sacrifice on an enormous altar. So now I was a murderer. I had killed thirty-three men in less than a minute. Thirty-three men who gave themselves over to black magic to prey on the people of La Rue Sauvage. On innocent children. But no more. Whether I was a warrior or a murderer, I could do nothing to change it. I didn’t ask them to attack my family. That was their doing. And this was the result. For them, and for me. So be it. I turned Crimson away from the mounting inferno and the Lycanthru’s raging screams as fire billowed up every high wall. My cloak flapped behind me as we rode hard into the forest. I spotted a few other Lycanthru with lanterns moving into the clearing, stunned by the sight of the blaze. One noticed me riding off but only gaped at me, too surprised to give chase. I had enough moonlight to find my way through the well-traveled woods. I was glad I had abandoned the lantern, giving them no way to track me. My heart and pulse raced, my nerves hot with rage and fear. They meant to kill us, to devour me and Crimson for their own sadistic pleasure. They only received a portion of what they deserved. But I would serve up more to them before daybreak. 332 I never meant to become this, whatever I actually was. A murderer. Perhaps a monster. Whatever I had become, and whatever would become of me now, I would see to it that I destroyed the rest of the Lycanthru. I would see to it that no more innocent people in La Rue Sauvage suffered at their hands. I never meant to become a sixteen-year old warrior, and despite what Father Vestille believed, I had not started this war. But I would end it. 333 NOTE FROM AUTHOR D.A.

PRAISE FOR The Red Rider Saga (from previous editions) “I got sucked in from the beginning. … I was up all night reading, imagining and feeling for this poor girl … heartbreak and twists and adventure all rolled into one. … This is a book to let a young woman read to teach about inner strength and what one young girl can do against so many odds. That one action can accomplish so much. This book gets my absolute seal of approval. I could even picture this story on the big screen! Angi Burns ~Rabid Readers Book Blog ( ( ( “Get ready to see the classic tale reimagined as you’ve never seen it before. … transforming a children’s fairy tale into a supernatural action thriller with a Zorro-style vigilante.” A.K. Preston, author of The Gevaudan Project ( ( ( “A thrilling paranormal Red Riding Hood. … a well-written retelling with a twist and a much stronger Red. … would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal thrillers or reimagined fairy tales. C.S. Wachter, author of The Sorcerer’s Bane ( ( ( 1 “Action filled novel. Journey of a teenage girl. A story of love, courage, friendship and more. The author has got it all in this book.” Jay Deb, author of The Assassin ( ( ( “[Randall]’s unauthorized sequel to Little Red Riding Hood blends great characters with a compelling storyline and places it in the middle of a legendary premisè… a well-told story about seeking justice rather than revenge and finding a way to properly overcome evil. What I liked best about this tale was that this little girl was a flawed character—and she seemed to have all rights to believe the way she believed and think the way she thinks—but [Randall] is careful not to glorify the fact she wants revenge. In fact, the story is about Red learning through her quest to destroy the wolves that revenge will, in fact, destroy herself. It’s a big concept and [Randall] does it well.” Josh Olds, Life is Story ( ( ( “There are stories with great writing styles. Those that have amazing plots. Those that sustain your attention with every word. Ones that exceed your expectations of great lines, with a satisfying ending. Mr. [Randall] accomplished all of these aspects. I can only hope that the right person will come across The Red Rider and turn it into a movie that is sure to be a box-office hit.” Kym McNabney, Story Contributor, Childhood Regained: Stories of Hope for Asian Child Workers by Jodie Renner and Steve Hooley 2 WHAT READERS ARE SAYING (from previous editions) “Full of thrilling discoveries and heart-pounding adventure! Helena “Red” is as complex, driven, and bold as Katniss Everdeen (Hunger Games). You will be cheering for her from the start!” ( ( ( “This book was fantastic!!!!!!! Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. A fantastic twist on the original Red Riding Hood. Helena is my hero.” ( ( ( “Fantastic, suspenseful retelling of Red Riding Hood. A story of wolves and black magic. How the beautiful, innocent child Helena, becomes the physically scarred, determined, skillful hunter of wolves. How the stuff of nightmares becomes reality for a whole community, and a young woman's strength and overwhelming desire to completely destroy the terror that haunts her dreams and waking moments. Powerful imagery, wonderful storytelling. I thoroughly recommend it.” ( ( ( “Definitely not what I expected. There were plenty of twists and turns packed into this book. A good read for any fairytale/fantasy lover.” ( ( ( “While the story takes place in France a long time ago, it has a contemporary feel to it, and the story moves quickly. You find yourself rooting for the main character. I'll certainly buy the next [D.A. Randall] novel if it's as good as this one.” ( ( ( 3 “The Red Rider is a well written book full of adventure, mystery, twists and turns with a fair amount of moral teachings included. This is a book that would be excellent for young teens and adults alike.” ( ( ( “If you enjoyed Little Red Riding Hood as a child, you will love this book. It has mystery, adventure, and suspense. Once you start to read it you won't be able to stop until you finish it. This is the first time I have read anything by this author but he has found a fan of his writings. He is an amazing storyteller.” ( ( ( “Imagine Little Red Riding Hood being scarred by her traumatic encounter with the big bad wolf, and imagine that the big bad wolf ‘isn't a wolf.’ Then let her grow into an angry teenager, give her a red cape, a reloading crossbow and a grappling hook, and gallop with her on her one-supergirl-war against a coven of big bad wolves. The Red Rider is a teen action-fantasy hero and that is how the novel reads. No spoilers here: The suspense with author [D.A. Randall] is just how dark this fantasy will turn, as he takes the white-washed premise of the Brothers Grimm and gets much, much grimmer. A great fit with the grown-up fairy-tale versions of recent years that has emerged in print and film. I recommend it with pleasure. ( ( ( 4 5 RED RIDER RISING by D.A.

RANDALL NEWSLETTER RANDALL ALLEN DUNN ACTION THRILLERS 11 MY SCARS 12 13 1. I never meant to become this. The lazy breeze made my red hooded cloak waft about my shoulders as I sat atop my horse, my cheeks warmed by the consuming blaze. The same gentle wind lifted the roaring flames higher and higher, racing through every inch of the building. I could do nothing to silence the screams of the men inside as they shouted my name. The name they had given me. “Rider! Rider!” Nothing to change what I had become. 14 It was not entirely my choice. I had not started this war, nor had I planned to become a sixteen-year old warrior. I started out as a little girl, innocent as any other. Enjoying life, enjoying my family, anticipating a happy future. Until they had disrupted my entire world, nearly a decade ago … “Hit her again, harder!” Egged on by his friends, Jacque Denue had smiled and rammed his fist into my gut. The jarring pain had shaken my prone body, making me want to vomit. I held back the bile, since the other four boys had me pinned and I didn’t want to swallow it back down my throat. At least the early morning rain had muddied the ground enough for me to sink into it, while it ruined my little dress and burlap cloak. When would Papa come back with the wagon? I was too hoarse to scream any more. I could only raise an arm or a leg as much as they let me, curling into a weak ball to protect myself. The village boys laughed as they took turns punching at my stomach, chest, arms, groin and face. My horrible, scarred face that helped them justify their attack. “You sick, ugly witch!” Jacque spat. “You stay out of La Rue Sauvage, you hear? Stay out of our village!” His palm weaved around my arms and slapped me. Tiny lights swirled about my face as 15 the sting settled into my cheek. I wanted to sleep. To sleep forever and make them go away. “Monster!” one boy yelled. “Disgusting hag!” shouted another. I stopped trying to rise from beneath them. I shut my eyes, accepting blow after blow, my arms and legs burning with bruises. I no longer saw them. I saw myself and the image they so hated. The seven-year old girl with blonde hair and blue eyes and three thick scars slashed across her face. They ran at a slant, like torn pink ribbons. The top one started above my left eye and ended below my right. The second ran below my left eye and scraped across my distorted nose. The last tore across my left cheek and my mouth, ending beneath the enlarged right portion of my lower lip. No wonder they called me a monster. My mind pictured something else as they kept hammering my stomach. I saw the wolf, large and leering and unstoppable, its jaws opening wide to swallow me. The wolf that stood on its hind legs and loomed over me. The living nightmare that spoke to me through its grinning fangs: Where are you going, little girl? I found my voice and screamed. “Helena!” “Run!” the boys shouted. The pain stopped – or at least, stopped mounting - replaced by a scuttling and sloshing of feet through mud puddles and fallen leaves. “Helena! What have you boys done? Come back here, you!” 16 I kept my eyes shut and lay still, sobbing but relieved. Papa would stop them. He would chase them, punish them, his blue eyes blazing with rage above his thick black moustache. He would catch every last one of them and make them sorry for hitting me. Strong arms surrounded me. They snatched me up, then slowed to cradle me. “Helena.” Papa’s voice broke. “Helena.” “Papa,” I rasped, too weak to hug him. I winced out tears as he held me, keeping my eyes closed, until I could breathe regularly again. “Did you get them?” His chest sighed. “They ran away.” “All of them? You didn’t catch any?” My voice croaked like a frog’s. “Helena, I’m taking you to Doctor Renoire.” He rushed me to the next street where we had left our wagon. I had wandered off to smell some flowers outside another shop, when the boys started hurling insults and chased me through the alley. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa cradled me closer as he sloshed across the muddy path. My burlap cloak scraped against my bare shoulders where my dress had been torn. “I’m taking you to the doctor,” he said. “Am I dying?” “No, Helena. You’re not dying.” “After we’re done – I want to see him.” “I’ll think on it. Lie still.” He laid me down on the hay in the bed of our wagon, pushing aside the pumpkins and squash 17 he had purchased to make room. I heard Papa’s horse, Royale, snort his readiness from the front. Soon we were rolling and jostling along the dusty road, so much smoother than the hills outside our distant cottage. So smooth … And I was so scarred. 18 2. I still felt pain, stinging my stomach and face and between my legs, as I lay on the cot in the visiting room. But Doctor Renoire had cleaned me with soft cloths and lotion that took away most of the soreness. Soonafter, I had been able to sit up and eat some of the crackers he kept in his house. He and Papa had left me alone to rest. I laid there as I had been told. Until I heard them talking out in the parlor. I slid down from the cot, wincing at new aches knifing into my thighs and lower back. My 19 ripped, muddy dress had been thrown away. I now wore a pair of boy’s trousers and a shirt, which Doctor Renoire had borrowed from his son’s wardrobe. Only one item had been rescued, and lay on the table beside the cot. My burlap cloak. At least the dark bloodstain in the center gave it some color. I pulled it about my shoulders and hobbled to the door, the wooden floor chilling my bare feet. I peered through the crack and listened. Papa leaned forward in a chair, burying his face in his hands. Doctor Renoire kept a hand on his shoulder. “Relax, Henri,” he said. “Helena’s going to be all right.” Papa sat up and wiped away tears. “This is why. This is why we don’t come out any more. Why we can’t.” “Because of her face?” “No. Not exactly. I just don’t want her suffering any more harm.” My cloak scraped my bruised forearm as I draped it tighter about myself. Doctor Renoire stared at the floorboards. “When Father Vestille brought her in last spring – I had never seen anything like it. At least, not anyone who survived. And certainly no child.” My breath grew quick and shallow. My skin bristled at the memories that still filled my nightmares. The wolf that spoke to me in the forest, that killed Grand’Mere Marie and tried to kill me. The wolf that was anything but a wolf. 20 Doctor Renoire knelt before my father. “Perhaps it’s distasteful to say, but you really should be so grateful, Henri. Just grateful to have her.” “I know. We are. That’s why we can’t let her go out. Not until we can know this won’t happen again.” My foot shuffled against the floor. They both turned. I opened the door slowly as if I had just arrived. Papa quickly wiped his face. “Helena. How do you feel?” “A little better.” “Come here, Helena,” Doctor Renoire beckoned, still kneeling. I limped toward him, feeling some of my strength returning. “That’s it. Good girl. You’re walking fine. You just need to rest up for a few days. Your father agreed to let you skip some chores the next few weeks while you recover. But you should be up and around in no time. Nothing seems to be broken and you’re already moving around much better.” They smiled. They seemed to be waiting for me to respond in kind, so I smiled back. “You know, Helena,” Doctor Renoire continued. “I’ve never seen a girl recover so quickly. You survived six months ago and again today. You’re fortunate to be alive, both times. You’re a true miracle.” My smile faded. “I don’t feel like a miracle.” 21 I clutched at my sore ribs as we trudged through the leaves littering the cobblestone street. I was eager to barter for a new dress at the village clothier and return the trousers that felt so strange, clinging to my legs and exposing them in public. We rarely visited the brick shops and stone houses of La Rue Sauvage. It seemed aptly named now: “Wild Street”. I had begged Papa to take me with him today, but he would never allow it again. Perhaps my parents were right to keep me close to home, never venturing too far outside. Where the wolf might be waiting. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa said nothing at first. “You need to rest. We came to the village. That should be enough excitement for one day, don’t you think?” I heard laughter and flinched. A few men strolled by in front of us, chuckling. Not Jacque Denue or his friends. “I want to see Francois. Please, Papa.” He sighed. “I’ll think on it. Let’s focus on finding a new dress.” We arrived at the clothier and stepped up onto its stoop. The store sign suddenly flipped over to show it now closed as the front door slammed. Papa held my hand and stood in the empty street, staring at the shop door. The sign above the door read: Clothier de Denue. I never knew Jacque’s father sold clothes. He must have heard about what happened. Now he wouldn’t speak to us, out of shame. Or fear. Papa’s hand tightened on mine. His moustache twitched as he clenched his jaw, before 22 he turned me away from the closed door. “Come on, Helena.” I glanced back at the shop. An eye peered out from a crack in the window shutter. Then it disappeared. “We’re not getting a dress?” “Your mother can make you a quick one, perhaps by tomorrow. We’ll ask Doctor Renoire to let us keep these clothes another week. We’re going to see Francois.” My heart soared. “Oh, thank you, Papa!” I nearly threw my arms around him. Then I slowed myself to hug him without upsetting the pain in my ribs. He knew I needed to visit Francois, especially today. Sometimes Francois was the only person who could make me feel safe. Especially when I remembered the wolf. Papa marched to the wagon without a word. He studied the noonday sun. He never let me travel all the way from La Rue Sauvage to Francois’ cabin this late in the day, for fear of being out after dark. He never felt anything was worth that risk. We had to hurry. I tightened my burlap cloak against a draft, scraping my bruises. I glanced back at the shop to see the eye staring at me again before it vanished. Jacque Denue’s father was smart to stay hidden. Papa was no coward. But why didn’t he even knock on the door when we both knew Monsieur Denue was there? Why didn’t he kick the door open and make him give me a new dress for the way his son treated me? Why wouldn’t anyone help me? 23 3. As our wagon rolled up the muddy path to his cabin, I spotted Francois chopping wood outside and smiled. I loved watching his strong arms hammer down on a log with his silver ax. He was a burly man with a round belly and a scraggly beard that crinkled up in a grin whenever he saw me. A wave of warm sunshine bathed me from inside. For the first time since I saw him last month, I felt as though nothing could harm me. Papa tugged Royale to a stop. I wanted to scramble down from the wagon without waiting 24 for permission. But the pain in my side and my legs nearly slowed me to a halt. “Easy, Helena,” Papa said. I hobbled over to Francois as fast as I could, ready for him to scoop me up into his broad arms like always. He thumped his ax into the wood and hurried to me with a fat smile. “Well, well, Helena! What brings you all the way out here?” he boomed. He frowned upon seeing me limp and the pants I now wore. “What happened?” I started to tell him, but I couldn’t. I fell against him and wept, letting my itchy cloak fall to the mud. He hoisted me into the air, but didn’t swing me around in a big circle. Instead, he cradled me like a bear holding a tiny cub. I nuzzled against his warm chest, covered with wooden chips and dust. He patted my back and hugged me. With his heavy arms, who needed a cloak? “It’s all right, Mademoiselle. It’s all right.” “Some boys in the village,” I blubbered. “They chased me and hit me and wouldn’t stop.” “Andre Denue’s son and some of his friends,” Papa said, striding up from behind. “He wouldn’t even open his door to let us buy a new dress. These are from Doctor Renoire’s son.” I sniffed and swiped a tear from my cheek, brushing one of my triple scars. “They called me a monster.” Francois’ hands clenched against my back, then relaxed. “You’re no monster. You just had some bad luck, that’s all. Don’t pay no attention to 25 those morons. Sounds to me like a bunch of no-good bullies.” “I wish you’d been there. Papa let them get away.” Francois held me a moment longer. Then he gently set me down and knelt before me. His eyes looked worried. “Now listen, Helena. If I’d been there, I couldn’t have done anything more than what your father did.” I glanced back to see Papa staring at the ground. I started to tremble. I never meant to dishonor him. I just wanted someone to protect me. Francois’ large finger turned my chin back toward him. “I’m betting your father took you straight to the doctor, didn’t he? And you’re here in one piece. Aren’t you? I expect he was more concerned about treating your wounds than getting revenge.” My face screwed up with tears again. I fell against Francois and sobbed. Ashamed of the way I had spoken about Papa. Angry at Jacque Denue and his friends for nearly beating me to death. And terrified of facing them – or anyone – again. Afraid of showing my horrid face. “Helena. Your cloak,” Papa said. I turned. He held the burlap cloak out to me. I took it with a faint smile, then draped it back in place, careful to keep it from scraping my shoulders too much. Francois patted my back. “Dry your tears now. I’m glad you came today. Been wanting to 26 show you something, next time I saw you. Come on back.” He wiped my eyes with the tail of his thick tunic. I smeared away the rest with the back of my fist. He led me like a lamb, his large hand around my shoulder, toward the rear of his stable. I smiled, eager to see Francois’ ebony horse, Lightning, named for the jagged stripe that covered her nose. I always felt better after petting her. As we came around the corner, Lightning lifted her head lazily. A colt jerked its head from beneath her. It rose to face us, stamping its hooves in protest. Its flanks were red like flame. I gaped. “What’s that?” “That,” he said, “is our new colt.” Its blazing eyes locked on mine. “She’s red!” I squealed. My cloak fell off my shoulders again as I hobbled forward. “Whoa! Stop!” Francois shouted as Papa also yelled behind him. I limped to the gate as fast as I could. The fiery colt reared back, then ran at me. “Helena!” Papa cried. Francois tugged me back as the colt stamped and kicked at the gate. “Easy now, that colt’s a wild one. Understand? Don’t move too quick around it, you’ll pay for it.” I stared into the colt’s eyes. It did look dangerous, but that seemed all right somehow. It didn’t seem mean, just frightened and ready to fight. The same way I felt, except I didn’t have 27 hooves to kick against a gate. “Let me give her some oats.” “Helena …” Papa started. “I don’t know, Helena,” Francois said. “It’s still a little fired up.” “I can do it. I’ll be careful.” After a silent moment, Papa nodded to Francois. “All right, if you walk up with her.” Francois led me to the feed bag hanging outside the stable. He dug out a handful of oats and emptied some into my hand. “Now you let me go first,” he said. We stepped toward the colt, slow and steady. It watched our every move, looking curious, as I hobbled forward with a smile. Francois opened his hand and extended it beneath the colt’s mouth. The colt snorted and tossed its head. Then it bent, sniffed, and nibbled like one of Papa’s sheep. “See, she’s sweet,” I said. I lifted my open palm with my oats, careful not to startle the colt. It stared at me for several seconds. Then it nibbled from my hand. It tickled. When all the oats were gone, it buried his nose in my hand and nuzzled. I took a step closer, moving slow and gentle. It gave a low snort from somewhere in its belly, as a warning. I smiled and took another small step. It let me edge closer. Then I gently curved my hand around to stroke its jaw, and it relaxed. It took a half-step closer and bent its head to let me pet it. I laid my head against the colt and hugged it with both arms. “She likes me.” “Would you look at that?” Francois said, sounding surprised. “But ‘she’ is a ‘he’.” 28 “How do you know?” “Just trust me, all right? So. Now you’ve got him settled, what do you think we should name him?” My eyes lit up. “Crimson. His whole flank is crimson like fire.” It was my favorite word for red. Papa’s face wrinkled at that as he held my burlap cloak. Though he looked more pained than offended. “Then ‘Crimson’ it is,” Francois said, petting the colt as he grew calmer. “And you can help me take care of him.” I looked up at him. “I can? You mean it?” “You come out as often as you like, Helena. When you’re older, I’ll teach you to ride him.” My heart raced. Women rode in carriages, not on horses, and I had never heard of a girl learning how to ride. I leaned against him and threw my arms around his belly, squeezing him tight. “Thank you. Thank you, Francois.” He turned toward Papa, licking his lips. “If it’s all right with your father, that is.” I looked back. “Can I, Papa?” Papa looked pale. He wrung the burlap cloak in his hands. “We’ll see. When you’re a little older.” I hobbled to Papa and fell onto him in a tight hug. I limped back to Crimson, who continued to study my awkward movements, and petted him again. He leaned his head down and 29 stared at me as though we could see into one another’s souls. 30 4. Crimson lifted his head and snorted. I released him as another horse whinnied in the distance. I hobbled toward Papa to peer around the corner of Francois’ stable. A beautiful black coach was rolling across the muddy path to the cabin. Papa’s voice rose. “Were you expecting Duke Laurent?” Francois arrived behind us. “Last person I’d be expecting out here. ‘Course, I didn’t expect to see you today, either.” 31 Duke Laurent ruled the province, but he and Papa had become good friends. He always gave me the most delicious apples and pears whenever he visited Papa. He made me feel almost as safe as Francois. As the adorned coach drew closer, I spotted a gray Palomino trotting behind it amidst the falling leaves. I smiled, recognizing the black cloak and hat of its rider. “Or Father Vestille?” Papa asked. Francois craned his neck forward and gaped. “Next to last person I’d expect. Unless he’s short on confessions. I’m sure I could fill his plate, if he’s feeling lonely.” Papa lowered his chin. “Show respect, Francois.” Francois raised his hands. “Sorry.” Father Vestille didn’t always make me feel safe, but he always smiled and bent down to listen to me after the Sunday Mass. When I was little, he let me sit on his lap whenever he came to visit us. Every time I talked with him, I completely forgot about my scars. The royal coach arrived first. I watched closely as the driver stepped down from his perch to open the rear door. I always felt proud knowing Papa was friends with the Duke of La Rue Sauvage himself. Duke Laurent jumped down and nodded his thanks to the driver, then gaped at us with wide eyes. He ran to Papa, ignoring the mud that splattered on the fine wool-lined coat Mama had made for him. “Henri, are you both all right? I 32 heard there was some trouble in the village. Doctor Renoire said you went home, but we saw the tracks leading here.” Papa shook his hand. “She’s all right. Doctor Renoire said she just needs to rest.” Duke Laurent regarded me with pitiful golden-brown eyes, which made him look even more handsome. He knelt before me, kissing both my hands as if I was a princess. “Helena. I’m so glad you’re all right.” “I am. It still hurts, though.” “I’m sure it does. But you’ll get well. Just rest, like your father says, and you’ll be up and about in no time.” “Monsieur,” Papa said. “May I introduce Francois Revelier?” The Duke stood as Papa and Francois bowed their heads. “The man who saved Helena last year?” He took a step back to view Francois’ full height and size. “Such bravery should not go unnoticed. If I were back at the court in Versailles, you would receive a medal for protecting one of our precious citizens. I can’t provide that, but I believe a banquet in your honor is long overdue.” My heart leaped as Francois gaped at him. “Well, uh – thank you. Your Majesty. Er, Your Grace.” The Duke smiled. “You may call me ‘Monsieur’. Or ‘Leopold’, if you prefer.” Francois shook his hand. “Think it’ll have to be ‘Monsieur’. Wouldn’t feel right using the first name of royalty.” 33 “I’m not all that royal anymore,” Duke Laurent joked. “Any news from the King?” Papa asked. The Duke’s face fell. He glanced down at me, then back at Papa, spreading his hands. “He still refuses to answer my letters. I’ve tried, Henri. I can implore him to send some men, but – .” “I know,” Papa said. “You have no authority with Versailles.” Duke Laurent shrugged and shook his head. “The perils of losing favor with the royal court. I’m fortunate to be given oversight here. I only wish I could provide better security for --.” He glanced down at me and stopped himself. “… for our province.” Papa heaved a sigh. “We need soldiers, Monsieur Laurent. There must be someone we can appeal to. Someone to make the King see reason.” “I’m afraid the only one who can change the mind of the King toward me and our province is the King. I’ve asked. I’ve pleaded. I’ve begged.” His eyes burrowed into the ground. “I don’t even know whether they open my appeals or if they immediately discard them upon seeing my name.” Papa whirled away with clenched fists. He unclenched them quickly as Father Vestille strode toward us, the sun glinting off of his bald head. “Abier, how are you?” Papa said, shaking hands. “You know Francois, of course.” Father Vestille nodded to Francois. “Of course.” Francois smiled, with less than his usual warmth. “Well, we’re not on a first name basis.” 34 “Perhaps we should be,” Father Vestille said. “I haven’t even spoken to you since --. Well, since Spring.” He glanced at me the same way Duke Laurent had. As if I didn’t remember what Francois did for me this past spring. He knelt before me with open arms. I hugged him tight. “What are you doing here?” “I heard there was a commotion in the village. I came to see you.” He lowered his chin, his forehead creasing with worry. “Are you all right?” I nodded, feeling better. Safer, even. “I saw you weren’t at home, so I followed the tracks here. I told Celeste I would find you both. I, ah –.” He raised his eyebrows at Papa. “I didn’t tell her anything else. Figured you’d want to share that.” Papa nodded. “Thank you.” “Did you hear what happened?” I asked. “Doctor Renoire found me and told me about it. I’ll have a talk with Andre Denue tomorrow, see if I can find out who the other boys were,” he said, more to Papa than to me. “Are you going to excommunicate Monsieur Denue?” I asked, hopeful. “Or Jacque?” Father Vestille blinked. “I don’t think I’ll need to do that, Helena. I would rather give them both a chance to make amends.” “But they beat me. And they wouldn’t stop. You have to do something.” 35 “I will. I plan to talk to every one of them about what they’ve done. And help them understand the wrong of it.” I shook my head. “That won’t help. You need to punish them, to make sure they can’t do it again. You have to hurt them the way they hurt me. You should –!” “Helena,” Papa interrupted with a scowl. “That’s enough.” “Yes, leave the punishments to me, Helena,” Duke Laurent broke in. “After all, maintaining order is the role of government. Not the church.” Father Vestille looked sideways at the Duke and frowned. “Yes, that is true. Tell me, what is being done about these occasional – attacks?” “All that the King will allow, which isn’t much, I’m afraid. As far as France is concerned, we’re on our own.” Father Vestille wrinkled his brow. “So the King plans to let La Rue Sauvage fend for itself? He refuses to lift a finger to help us?” “Your words, not mine, Father,” Duke Laurent replied. Father Vestille stepped toward him, looking annoyed, as Papa moved between them. I fidgeted, eager to avoid their argument. “I want to see Crimson again,” I told Francois. “Sure thing,” Francois boomed. “Right this way. We’ll let these gentlemen continue their civil conversation on their own.” He cast an amused 36 glance over his shoulder, and I saw Papa sour at him as we trudged to the rear of the stable. Crimson stood by the gate and lifted his head as we returned, still focused on me. I limped back to the feed bag to give him some more oats. “It’s all right, Crimson. Just Papa talking with Duke Laurent and Father Vestille. Nothing to be afraid of.” I watched the oats disappear from my hand as he nibbled. My sides still ached, but I felt numb inside. Numb and helpless, with no one to protect me from Jacque Denue and his friends. Or from anything else. “Francois? How often do you get scared?” “I dunno. Now and then. Everybody gets scared sometimes.” I stroked Crimson’s flank. “I feel like I’m scared all the time.” He didn’t answer right away. “What’re you scared of?” “That the wolf might come back.” He shuffled his feet in the grass. “Hard to come back if he’s dead.” I pictured its horrible image again. Its monstrous head. Its jagged ears. Its fanged smile. “I heard there were other attacks. Didn’t the wolf kill some other people, too?” Francois paced to one side, then back toward me. “That was before. Figure it was that same wolf. Sure, there have been other attacks, by wolves or some other animals. But you don’t need to worry about that big, bad wolf anymore. He’s gone forever.” 37 “Were you scared when you killed him?” “‘Course I was. But sometimes there are things more important than being scared. Things you’ve got to stand up and fight for.” “Like trying to save Grand’Mere?” “Yeah. And looking after you. I mean, if I hadn’t gone in after that wolf – well, he would’ve gotten you, too. Can’t let being scared stop you from doing what’s right. If everybody stays scared, who’s gonna protect us?” I knew he was right. But the wolf was monstrous. And I was just a girl that older boys beat on. “Francois. Can you teach me to fight?” His eyes bulged. “Uhhh, now why would you want to learn that, Helena?” I cocked my head at him. “You know why. So I can beat up Jacque Denue instead of him beating on me.” He frowned. “I’m not sure that’s the answer to your problem, Helena. Certainly not the answer your father would give you.” “That’s why I’m asking you. You know how to stand up and fight. You knew how to kill that wolf.” He scratched his beard. “Yeah, well. Funny thing, that whole business. I didn’t strike it that hard, you know? I just got lucky. That big old wolf must have been tired or sick or something, because I barely grazed it. It died a few seconds after I struck it.” I blinked. “I thought you chopped its head off.” 38 “That was after he died. Didn’t want to take any chances with a wolf that big. But – well, anyway. Fighting’s not the answer. Not for a young girl like you.” “So I just have to get beat up?” He pressed his lips tight, then sighed heavily at the ground. He crouched beside me, his voice dropping to a low whisper. “All right, come here. Look. The thing about any fight is, not so much getting in your licks at the other guy, as making sure he doesn’t get anything on you.” I squinted. “Huh?” “I mean, don’t tire yourself out. If he swings at you with his right, you step aside and let him miss. When he swings again, you step back or to the side again. Sooner or later, he’ll tire himself out trying to hit you.” “And then you flatten him,” I said, excited. He half-smiled. “Well, yeah. But the same thing. Don’t tire yourself out. Look, you’re a girl. Boys are gonna be stronger than you most of the time, right? So don’t just use your fists.” He leaned toward the corner of the stable and listened to make sure the others were still talking. Then he crouched and spoke even softer. “Grab a stick. Or a brick. Or a rock. Or anything you can use to lay him flat.” My stomach churned at the thought of a brick smashing into Jacque Denue’s face. “I don’t want to kill him.” “Then don’t hit him where you’ll kill him. Just hit him hard enough in the knee or the gut that he won’t think of bothering you again. All right?” 39 I nodded, satisfied. “All right.” “And, uh – .” He glanced back to the side again. “Don’t tell your father we had this talk. Think it’s better that way.” I smiled. “Me, too.” He nodded, pressing his hands on his knees to rise. Then he bent back down. “Listen, Helena. If you ever run into trouble – real trouble – and I’m not around, I want you to look up a friend of mine in the village. Name’s Gerard Touraine. He’ll look after you.” I nodded. “Gerard Touraine. All right.” He glanced back at the corner of the stable. We heard Papa still talking with the others. “All right, let me show you how to look after yourself.” He stood a little, his hands on his knees as he bent over me. He made a fist. “If someone comes at you like this, see, you step sideways out of the way. That’s it. Hey, even hobbling around, it’s easier to move without a dress, ain’t it? Now while he’s swinging hard and hitting air, he’s off-balance. See that? See how I’m ready to fall forward? So you knuckle both your fists together and swing hard on his back to carry him the rest of the way. He’ll plant his face in the mud. Or he’ll double over and you can bring your knee up hard to his jaw. Got me? But you gotta know how to keep from getting hit first, so you can use his own strength against him. Then you just knock him over or punch him in his ribs, hard. That’ll take the wind out of him. Strike hard and fast. The faster you finish it, the less likely he’ll be to mess with you again.” He glanced up as Papa returned, and straightened to 40 his full height. “– and that’s why you should never fight with boys. That’s what I say. So just stay away from those bullies.” He gave a firm nod. Papa smiled at him. “Duke Laurent and Father Vestille have gone home, now that they know you’re safe. Don’t think they see eye-to-eye on many subjects. Helena, it’ll be dark in a few hours. Are you ready to go home?” I smiled at Francois, feeling a new sense of confidence. “Yes. I’m ready.” Francois Revelier had taught me how to fight. I had new hope. 41 5. It was near dark when we pulled up to our cottage. Only a couple of the sheep lay awake bleating in their pen while the rest slept. Papa had driven Royale faster up the path when the air chilled and the sun dipped toward the horizon. The mud had dried, making the ride faster if not smoother. Mama strode onto the front porch to greet us, her hands twisting around a cloth towel as if it needed to be wrung. She looked pale and her eyes 42 were larger than usual. “Henri. You’re so late. What on earth happened?” “Everything’s all right, Celeste,” he promised. “Had an incident in town. Then we went to see Francois.” She squinted through the darkness to see me. To see my face. Her eyes bulged. “Dear –! Come inside. What happened? Did something –? … Come in here and let me clean you up. Henri, tell me what happened.” I hobbled over the hard ground to Mama. She held me against her as we moved indoors. She led me straight through the front kitchen and off to my room at the back of the house, then helped me lay down on my bed. It felt good to finally rest. Though I dreaded sleep, especially after today. She unlaced my shoes, caked with dry mud, and pulled them off as Papa came in. “Some boys in the village beat her. I took her to Doctor Renoire. He loaned us his son’s clothes for a while, ‘til next time we return to the village.” “Well, you’ll go alone next time. She’s not going back to that village.” Her voice and face grew tight. “I know. Never should’ve agreed to take her in the first place.” “Yes, you should,” I said. “I can’t stay inside forever, Papa. Sooner or later, I’ve got to stand up.” “Hush now,” Mama said, stroking my forehead. “Henri, get a basin of water.” 43 Papa left without a word. “I have to stand up, Mama,” I repeated. “You need to lie down.” “No. I have to stand up to them. I have to fight.” “Hush. Just keep far away from those boys.” I stared at her, marveling at her perfect appearance and poise. Her auburn hair up in a beautiful bun with ringlets dangling about her ears. Her homespun dress – she was an amazing seamstress – rising from her shoulders in shapely curves, its intricate pattern decorating her slim arms and wrists. Her face peaceful and soft, even when flushed with anger. “Mama? Am I a monster?” Her eyes flared. “What on earth would make you think that?” “That’s what those boys said. That’s why they beat me. Because I’m so ugly.” She gaped at me as if I had burned down our cottage. “If that’s why they beat you, it’s those boys who are ugly monsters.” A tear slid around my cheek as I admired her features. “I wish I were pretty like you.” She nearly lunged at me, scooping me into her tight embrace. Papa hurried in with the water basin, but slowed and set it down gently when he saw us hugging. “Helena, you are pretty,” Mama said. “Not to boys, I’m not.” “You don’t need to worry about boys just now. You’re a beautiful girl. And you have a 44 beautiful heart. Someday, when you’re much older, you’ll meet a boy who sees that.” Papa glanced sharply at us. Then he focused on soaking a rag in the water. He didn’t like for me to talk about boys at all, even with Mama. “The boys in town think I’m a monster. Except for Pierre.” Mama trembled against me. “Well, he’s a nice boy, at least. You can forget about the others. Now let’s get you cleaned up.” Papa slid the basin closer and Mama helped me remove the boy’s tunic and trousers. She cleaned every bruise and cut, put fresh bandages over a few of them, then dried me off and helped me dress in my nightgown. “Say your prayers,” she said. I knelt carefully beside my bed as they stood watch. My back and side and one knee still ached horribly. I made the sign of the cross over myself and folded my blistered hands. “Dear Lord, please bless and secure our home. Protect us and lead us. Bless our province. Bless Francois and Father Vestille and Duke Laurent, and help the King see that we need help. Heal me and help me sleep through the night. Amen.” I rose slowly, pulled back the covers and climbed into bed. Papa hung his head and tightened his fists as Mama kissed my forehead. “I love you, Helena,” she said, her voice strained. “Sweet dreams.” They stepped out and shut the door, encasing me in blackness. 45 Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares. I wandered through the flowery meadow outside our home and on into the dark canopy of the woods. My little basket swung at my side. I smiled at the red hooded cloak surrounding me, the one Grand’Mere had made, warding off the early morning chill. My cheeks were rosy and free of scars. I listened close in the darkness of the pine trees, shuddering. Within the whistling wind, I could hear its voice. Where are you going, little girl? I started to run. Through the woods, past shrubs and towering trees and scurrying animals. The forest grew denser, until I felt it might close in on me. I scoured every direction for the source of the growling voice but saw nothing. So nice to see you again, little girl. My heart pounded. I ran faster. I stumbled, but rose to my feet and raced on. The voice grew louder. I can see you, little Helena. I’m coming after you … I emerged from the woods, from the heavy strangle of trees, into the broad meadow outside Grand’Mere Marie’s cottage. I had to warn her. I ran to her door and pounded on it, stealing glances over my shoulder. The woods remained still and quiet, but the voice persisted from somewhere. Helena. I’m coming for you … 46 I heard snoring. At the neighboring cottage, the window shutter hung open. I could see Francois’ large frame, asleep on his cot, his giant belly rising and falling. Ah, there you are, Helena. I spun around. In a stream of fog at the edge of the dark forest, the black wolf stood tall, its blue-gray eyes shining brightly. I twisted the doorknob and ran inside. I slammed the door shut with both hands, then swung the bolt down to lock it. I turned to find Grand’Mere. There on her bed, something shuffled in the sheets. The black wolf had already gotten inside somehow, circling among Grand’Mere’s nightgown and cap, now soaked in blood. I gasped and fell against the door. The beast fixed its ghostly eyes on me. Its voice rasped low and cruel. “Come in, little girl. Come see your Grand’Mere.” The same wolf that had padded close to me in the woods, keeping its distance but calling out until I answered. Until I told it I was going to my Grand’Mere’s house, and to leave me alone. Instead, it had raced ahead to devour her. The wolf jumped down from the bloody bed and padded across the cherrywood floor toward me. It stood – stood – on its hind legs, grinning. I hurled my basket at its face. It scraped the beast’s nose and bounced off. The wolf arched its eyebrows, its blue-gray eyes widening. It lifted its paw, extending sharp claws, then swiped at me as I screamed. 47 Everything fell black. My skin felt clammy, my nightgown drenched with sweat. I sat straight up in bed, feeling the soreness in my back as I stared into the pitch darkness. Something stomped hard across the floorboards. Then a faint light peeked beneath my door. Mama came in. Papa followed her, bearing a lantern. Mama rushed to my side and cradled me. “Helena, you’re all right. It’s just a bad dream.” I clung to her, feeling numb. I stared at Papa’s lantern, the only source of light. “It spoke again,” I said. “Hush, Helena,” she told me. “It was just a bad dream. Wolves can’t speak.” I let her rock me back and forth, back and forth. They never believed me, any more than Father Vestille or Francois had when they brought me to Doctor Renoire. They assumed I was hysterical and babbling in my delirium. I closed my eyes to shut out the nightmare. But my mind saw the wolf’s leering grin. Heard its guttural voice. “Where’s my cloak?” I asked. They said nothing. I opened my eyes. Papa straightened, his posture rigid. “It’s put away.” “Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. It’s mine.” In the pale light of his high lantern, Papa’s dark moustache formed a thick frown. “Your burlap cloak will keep you warm enough. And it won’t attract attention.” 48 A wolf howled in the distance. My body tensed in a spasm as Mama tightened her hold. Papa rushed to the shuttered window. He stood there, his back to me. For a moment, I thought he would throw open the shutter, to see if the wolf was lurking right outside. I expected him to leap through the window in one bound, race into the forest, find the wolf, and strangle it with his bare hands. He only stood there, listening. The wolf’s howls rose, rattling my nerves as though it lived inside me. Papa stared at the closed shutter. “You can sleep in our bed again tonight,” he said. 49 6. The sun broke through the clouds to shine down on our lost sheep. Drawn to the blooming purple flowers, it had wandered down the slope, near the cliff’s edge. “There she is!” Papa tugged on Royale’s reins as he held up a hand to the rest of us. Our border collie, Valiant, barked beneath him. Pierre pulled his horse, Diamond, to a jarring halt. His arm snaked around my back to keep me from falling off, pressing me closer against him. His father, Monsieur Leóne, followed 50 suit and stopped Ruby, who shifted awkwardly beneath his weight. The four of us paused at the crest of the hill, at the edge of the forest. I clung to Pierre’s warm back, the best protection against the biting cold. The broad grassland below was bathed in sunshine, lush and green and deadly. We saw where our sheep had broken through some taller grass and nibbled its way near the cliff. Beyond its rim, the distant mountains stood guard in a hazy mist. I could barely make out the well-girded wooden bridge that connected them, as it disappeared in the fog halfway across. “Careful now,” Papa said. “Don’t scare it.” He started down first, leading Royale step by step, careful not to stumble. Valiant padded obediently beside him. I peered around Pierre at a huge hole in the ground, that looked as though some giant had taken a bite out of the hill. I hoped Papa and Valiant wouldn’t fall into it. I pressed myself closer, giving Pierre a gentle hug. “Thank you for holding on to me,” I said. “No problem, Red,” he whispered back. I smiled. “You know I can’t wear my cloak anymore, Pierre.” I didn’t count the burlap shawl as a cloak, as I pulled it closer about my shoulders. I had just turned eight years old, but I still wasn’t allowed to wear anything too bright outside. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll always be ‘Red’ to me.” Pierre was the only one who still called me ‘Red’. I had worn that scarlet hooded cloak 51 everywhere, even indoors, for two straight years. I had swept into every room, beaming as the cape fanned out behind me. Wrapped inside it, I always felt as if nothing could harm me. No degree of cold, no sad news, no fears. I felt the same way whenever Pierre called me ‘Red’. Papa and Valiant drew closer and closer to the sheep. It seemed to take forever. I wanted to jump down from Diamond’s back, rush down the hill and scoop it up myself. But, as Papa often reminded me, I needed to learn patience. My foot shook back and forth against Diamond’s flank with anticipation. Diamond whinnied, annoyed. “Helena, stop!” Pierre whispered. “Sorry.” The sheep jerked its head up at the sound. Papa stopped Royale and waited, neither he nor Valiant moving. The sheep finally returned to its grazing. Papa turned slowly to look up the hill at us. I swallowed, feeling my cheeks burn. He continued down, one hoof at a time, as the sheep nibbled at the grassy slope. I stared again at the giant hole. “What’s that?” I whispered. Pierre leaned back to my ear. “Probably left over from the war, when everyone started invading. People had to find all sorts of places to hide away. This must be one somebody dug out.” I pressed against his back, pulling him tight. “Mama told me we had to hide when I was a baby. She wouldn’t tell me anything else about it, though. But I remember looking up and seeing a wide door open above me. There was a big ramp 52 with steps leading out into the sun. I think I was only three years old.” Diamond shuffled his feet and whinnied again. Papa turned sharply and looked right at me. I shrank back behind Pierre. Papa continued down the slope and pulled Royale to a stop, about fifteen feet from the sheep. He clicked his tongue at Valiant, who moved around the animal to stand between it and the cliff’s edge. He barked and the sheep jolted upright, bleating. Valiant barked louder, moving toward it. The sheep shuffled toward Papa, who led Royale behind the sheep to guide it up the hill. We would have no trouble leading it home now. “Come on down,” he called to us. “Let’s take a rest.” He climbed down and took some jerky from his saddle pouch. We descended slowly with Monsieur Leóne and the horses. “What’s that bridge near the mountains?” I asked. “Leads out of the province,” Pierre said. “Across the gorge, then through the mountains. Eventually, if you keep going, you get to the royal palace in Versailles.” “That would be exciting, to see the palace.” Pierre shrugged. “I hear the King’s corrupt.” “Who says that?” “My father. He says the King won’t talk to Duke Laurent at all. We get no support from the court. The Duke keeps asking them to send soldiers here, but the King won’t even answer his letters.” 53 “I heard Papa talking about that with the Duke in the Fall, when he told Francois about the banquet. I wish you could come. We’ve been waiting for it all winter.” He shrugged again. “Only rich people there, besides you and your parents. Heard they invited a couple of people Francois knows, but it’s mostly the Duke’s friends. Think he’s trying to impress everyone with a show.” “You think so?” I asked, concerned. “It’s what royal people do. They don’t necessarily do anything to help, just make it look like they’re doing something. I think the party’s more for the Duke to look good than to honor Francois.” I considered that, then waved it off. “That may be. But the Duke’s not like other royal people.” “True,” Pierre said. “If everyone at the court were like him, we’d probably have those soldiers by now.” “Why do we need soldiers?” He stopped Diamond and turned in his seat, narrowing his eyes at me. They were brown and beautiful beneath his shaggy dirt-blond hair. He could have told me anything right then and I would have sat on his horse and listened for hours. “Because of the wolf,” he said. A lump gathered in my throat. Riding with Pierre through the mountains and rolling hills after being penned up at our cottage these last two months, I had forgotten about the wolf today. “Oh,” I said. 54 “You and your Grand’Mere weren’t the only ones attacked, Red. Other people have been killed over the years. And people are still being killed. But no one’s seen this other wolf in time to stop it. We need soldiers to find it and kill it, so it’ll be safe again.” Safe again. The idea sounded so strange to me. I couldn’t imagine any number of soldiers making me feel safe in La Rue Sauvage. “Do you miss your mother?” I asked. I wanted to change the subject. It was easier to talk about Pierre’s grief than my own. He swiped at his thick hair, showing his forehead for an instant. “Sure. ‘Course I do.” He bit his lip. “But we’ve been pretty busy. Papa’s teaching me all there is to know about smelting and making tools and pots. He tells me I’ve got the skill for it, as much as he did when he was my age. Thinks I’ll make a great blacksmith some day.” Diamond shifted to one side as Pierre maneuvered him past some holes in the side of the hill. I leaned forward and clung tighter to Pierre. “I think so, too,” I told him. “Easy there,” Monsieur Leóne called to both of us, his belly shifting from side to side as he led Ruby down the foothill. “It’s steep. Don’t want to tumble off the edge.” “Yes, Papa,” Pierre said. Below him, Papa stood chewing his jerky. “Everyone all right? Frayne, thanks for spotting her.” Valiant barked as if in agreement. Papa gave him a biscuit from his pouch. 55 “Thought it looked like yours,” Monsieur Leóne said, struggling to climb down. “Next moment, it was gone. Can’t believe it wandered this far so quickly.” He swiped at thin strands of hair falling over his face, the same way Pierre often did. “Just glad I could do something to help.” Papa squatted and brushed some brambles off the sheep’s wool. “Looks like it fell down a hill or two. Good thing it found plenty of grass to nibble on here, before it rolled into the ravine. Sit down. We’ll head back in a minute.” We sat in the grass, chewing on jerky and biscuits and enjoying the fresh air and billowing clouds. I spotted a distant path around the left side of the mountain, far ahead. I stood and walked toward it as Valiant scampered after me, yapping. Papa stood and almost choked on his biscuit. “Helena! Come back from the cliff!” “I’m not near the edge. Look, there’s a road down here.” Someone had built a path around the side of the mountain. It sloped down and gradually worked its way back up to join the broad dirt path leading to the bridge and out of the province. “I said, come back,” Papa repeated. I stuck my fists on my hips. “Papa, I can take care of myself. Don’t you remember I’m eight now?” “You’ve been eight for a week,” he said. He finished chewing and climbed back onto Royale. “And we’ve stayed long enough already. Let’s head home before it gets dark.” 56 My heart sank. I knelt to scratch Valiant behind the ears. “Papa, it’s a beautiful day. Can’t we ride a little farther?” “I let you come along because you wanted to help and you wanted to see Pierre, and I figured it’s just as well to know where you are. We’ve had a nice rest, but it’s time to get back home. Come along.” He nudged Royale’s flanks and started a quick trot up the hill. Monsieur Leóne followed suit with Ruby. “Sorry, Red,” Pierre said. “It’s so pretty here.” I stared out at the endless mountain range beyond the bridge, shrouded in fog and mystery. I didn’t mind the moist chill on my shoulders, if it meant being free to roam outside, beyond our meadow, even for a little while. I found myself staring through the haze at the bridge leading out of La Rue Sauvage. It lay just beyond the wide green plateau that stretched away on both sides and ended in two points, resembling a large sleeping crocodile. Pierre mounted Diamond and bent to offer his hand. I took it and climbed up behind him. We turned slowly from the inviting scene. Pierre took his time leaving, knowing how much I wanted to stay. He was giving me every second he could. “Come on, Pierre,” Papa called from the crest of the hill. “I thought you said that horse was fast.” There was humor in his voice. I couldn’t remember the last time he sounded happy. “The fastest,” Pierre called back. “Well, prove it! We need to get the sheep settled so we can make it to the banquet.” 57 “Hey, look at that,” Pierre said, inspired. “What?” “There’s a hole down on this end, too.” I looked where he was pointing as Valiant started barking and growling at it. Behind a boulder at our far right, close to the edge, another enormous hole had been dug through the side of the hill, nearly big enough to fit a wagon. “It’s a tunnel.” “Yeah. Leading straight up to the top.” I smiled. “You’re so smart, Pierre.” “Hang on.” He spurred Diamond toward the hole. Diamond snorted and kicked up dirt as Valiant barked and chased after us. I clung tighter to Pierre while Papa and Monsieur Leóne gaped, before breaking into a gallop after us. It must have looked like we were headed over the cliff. Valiant stopped short near the dark passage and fell back, to race up the hill instead. We curved around the boulder and Papa’s frantic image vanished as we descended into the tunnel’s black mouth. The swallowing darkness and cold frightened me for a moment, but I pressed close against Pierre. My eyes adjusted quickly, as light bled in from the other end of the tunnel and from small holes dug into the earth above us. They would be invisible on the surface, but here below they gave extra light and air. Pierre was right about men hollowing out this tunnel for refuge during the war. Diamond’s hooves clomped over several logs that had been buried in the ground to create a partial stairway. 58 Something stirred in the darkness up ahead. A large animal had hunched over something in the center of the tunnel and now raised its head, its eyes flashing on us. Its blue-gray eyes. The wolf growled from somewhere deep in its belly as we rushed past it, its breath forming a white shroud. “Hurry!” I cried. Pierre leaned forward in the saddle, urging Diamond up the dark slope. Behind us, the black wolf watched us go. I heard his mouth smacking on something he was eating. Something he must have dragged down here to finish off. Then he started after us. “Go, Pierre! Faster!” Pierre pushed Diamond harder and we lunged forward. The enormous wolf loped after us in greater strides. It would sink its teeth into us in seconds. “GO!” Light filled the end of the tunnel as it formed a steeper angle, where extra logs had been laid. I felt a touch of the sun’s warmth as we neared the opening. The wolf slowed and skidded to a halt, letting us flee. We burst out of the upper end, my heart pounding as I gasped for breath. “Helena!” Papa thundered, his angry voice bringing a strange sense of calm. “What did you think you were doing?’ Valiant barked and growled at the hole behind us. 59 Monsieur Leóne trotted up to us, his eyes wide beneath his wild, unkempt hair. “Do you realize what might have happened? Who knows what might be in there?” I had never seen him so agitated. Pierre was flustered. “Papa, there was something! There was – !” “Let’s go home!” I interrupted. “We’re really sorry, Papa. Monsieur Leóne. We won’t do it again. Let’s just – Let’s just hurry home so we can get to the banquet.” “But –!” Pierre burst. “Pierre, we made a mistake. We shouldn’t have gone in there. Let’s just go home, all right? Let’s just go home.” He breathed deeply in and out, staring at me in fright. “Helena. What happened?” Papa asked. “We – We almost tripped. On a tree root. Almost fell over. We got scared. That’s all. Let’s all just hurry home and forget about it, all right? Please?” Pierre looked from me to Papa and Monsieur Leóne. He slowed his frantic breathing as Valiant watched the tunnel with a murmuring growl. He stared at me again, then back at the quiet hole. “All right. Let’s forget about it. For now.” “Just don’t try anything so foolish again,” Papa said. “You might both have been killed.” Pierre led Diamond away. I squinted over my shoulder. From deep within the darkness, the blue-gray eyes shone as if studying our every move. 60 7. Papa pulled our wagon up to the front of the tavern. The sign above its hitching post said La Maison de Touraine. We sat for a moment, listening to the raucous men laughing and shouting inside as Papa regarded Mama. She sat rigid, drawing her shawl closer against the evening air, her chin angled up. “I simply can’t understand why it had to be here, of all places. After we waited all winter for the Duke to arrange this. I thought we were supposed to be 61 honoring someone. What’s honorable about surrounding ourselves with a lot of drinking?” They had been silent for most of the ride. At first I thought Papa was still angry at me for riding through the tunnel with Pierre. Then I remembered how Mama felt about alcohol and the place Duke Laurent chose for Francois’ banquet. Besides, I had already promised Papa I would never do it again. And I meant it. I still pictured those blue-gray eyes, shining as they had chased me and Pierre. As they had watched us leave the grassy cliff. Entering that tunnel again would be like jumping into the wolf’s mouth. The tavern’s double doors flew open with a bang and I yelped as two men burst from inside. Their boots clomped across the porch beside the hitching post as they guffawed, one slapping the other on the back. I sighed, quivering. Mama put an arm around me, tugging me close. She frowned at Papa. “Helena doesn’t need to be around men like these. Especially after all that’s happened.” Papa studied me, weighing his decision. “It’s for Francois,” he said. “We won’t stay long.” Mama gave me another strong squeeze, then waited for Papa to hitch up Royale and help her down. He brought me down next. He never swung me in the air anymore, the way Francois did, though I was light enough and my wounds had all mended. Instead, he set me down like I was a porcelain doll. 62 Mama put her hand on my shoulder and we pushed through the large oak double doors. Inside, men roared with laughter and deafening shouts. Some waved their fists in the air as they spoke. I backed into Mama, then clutched her hand with both of mine. This place looked like it could get out of control within seconds. Duke Laurent spotted us from across the room. He strode toward us with open arms, which gave me some assurance. No one could harm us with the Duke standing close by. “Henri! Celeste! So good to see you!” He shook Papa’s hand and kissed Mama’s, then smiled at me. “And how are you today, Helena?” “A bit nervous,” Mama answered for me. “I’m afraid this isn’t the most suitable environment for an eight-year old girl.” Papa put a hand on Mama’s shoulder, too late to quiet her. The Duke’s face fell. “I am so sorry,” he said. “I know Francois frequents this place and I know some men who come here. I thought it would be ideal to recognize his actions. I’m afraid I failed to consider what a difficult position it would put you in.” He gave a little laugh. “Perhaps that is why the royal family places so little faith in me.” “It’s all right, Your Grace,” Papa said. “We’re sure you planned this out as best you could.” Mama’s face softened as she met my eyes. I held her hand more loosely now, feeling safer 63 with the Duke standing between us and the crowd. “Yes, we’re here for Francois, after all,” she said. The Duke kissed Mama’s hand again, bowing lower. “The grace of a Queen. Henri is fortunate to have you, and I’m fortunate to have your forgiveness. Now, please, come in and we’ll find Francois. Ah, Simonet! You have not met Henri’s family. Madame Basque, may I present my chief advisor, Siegfried Simonet. Monsieur Simonet, this is Henri’s wife, Madame Celeste Basque, and their daughter, Helena Basque.” The Duke’s advisor loomed over me, tall, thin and frowning, with stringy black hair that rode down his back like the Duke’s. He regarded me with lazy eyes and gave a disinterested nod. I resisted the urge to flinch. Thankfully, Monsieur Simonet turned from me to shake hands with Papa and nod at Mama. He seemed just as unconcerned with them, and quickly turned to Duke Laurent. “How many more guests do you anticipate?” he asked. “Our guest of honor wants to make certain you are providing enough wine and ale.” The Duke laughed. He turned to spread his arms wide as Francois came thundering toward him. “For our hero, all the wine and ale he wants!” “That’sss what I like to hearrr!” Francois said, stumbling a little as he approached. ‘Most grateful for your hossspitality, Your Highnesss.” I prepared to run toward him, to let him swing me through the air. But Mama’s hand pressed on my shoulder and held me back. 64 Papa stepped forward. “Francois. Good to see you.” “Heyyy,” Francois said, blinking at Papa as if he didn’t recognize him. “Henri. And Celeste.” He turned to me and crouched, pressing his hands over his knees. One fist held a dark half-empty bottle. “And there’s little Helena. How’rrre you, little Mademoissselle?” “Fine,” I said. “Are you all right, Francois?” He waved me off and stood, like an old woman trying to rise from her rocking chair. “‘Courssse. ‘Course I am. Just enjoying this wonderful party the Duke’s giving me, that’s all. After your birthday, it’s jussst been onne party after anothhher.” The Duke winked at me. “He’s fine, Helena.” He smiled at Simonet. “I don’t suppose you’ll indulge yourself with any wine tonight, Simonet?” Simonet maintained his frown. “I prefer to keep myself alert.” Duke Laurent leaned toward Papa. “Simonet is extremely self-disciplined. He’s the closest thing I have to a priest.” I looked about, hopeful to see our actual priest. “Is Father Vestille here?” “I invited him,” Duke Laurent said. “But he declined.” Francois barked out a laugh. “He’s afraid of the beer!” Papa leaned close to the Duke as Francois continued to laugh louder. “He’s visiting one of the 65 other provinces. Dijon. There’s a large church there –.” “Ah, of course,” the Duke said. “Can’t expect him to remain satisfied with a tiny province like La Rue Sauvage forever. I wish him success.” Papa knit his brow. “He’s not seeking a better position. Just visiting.” “Oh, he has friends there?” “Yes. Well – friends he’s made there. On previous visits.” “Ah. I see,” the Duke said, smiling. I looked from one face to the other, trying to understand. “What are you saying, Monsieur Laurent?” “Nothing at all, Helena. For any man, even a priest, there comes a time to think about the future. I came here from Versailles myself and I’m quite proud of our accomplishments. But I wouldn’t blame anyone for seeking opportunity in a larger province. Somewhere more comfortable or safe. A man like Father Vestille could become very influential if he found the right church.” I felt as if he had ripped my heart out and left a gaping hole in my chest. “You think he wants to leave?” He shrugged. “I couldn’t tell you what he’s planning. But I find it hard to imagine him remaining content with a small church when he could do so much more, and be well-rewarded for his service. And there are certainly safer places to preach than La Rue Sauvage.” Mama bowed her head and spoke in the firm voice she usually reserved for scolding me. 66 “We’ve known Father Abier Vestille for years. We invited him here from Burgundy, after we settled. He’s not cowardly or opportunistic and never has been. He only wants to serve others.” “I certainly understand that,” the Duke said. “But – well, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure if you know him that well, you know the true purpose of his trip to Dijon.” Papa shifted his foot as Mama fell silent. “He didn’t say. Exactly.” The Duke looked from Papa to Mama and back again, still offering a friendly smile. He cleared his throat, sounding uncomfortable. “No matter, Henri. Whatever the reason, I’m certain his trips take precedence. Come. Enjoy the party. We have a wonderful feast.” He strode toward a table filled with rich food and we moved to follow him, though I began to drag my feet. Father Vestille had always been like part of our family. Before last year, he visited our house every Sunday after Mass. We ate lamb or stew and talked about the Scripture lessons and the events in the village and the new dress Mama was making. He sat me on his lap to tell him everything the sheep and Valiant were doing, everything I saw in the field that day, every cloud and flower and insect. Before last year, that is. Before the wolf. “Hey, Helennna,” Francois said, bending down to take my arm. “Hey, let me introduce you to a friennnd of mine.” He waved a heavy hand 67 toward the bar, as though he were trying to fish something out of the air. Mama started toward me, but Papa held her back with an arm around her shoulder. “She’ll be all right. It’s their party. We’re safe in here, at least.” Mama relented and they stepped away with the Duke. A man wearing an apron stepped out from behind the bar and marched toward us. He had strong arms and a broad, crooked smile beneath a mop of reddish-brown hair. Francois waved his arm toward the man and thumped him in the chest. “This’s my bessst friend in all of France. Gerard Touraine. He ownsss the place.” “He’s the one you told me about, right?” I asked. Monsieur Touraine put his hands on his knees and bent toward me. “So you’re the little girl my overbearing friend here rescued. May I say, Mademoiselle, how pleased I am that he did.” I felt myself blush. “Thank you, Monsieur.” “She’s not ssso little anymore,” Francois said with a silly smile. “She just turned eight.” Monsieur Touraine’s eyebrows rose. “Eight? I can tell.” “Thank you,” I beamed. “Like I said,” Francois continued. “If you ever need anything, if you ever need real help, Gerard’sss your man. He’ll take care of you, whateverrr you need. I promissse.” 68 Monsieur Touraine slid a sideways glance at Francois, then smiled back at me. “Well, for now, how about this?” He reached into the front pocket of his apron and pulled out a peppermint stick. “My favorite!” I gasped. “Is it?” Monsieur Touraine asked, grinning at Francois. “Isn’t that a coincidence? I had no idea.” “See what I mean? Anything you need, jussst come to Gerard. He’ll alwaysss take care of you.” Monsieur Touraine put a hand on Francois’s shoulder. “Such as taking care of seeing you home tonight, friend.” Francois sputtered and waved him off. “The Duke’sss servants’re seeing me home tonight. You hearrr that? The Duke’s!” “A hero’s wages,” Monsieur Touraine laughed. He bent to kiss my hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle.” He turned and moved back to the bar, where he poured a drink for one of the men sitting there. “He’s nice,” I said. “The nicccest.” “I’m glad everyone knows you’re a hero now.” “Awww.” Francois blinked, his face turning serious. “You know what a – You know what a hero is, Helena? A hero doesn’t have to be big or strong or sssmart. He just has to stand up to do what’sss got to be done. People might not underssstand what you’re doin’ or why you’re 69 doin’ it. But it’s still got to be done, whether they understand it or not. A hero’s just sssomebody who stands up to do it when nobody else will. That’sss all. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped. All I did was stand up.” I smiled. “Well, you’re my hero.” He grinned at me. “Yeah? Well, you’re mine!” He lifted his bottle toward me. “Cheersss, Mademoiselle.” I clinked my peppermint stick against it. “Cheers, Monsieur.” He took a deep swig from his ale while I sucked on my candy. 70 8. “That was the best party last night,” I beamed, no longer focusing on the needle and thread in my hands. Mama wanted me to practice sewing straight lines on an old patch, but I was too excited. She sat beside me at our dining table, creating a new dress. “It was interesting,” she said, her voice subdued as she stared at the linen and lace spread over her lap. I glanced at my needle to keep from pricking myself. “I met Monsieur Touraine. He 71 owns the tavern and he’s Francois’ best friend. He gave me three peppermints. And we ate peanuts and pretzels and drank ginger beer, and Francois showed me how to blow bubbles in it.” Mama gave a small smile. “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.” I fixed my attention on the needle and thread. “Once I learn how to sew this patch, I can start sewing dresses. And then you can teach me how to sew clothes for you and Papa.” “That’s right, dear. But keep working on that patch first. Careful you don’t get another snarl.” “I’m gonna be a great seamstress, just like you and Grand’Mere Marie.” Her gaze dropped into her lap. “… She made some beautiful things.” I squinted at the needle and thread, still struggling to make a good backstitch. I stopped again. “When I’m older, maybe I can serve at a fancy party. Like the one last night. Except with more ladies. I could make dresses for everyone.” “That would be nice,” Mama said. “Or someone might invite you.” I shook my head. “No. But no one needs to invite me. I just want to make something beautiful for someone to wear. Something bright red. If I can’t have a pretty face, I can still make pretty dresses like you.” Mama stared at the material in her lap, saying nothing. I frowned. “Too bad Father Vestille couldn’t come.” 72 “Yes. We missed seeing him.” I pretended to study my needle. “Mama? Do you think what Monsieur Laurent said is true? Do you think Father Vestille wants to leave?” Her face screwed up. “Not a word. With all respect, our Duke doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” “How do you know for sure? What if Father Vestille wants to move somewhere else, like back to Burgundy?” She put down her sewing. “Father Vestille came here when we learned there had been no priest in La Rue Sauvage for eight years. He’s been here ever since. He has no intention of leaving.” “But that was before.” Her eyebrows rose. “Before what?” I stiffened. “Before the wolf.” She leaned forward. “You imagine he’s running away?” I shrugged. “We never see him anymore. He’s always traveling, always visiting other people. Ever since last year.” She lowered her chin. “Listen to me, Helena. Your father and I trust Father Vestille with our lives. He would not leave without telling us first, if he ever actually considered leaving. And he won’t abandon us.” “But how can you know for certain? What if he’s changed? He’s not like Francois or Duke Laurent. He’s just an ordinary man. Maybe he’s worried there’s another wolf out there.” Mama sighed. “Helena. Father Vestille has always helped us whenever we needed it. He 73 always will. I don’t know what his trips involve. He never wants to discuss it. But I trust him. You don’t have to know all of a person’s activities to know you can depend on them. And you don’t have to be strong or influential to be brave.” I hoped she was right. That Father Vestille would never leave us. But I couldn’t stop wondering. “All right. If you’re certain.” She smiled into her lap, returning to her sewing. “There are many things I’m not certain about,” she said. “But I’m certain of Father Vestille.” I didn’t dare argue with her further. I heard Papa’s boots clomp onto the porch, then stop. We both turned. The front door creaked open, letting in the early morning chill. Papa entered as though he had seen a ghost. “Papa, what’s wrong?” I asked. We had left the banquet early last night and made it home well before nightfall, but Mama and Papa had let me sleep as late as I wanted. My head was still filled with memories of the roast duck and caviar and raspberry tarts, and meeting Monsieur Touraine and the Duke’s friends. What could possibly have spoiled Papa’s mood after such a thrilling party? “Celeste. I need – I need to speak with you.” “Papa?” His eyes warned me to keep still. “Stay inside.” Mama dropped her sewing and swept toward the front door. She hurried outside and Papa shut the door behind her. 74 I stayed inside as I was told and continued working on the practice patch, determined to sew a straight line. My thread snarled into another knot and I grumbled. How could I concentrate when Papa was on the front stoop sharing some dreadful secret? But I kept to my place. I tried to loosen the tiny knot and start over with my line. I didn’t even creep closer to listen. Until Mama wailed. I ran to the door and threw it open. Mama covered her face with both hands, sobbing. Papa held her by the shoulders. She looked as though she might crumple to the ground if he let go. “What happened? What is it?” “Back inside!” Papa barked. I stepped away from his glare of rage. I slammed the door and marched back to the table. I snatched up my patch, with its needle and tangled thread, and slapped it down on the tabletop. Stupid patch! Why couldn’t I at least make something that wasn’t ugly? They were keeping something from me. Something terrible. Like they kept everything else. I couldn’t venture outside. I couldn’t be left alone. I couldn’t go anywhere, even with them, if it got too late in the day. They meant to keep me cooped up in our cottage forever. I slumped back into my chair. I was still seething when the door opened, an inch at a time. Papa trudged in with a wary look, like he was afraid of me. Or of something else. “Helena …” 75 He moved like a sleepwalker to the chair beside me. Mama followed him like a dutiful soldier, head down. Her face red, her eyes squinting and sore. “Helena,” Papa started again. “Something happened to Francois.” “What?” I glanced from one solemn face to the other. “Is Crimson all right?” Papa seemed to stare through me at someone else or someplace else. “I believe so. But Lightning is gone.” “Gone where?” Mama turned aside. The sunlight from the windows glinted off the tears on her cheeks. “Henri, perhaps we should talk about this another time …” “No, Celeste. She’s going to hear it from someone over the next few days. It’s just as well that she hear it from us.” Mama fixed her gaze on me and stiffened. I felt as though they were waiting for something to happen to me. “What’s wrong? Tell me.” Papa swiped his large hands over his face. As if trying to wipe something away. “Helena. … Francois is dead. So is his mare.” I stared at Papa, trying to understand. Stared at his mouth that had just spoken those words. Saw him speak them again, in my mind. He said Francois was dead, just like Grand’Mere Marie was dead. Just like Pierre’s mother. Dead. “… How come?” My throat felt strangled. 76 Papa licked his lips. Glanced from side to side. Sat back a little in his chair. “Some wolves attacked him. In his house.” My mind saw the blue-gray eyes again, shining out of the black tunnel. Shining out of the dark forest. Watching me. Waiting. I breathed deeper. Felt my heart beat faster. “How did they get inside?” Papa scratched at his chin. “His door – somehow came off its hinges. And they all went in.” My temples throbbed, my lip quivering. “How many?” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Looked like four of them, at the least.” “How do you know?” “Henri,” Mama interrupted. “She’s going to hear it,” he repeated. Mama bit her lip. Papa swallowed. He stared straight into my eyes. “What happened to Francois – was very sad. When they found him, he was – he was not in one piece. They tore him asunder. Lieutenant-General Sharrad figures it took at least four of them to do it.” My insides felt hollow as a dead log. “And the mare?” “Henri …” Papa’s eyes continued to burrow into me. “She was the same. All over the stable. They found the foal tied up in its stall. Seemed to be struggling to get out.” “We’ve got to go get him!” I shrieked. 77 Papa paled. “We can’t care for an extra horse, Helena. He needs to go someplace where he can –.” “We’ve got to get him, Papa! We’ve got to bring him home before the wolves come back!” Mama took a step forward. “Francois may have relatives nearby, dear. They might want the foal for –.” “Crimson is mine! Francois promised him to me.” Papa’s eyebrows knit together. “He didn’t so much as promise to –.” “He promised I could ride him. How can I ride him if someone takes him away? How can I take care of him? The wolves came back for Francois. They’ll come for Crimson next.” They exchanged puzzled looks. Mama bent over me. “Darling, what do you mean, ‘the wolves came back’?” “Because Francois saved me. Because he killed one of them, and they wanted revenge.” Papa lowered his head and met my eyes. “Helena. Wolves don’t take revenge.” My eyes narrowed back at his. “They’re not wolves.” They gaped at me as I remembered the wolf looming over me on its hind legs, grinning with its sharp fangs. Those same eyes would always be there, shining in my memory and my nightmares. Mocking me. Threatening me. Terrifying me. “Where’s my cloak?” Their eyes bulged. 78 Mama wrung her hands. “Dear. Why do you ask?” “I want it. Where is it?” “It’s put away,” Papa said, straightening in his chair. “It’s mine. Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. Give it to me.” Mama lowered her chin. “Helena, that is no way to speak to your father.” “Where’s my cloak?” I demanded. I no longer cared what they would do to me for being so brash. Papa’s moustache formed a dark frown. “Helena. You’re never to wear that cloak again.” I turned from them and marched through the cottage. I knocked over books and cleared away half-sewn dresses from Mama’s table. Papa stood. “Calm yourself this instant, young lady.” I rummaged through baskets and pots and wooden boxes. “Where is it? I want to wear it. It’s mine! I want to wear it right now!” “Helena, stop,” Mama begged. I ran to their room at the rear of the cottage. I opened boxes of their personal items, boxes I was never allowed to touch. “It’s my cloak!” “Stop it, Helena,” Papa growled. “Stop now!” I kept digging, past Mama’s leather-bound journal and her flasks of perfume. Past Papa’s snuff pouches and spare cartridges and his old crossbow from the war. “Helena!” 79 Papa’s massive fist closed around my wrist and yanked me away. He held me against his chest as I thrashed about. I didn’t care if he dragged me outside and flogged me with a switch for acting like a spoiled brat. What did it matter if he beat me? What did anything matter anymore? He held me. Held me tight and refused to let me go. I wriggled against him, pounding my small fists on his chest. I shut my eyes, ground my teeth, beat my head against him. Then I collapsed and bawled into his tunic. “I want my cloak,” I cried, gushing tears. “I want to wear my red cloak.” Papa’s breath rustled in and out of his lungs like a bear, as Mama’s gentle hands stroked my hair. “I’ll ask about the horse,” Papa said at last. “We can build another stall for the stable.” 80 9. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over the body of Francois Revelier. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as if he could see the body beneath the heavy lid. “I did not know 81 Francois Revelier well,” he said. “I wish I did. What I do know is that he was a brave man. An honorable man. A man whom others could depend on. As a foreman in his woodcutting business. As a neighbor. And as a friend. Francois Revelier risked his life in an attempt to save his own neighbor, Marie Justine. He heard her cries too late to rescue her, but because of his bravery, his compassion, and his willingness to act, he rescued her granddaughter, Helena Basque, who sits here among us today.” He extended an open hand toward me. Several heads turned. Staring at me and my scars. “Because of his swift and courageous action, the Basque family – and all of us as well – were spared sorrow upon sorrow. They lost a beloved mother that day, a kind woman I knew back in Burgundy, who moved here to be with her daughter and their family.” Mama withdrew a lace handkerchief, one she had embroidered herself, and wiped at her eyes, sniffing. “Francois was a good neighbor to her, to the very end,” Father Vestille continued. “If he could have given his life for hers, I believe he would have. Because that is what he was willing to do for Helena.” Mama wrapped her arm around me and squeezed me closer. “It is ironic – and tragic – that he should suffer the same fate as Marie Justine, a year after destroying the wolf that claimed her life.” Father Vestille paused, as though thinking of something 82 else. Something important. Then he went on. “We can’t fully understand these events, any more than we can understand any such tragedy. But I hope we can all agree on one thing. Whether we knew Francois as a close friend or neighbor, or only heard of his actions in saving young Helena, Francois Revelier was a hero.” I felt as though my guts had been hollowed out. Father Vestille was right. Francois was a hero. But now he was gone. And the wolves were still out there. Who else would stand up to them? The Mass ended. Papa and Monsieur Leóne joined four other men to carry the casket outside. They secured thick ropes under it and lowered it down into a dark rectangular pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Francois there in the dirt forever. “I don’t understand,” Pierre said, suddenly beside me. “Don’t understand what,” I said. My throat felt like dry leaves. “Those wolves. Four of them, maybe more. Just breaking into Francois’ house and attacking him all at once. Like they meant to do it.” I said nothing. I just stared into the dark hole. “Red. That animal we saw, in the tunnel near the bridge. You think that might have been one of them?” “… yes.” “We should have said something. Somebody could’ve stopped it.” 83 I kept staring into the emptiness. Wondering if Pierre was right. But who could we have told? Who would have stopped that wolf, let alone the others? “We gotta be careful,” Pierre went on. “Things like that running around, attacking out of nowhere. I can understand why your parents don’t go out at night.” “Pierre!” I glanced to see Monsieur Leóne beckoning Pierre away. He was speaking to a couple of people I didn’t recognize. “I think Papa’s gathering some new clients. Probably wants me to talk to them, too, to discuss what we can make for them.” He touched my shoulder. “Red. You all right?” I stood stiff and unmoving. Then I nodded, for Pierre’s sake. “Just take care, all right? Those wolves make me nervous.” He hurried away to join his father. “They’re not wolves,” I muttered to no one. At the back of the crowd, I saw Francois’ friend, Monsieur Touraine. He stared sadly at the hole where Francois was laid, but his gaze soon turned blank. I wanted to speak to him, but he turned suddenly and disappeared. “I’ll write to the court again,” Duke Laurent was telling Papa, as he and Mama approached from behind me. “I’ll send Simonet there in person if I have to. Maybe the guards will let him through. Or at least recognize the urgency. They have to see we need soldiers and hunters here 84 to help Lieutenant-General Sharrad’s police kill these things.” “I would appreciate that, Monsieur,” Papa said, sounding numb. Almost as numb as I felt. “Helena. Are you ready to go? Did you get to speak to Father Vestille?” I turned, spotting Father Vestille shaking hands with a couple of guests across the graveyard. “No,” I said, my senses burning. “Not yet.” I strode straight past Papa and Mama and Duke Laurent toward Father Vestille, as he smiled and nodded and showed his concern for the couple talking to him. A couple of people I had never seen before. People he must have visited all of last week, when he disappeared on another of his frequent journeys. Father Vestille lowered his head and spoke quietly with them, a man and a woman in a plain cloak and shawl, which the woman curled about her shoulders as she listened. Seeing me, Father Vestille stopped speaking abruptly. He managed a small smile. “Helena. I want you to meet some friends of mine. This is Monsieur and Madame Serrone, from DeSarte. They came to –.” “Where were you? Where did you go?” I glared up at him, fists clenched. I knew his friends were gaping at me in shock but I didn’t bother looking. I couldn’t care less about them. “I was – visiting some friends.” Father Vestille tugged at his collar with two fingers. “I went to DeSarte, to visit the Serrones here, and some others at their parish.” 85 “That’s why you couldn’t come to Francois’ party?” His Adam’s apple shifted as he swallowed, like a minstrel performer who had forgotten his next line. Did he assume no one would question him? Where he went, what he did? And why? “I wanted to come. I simply – There were other matters I had to attend to, Helena. I’m sorry I couldn’t be with you.” “That doesn’t help anyone now. Does it?” “Helena!” Papa barked. “Mind how you speak to Father Vestille.” He bent down behind me, his harsh breath on my neck, but I didn’t turn. I kept staring into Father Vestille’s pleading eyes. “I’m – sorry, Helena,” Father Vestille said. “I would have come if I could.” “But you couldn’t,” I finished. “Because you had to visit your other friends.” “Helena, that is enough,” Papa growled. As I held Father Vestille’s gaze, his lip quivered. I didn’t care. He should have been sorry. So should Duke Laurent, for not making the King listen and send soldiers. So should Papa and Monsieur Leóne, for doing so little to stop the wolves themselves, and Mama for pretending everything would be all right. Why wouldn’t anyone do something? Francois was the only one willing to act, and now he was gone. “Helena, we’re going home,” Papa said. I didn’t turn to him. I just kept staring into Father Vestille’s sunken eyes. Then I whirled and 86 marched straight toward our wagon. “We don’t have a home.” “Helena!” Papa shouted. His voice broke off as he started to call me again, and I knew Mama’s calming hand was on his arm. I heard her speak gently to Father Vestille. “Please forgive her, Father. She’s angry.” I marched to the wagon, ready to knock aside anyone who stood in my way. Yes, I thought. I’m angry. 87 10. Crimson thundered across the grass, kicking up dirt and fallen leaves as I pulled back on his reins for an abrupt halt. I had grown taller in the last eighteen months, to sit high in the saddle. And I had ridden Crimson so much over the summer that I felt we could read each other’s minds. I barely needed to pull the reins anymore, in any direction, to tell him what I wanted him to do. “Watch this, Mama!” From the front stoop, Mama looked up from her sewing. She cast another glance toward 88 the darkening forest, before returning her attention to me. Papa had been gone all day on his hunt. “Turn!” I called, nudging Crimson’s flanks and tugging the reins to the left. Crimson spun in a dizzying circle. Once, twice, a third time. Then he stomped his front hooves to stop as I pulled back on the reins. “Be careful, dear,” Mama said. “I’m always careful. Watch this!” I nudged Crimson again and we charged at the sheep pen, kicking up dirt as we stopped abruptly at the edge of the gate. The sheep bleated in terror and nearly fell all over themselves. “Did you see that, Mama? They’re hilarious!” “Helena. Don’t scare the sheep.” I frowned. What else was there for me to do? The horses and sheep were all fed and watered. And I had long since given up on learning how to sew. I would never have Mama’s patience. But I had finally discovered something I could master. I could ride. For the first year since Francois was killed, Crimson and I had simply played, running back and forth in the yard. At times, he needed me to calm him, at the sound of a wolf’s howl. Not to calm his fears, but his rage, as he searched about the yard for the source of the sound, ready to charge after it. I coaxed him with pieces of apple or sugar at first, and he soon learned to calm at the sound of my voice. Papa worried that it was too soon to saddle Crimson at the start of the summer, soon after my 89 ninth birthday. But Crimson was strong and seemed eager for it. When he saw the saddle in Papa’s hands, he stomped at the ground, then stayed steady and quiet as Papa fit him with it. As if he wanted me to ride him the way he had seen other visitors ride their horses. We started slowly at first, as Papa led me in a circle around the meadow. Within two weeks, Crimson and I could ride on our own. Which we did every day, for the rest of the summer. “Mama!” I called again as I climbed off the saddle. She looked up. I moved to Crimson’s right side and stuck my left foot in the stirrup. Then I grabbed the saddle’s horn and shouted, “Hah!” Crimson trotted toward the stoop as I hung alongside him, one foot in the stirrup, the other dangling in the air. Mama dropped her sewing. “Helena!” “It’s all right, Mama. I’ve been practicing.” She was still standing with her delicate fists clenched as we trotted up to her, her eyes bulging as I jumped down. “See, Mama? I’m fine.” She said nothing. Just stared at me, her breathing shallow and rapid against the lace bodice of her dress. Crimson snorted and turned toward the forest. I glanced back to see Papa approaching on Royale. A thin animal carcass, tied to the rear of his saddle, scraped a trail through the piles of dead leaves behind him. “Papa!” I called. 90 He waved toward us and continued plodding closer. He always seemed to ride home slowly after a hunt, and this one had obviously been difficult. I turned to Mama. “Can I ride over the hill? Just to the other end of the meadow?” “You know you can’t. Especially near dark.” “Papa goes out.” “Papa hunts.” Royale trudged closer through the scraping leaves. I climbed back onto the saddle and urged Crimson to race toward him. “Papa! I learned a new trick!” “Helena, wait!” He held up a hand, looking alarmed. “It’s all right, I can do it!” I called as we drew near them. “What did you –?” The carcass behind them was a black wolf. Crimson whinnied. I tugged back on his reins and gasped, as his hooves kicked up dirt and leaves. Crimson snorted and stomped again. I patted his head to calm him. “Papa! What –? Why did you –?” “I was chasing a rabbit. So was this thing. I missed the rabbit but shot him.” His face turned to stone. “It’s meat.” I settled Crimson down with some effort. Then I made him canter forward at an easy pace. We paused behind Royale and I stared at the silent animal while Crimson quivered and snorted beneath me. 91 The wolf’s claws were open, as if they could still strike. The twisted jaws and fangs looked ready to devour. The open, unseeing eyes stared mindlessly at the sky. They were not blue-gray. I steadied my breathing as I studied the wolf. The wolf Papa had brought to our home. “It was all I could find,” he said in a softer tone. I focused on breathing in and out. In and out. “I understand,” I said. I turned Crimson away and urged him back to the cottage. Crimson tossed his head and gave another snort of agitation. He surely felt the same rage, seeing the creature that took his own mother from him last year. Though this animal was different from that monster. This was just an ordinary wolf. Mama gasped as Papa arrived at the front stoop. “Henri! What on earth –?” “All I could find,” he repeated. “Couldn’t let good meat go to waste. It’s dinner.” The sun continued to sink toward the horizon. The sky would grow black in another few hours and we would shut ourselves inside. I half-turned. “It’s dead?” “Of course,” Papa said. “I shot it.” I looked back at the horizon, shivering, though not because of the evening chill. “It’s all right,” I said. I heard Papa climb down from the saddle. Heard him untie the animal. The animal I didn’t want to see, though I already saw it in my every nightmare. 92 I set my jaw. “Turn,” I ordered Crimson, tugging his reins. We turned about to face it. The long black animal that could no longer harm anyone or anything, because Papa had shot it. It could no longer attack me, except in my dreams. It was dead. Crimson bristled beneath me, but he settled as I stroked his flank. As we faced the wolf together. Papa carried it to the carving table next to the sheep pen, as Crimson and I watched. Mama wrung her hands and followed him. I climbed down from Crimson’s back and led him toward them. Mama stared at the furry beast stretched across the flat surface. I heard Papa mutter, “It was the best I could do, my dear.” “I know,” she murmured back. She heaved a slow sigh, then held out her hand. Papa tugged the cleaver up from the wooden tabletop where he had buried it that morning. He handed it to Mama, then walked back toward the house. Mama stared at the dead beast another moment before she swung the cleaver down to hack off its head. Blood spurted up and dirtied her lace dress. She didn’t bother trying to clean it off. I hitched Crimson to the porch and followed Papa into the house. He grabbed his pipe from the mantle and lit it, then sat in his rocking chair, puffing away. I stood nearby but he would 93 not look at me, as he kept puffing and rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. “Papa, teach me to hunt.” He gagged and coughed a couple of times, his muddy boots stamping the floor as he bent forward. I feared he might choke on his tobacco. “… What did you say?” “Teach me to hunt,” I repeated. He continued to stare at me. Then he looked away, returning to his rocking and smoking. “You don’t need to hunt anything,” he said with a dismissive air. I relaxed my shoulders and stood taller. “You won’t always be around. I can’t stay indoors forever. Someday I’ll have to go out. And I’ll have to be prepared, if I ever meet one of them.” He waved me off. “No,” he said in a harsher tone, his smoke permeating the room. “You don’t need to worry about those wolves. They’re not your concern. Duke Laurent will have the King send soldiers to handle them.” I took a step forward. “Papa. No soldiers are coming. We’re the only soldiers we have.” He puffed in silence, staring at nothing. He leaned forward and swiped his hand over his forehead. As if he wanted to wipe away everything that had happened. Grand’Mere’s death. My scars. Francois’ death. All the terror we lived with for the last two years. But nothing could wipe it away and he knew it. I could tell, as he hung his head and shut his eyes. 94 “I know you want to protect me, Papa. But even if I stayed here forever, what’s to stop the wolves from breaking in the windows, like they did at Francois’ house?” His eyes flashed at me in a sudden rage. As if he had never considered that possibility. Or as if he had considered it for many nights since Francois’ death, but knew he could do nothing about it. “Papa, I need you to really protect me. Protect me by showing me how to protect myself.” He stared at the far wall, as if I no longer stood in the room. He puffed at his pipe, the smoke rising in gray wisps. “I’ll think on it,” he said. “Go settle the horses.” I walked out front, leaving him to smoke, his head in his hand. I stepped outside and unhitched Crimson. Then I gathered Royale by the reins and led him past Mama to the stable, settling him in his stall and giving him some water. I stepped outside the stable to catch Crimson’s eye and whistled for him. He sprang from his place and charged at me in a gallop. He knew how fast to come by how shrill and sharp I whistled. He snorted once at the wolf carcass as he passed, then thundered to a stop beside me. I patted his head and hugged his neck. “Good boy, Crimson. That was fast. Someday you might even beat Diamond.” Crimson tossed his head and snorted again, as if he knew I was daring to compare him with Pierre’s horse. I led him back to his stall with my hand on his back, as he shook twice. 95 “I know,” I said, petting him. “I know you’re angry about the wolf. But it’s not the thing that killed your mother. It’s just a wolf, and it’s dead. And someday we’ll figure out how to get rid of those things, whatever they are. All right? We’ll make sure they never hurt anyone again.” After removing both of their saddles, I drew Crimson’s water and petted him some more, wishing I could ease his mind. He continued to stamp and fidget, glancing back at the stable entrance twice. As if the wolf could rise from Mama’s work table and attack us. I kept petting him. “It’s all right. You’re safe with me now. And I won’t let anything hurt you, ever again.” I continued to smooth his mane and his neck, and he breathed easier. Then he perked up and glanced at the entrance. Papa stood there within the stable, his hands at his sides. The pipe smoldered silently from his hip. His mustached face was in shadow within the waning light and I couldn’t see his features. “If you wish to hunt, you must do exactly as I say, without question. You will step where I tell you to step. You will keep silent when I tell you to keep silent. You will shoot when I tell you to shoot. Whatever I tell you to do, you cannot hesitate. Understood?” I shuddered. “Yes, Papa.” He stood there, a husky shadow, as if we stood in someone’s tomb. “You’ll rise early tomorrow. As soon as you finish your chores, we’ll head into the woods.” 96 The woods. Where the black wolf spoke to me. Where it watched and waited for me as I hurried to Grand’Mere’s house. “… yes, Papa.” His shadow nodded, then brought the smoldering pipe to his lips and strode back to the house. I stood there, frozen. I petted Crimson again, my fingers trembling against him. “You see? I told you. There’s nothing to worry about. We’re going to learn how to hunt, and then we won’t have to be afraid of anything anymore.” I laid my head against his, wondering how I would make myself sleep tonight. “Everything’s going to be all right, Crimson, I promise,” I said. “Tomorrow morning, we’re going back into the woods.” 97 98 99 MY RISE 100 101 11. I smiled and patted Crimson’s neck as Papa and Royale led us out of the dark forest. The large buck I had shot scraped through pine needles on the ground behind Royale, tied to his saddle. It was my twelfth deer since we had started hunting over a year ago. Papa kept glancing back at it, beaming. He said this one was bigger than any animal he had ever killed. Before we mounted the horses to head home, he actually chuckled and clapped me on the back. 102 Sunlight glinted through the trees, now in full bloom, their leaves still wet with mist and mountain fog. I closed my eyes a moment. I no longer minded feeling the sun on my triple-scarred face. The long days of summer were just a month away, when we could stay outside longer, riding and hunting. I unfastened the side holster of Crimson’s saddle, which held Papa’s crossbow. He had given me his old weapon from the war to use for hunting, until I was ready to borrow his musket. But I never felt the need to switch. I loaded a bolt and hung the crossbow’s front end down over my right shoe as we rode. I looped its front strap over my toe and yanked up tight, feeling my firm bicep muscle twitch as I locked the bolt into place. “What are you doing back there, Helena?” Papa asked, not bothering to look. “Keeping myself ready.” I could hear the smile in his voice, as he relaxed in the saddle and took in the view of the fir and pine trees. He had trained me to stay prepared, to watch for signs of danger, to survive against predators in the forest. He hardly asked me questions anymore while we hunted, but whenever he did, I answered correctly. “Ready for what?” he asked. “Anything.” He chuckled again. “Exactly, sweetheart. Exactly.” I sat taller in the saddle, enjoying the easy ride home, the gentle breeze on my face, and the sounds of the waking forest. When we had started 103 hunting, every rustling leaf or calling bird made me flinch. I had tripped over my dress several times trying to cross a stream or climb over large rocks. I lost three slippers in the mud before Papa built me a pair of wooden shoes. I wanted boots like his, but we could hardly afford a second pair, just to train a girl how to hunt. The first few months, I didn’t have the strength to even arm the crossbow, let alone shoot straight. When I did shoot, I was terrified. Afraid of missing and afraid of killing. “Shove your fear aside,” Papa had told me. “Shove it aside and shoot.” I followed all of his instructions, as I had promised. No matter how pointless or exhausting it seemed. No matter how many bruises and cuts and open blistering sores my mother had to clean off of me later. Until I learned to clean them myself. Over the last eighteen months, I had grown stronger, faster and stealthier. I learned to measure the landscape before entering it, to avoid snapping twigs or slipping on a muddy patch of ground. A few months ago, I finally developed the strength to arm my crossbow from the saddle, something even a boy my age would struggle to do. I enjoyed my new strength, to help Papa lift a deer carcass from the ground. To chase Valiant through the meadow for several minutes before I started breathing heavily. And to carry two large buckets of water from the nearby well, though Papa still watched me travel the whole distance, resting on the porch with his musket ready. 104 But he allowed me more and more freedom and asked me to help with more chores. I turned eleven last month, and I had developed strength and skills to rival that of most boys. Strength to survive. As we broke through the trees to enter our meadow, Valiant barked from his place beside the sheep pen and ran to meet us. Mama watched from the stoop as we approached. She didn’t stand like she usually did, but kept sewing. My kill today would catch her attention. I led Crimson to trot over to her, beaming as Papa and I dismounted to untie the deer. Together, we dragged it to the carving table and hoisted it up. The heavy buck’s antlers cracked as it struck the oak surface in a heap. Mama’s nose wrinkled as if a skunk had sprayed us. “A good hunt?” she asked. I spread my hands toward the enormous deer and smiled, saying nothing more. Valiant barked, as if voicing his agreement. “Come inside and wash up,” Mama said. “Your father can clean the deer.” “It’s a large one,” he said. “I would like some help to –.” “I want a few moments to speak with Helena.” Papa gaped. Mama rarely dared to interrupt him. He bent to retrieve the cleaver that the deer’s carcass had knocked to the ground, wiped it on his tunic, and set to work. They must have agreed beforehand on whatever Mama wished to discuss. I couldn’t tell if it might be good or bad news, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t afraid anymore. 105 Of anything. Then she led me inside and told me she was going to have a baby. 106 12. “Can’t catch me!” Suzette giggled, dodging this way and that through our meadow. Her wooly blanket trailed behind, clutched in her tiny fist as she ran her hardest in the waning sunlight. “Oh, I’ll catch you!” I laughed back, stepping sideways to block her escape. “Or I will!” Pierre said, rushing to her other side. Suzette squealed as Valiant ran around us all, barking. We pretended my four-year old sister was too fast and agile for two fifteen-year olds to grab. We reached for her, missing each time, 107 which made her laugh harder. “Come here, you!” I demanded in a playful tone. “No!” she called, her short legs turning awkwardly to hurry away. Pierre was better at pretending. He kept jumping right next to Suzette, while Valiant barked around his ankles to make sure he wasn’t harming her. Then he would nearly snatch the back of her cotton dress before his fingers closed on empty air. “Missed again! I can’t believe it!” “Too bad for you!” Suzette called. I leaped in front of her as she turned away from the bare trees of the forest. She shrieked and retreated as Pierre barred her escape in the other direction. Then I landed behind her and seized the trailing end of her blanket. “My woolie!” She grinned and grunted as she tugged at her blanket, refusing to let go. I dragged her closer and scooped her into the air. “We got her!” Pierre called. He knelt down to pet Valiant, who had started to growl. “Got you by your fuzzy woolie!” I said. I knew she wouldn’t release it. Mama made it for her two years ago and Suzette had held tight to it ever since, the way I used to guard my red cloak. She struggled to pull free. “Lemme go! And gimme my fuzzy woolie or I’ll beat your head! Nngh!” Her tiny fingers tried to pry my arm loose. Until I turned her around and held her against my chest. Then she threw her blanket over my shoulder, flung her arms around my neck and held on tight. “Take me for a big ride.” 108 “All right, hang on!” I trotted like a horse, running in small circles around the chilly meadow, while Pierre ruffled Valiant’s fur. Suzette giggled as I bounced her up and down. Crimson snorted at us from the sheep pen, where he had been trotting. I had trained him to stay close by, even when he wasn’t hitched up, to show Papa how well we could take care of ourselves. Crimson appreciated the freedom, but now he seemed eager to join us. Winter was coming, and he wouldn’t have many days left to gallop before being cooped up in the barn until springtime. “No, no!” Suzette said, laughing. “Take me for a big ride on Crimson!” I whirled her around in the air and plopped her down on her feet. Crimson paced before the sheep pen like a guard dog, stealing glances at us. I bent toward Suzette and lowered my voice. “You know we can’t ride very long.” “I know, I know,” she said with a frown. She rolled her eyes and made a stern face like Papa’s. “‘It’s almost dark, girls. We don’t wanna be caught out after dark.’” “That’s right,” I said, stifling a smile. “But we can gallop twice around the meadow if you want.” She shook her head and leaned toward me with a wicked grin. “Let’s go scare all the sheeps,” she said. I glanced sideways at our empty front porch. “… I don’t know.” 109 “Aw, come on! Papa won’t hear us. They’ve been talking in there for days!” “More like an hour.” “Don’t know about what?” Pierre asked. I curled my lip. “Suzette wants to scare the sheep.” Pierre raised an eyebrow. “You told me what he said last time you did that.” “They probably won’t even hear us from the house,” I suggested. “Probably not,” he agreed. “Mama could probably keep your mother talking all night, if she wanted.” “I like Madame Lisette,” Suzette said, curling her arms around her blanket. “She plays with me.” “I like her, too,” I said. I cocked my head at Pierre. “You call her ‘Mama’?” He shrugged. “Sure. She’s been my stepmother over a year now.” “But you still miss your mother?” “Yeah,” he said, nodding sideways at the house. “But she’s my mother now.” “I suppose.” “Will you guys stop talking about mothers and start scaring the sheeps?” Suzette demanded, jamming her fists on her hips. We laughed. “Sorry, Suzette.” “What were we thinking?” Pierre said. He glanced at the porch for any sign of movement. “Just be careful, Red.” 110 “How come you always call Helena ‘Red’?” Suzette asked. “Is it ‘cause of her scratches on her face? ‘Cause that’s not nice.” Pierre shuddered. “Uh, no. Of course not. It’s because, uh …” I put up a hand. “She’s just curious.” I bent toward Suzette. “It’s because I used to wear a red cloak all the time, Suzette. When I was around your age.” “But you don’t anymore. So how come he calls you that still?” I smiled. “Some things just stick with you.” Suzette waved me off. “All right, fine. You can be ‘Red’. Let’s just scare the sheeps.” “All right, Silly.” I whistled for Crimson. He galloped straight at us. I peered around his flank to eye the porch once more. Pierre looked over his shoulder from the grass as he kept Valiant still. It always felt so peaceful when the Leónes came to visit. Monsieur Leóne seemed content with Madame Leóne, who was as good a seamstress as Mama. Their wedding two summers ago brought us a breath of fresh air, after years of gloom. Nearly as refreshing as the day Suzette was born. Signs of new life, that people could start over. And Pierre seemed even happier than usual since the wedding. Over the last few years he had grown stronger, a few inches taller, and far more confident. He had become highly skilled as a blacksmith’s apprentice, but he never even talked about it unless someone needed his assistance. He 111 treated all of our animals well, and he was wonderful for Suzette. I couldn’t think of a single day when he had failed to make her smile. I lifted Suzette onto Crimson’s back and placed her in front of the saddle. She sucked on her blanket as I hoisted myself up behind her. “Hold on tight,” I said. I wrapped my arm around her and she coiled her tiny arms around mine. Then she squealed as I urged Crimson forward and we charged at the sheep pen. The sheep heard us thundering at them and paused, searching all around for the source of the tremors. Spotting us, a few of them panicked and nearly stumbled sideways over one another, while the others kept chewing on their straw. “Run! Run, sheeps!” Suzette cried. “We’re gonna get you, sheeps!” “HELENA!” I yanked on the reins. Crimson skidded to a halt. I clutched Suzette so tight I feared I might cut off her air. Instead of wheezing, she laughed. I sat up and turned toward Papa’s booming voice. Pierre clenched his teeth, wincing at me. “Yes, Papa?” I asked in a quiet voice. Papa stood on the porch, his face flushed around his black frown of a moustache. “What on earth are you doing? You trying to give them a heart attack?” “Papa, the sheeps are so really funny!” Suzette giggled. 112 His face darkened. “They won’t be so really funny if they’re dead.” “But, Papa! You should’ve seen how the sheeps –!” I nudged her. “Hush, Suzette. Trust me, he knows.” Papa continued to glower at us, until even Crimson looked away. “Helena, I suggest you show more care around our flock, if you plan to join me on the hunt tomorrow.” “When can I go on a hunt?” Suzette asked. “I wanna go on a hunt tomorrow, too.” Papa blinked. “When you’re much older.” “I’m much older now. I just turned four. That’s as old as Helena was when it was the first time she hunted.” “I was nine,” I told her. “So? I’m almost nine, too.” I smiled. “Four is not almost nine. Or even close.” She soured and looked away. “Well, it is to me.” “All right, girls, get inside,” Papa said, waving us into the house. “It’s almost dark. We don’t want to be caught out after dark.” I tightened my lips to hold in a laugh. “Papa!” Suzette called, laughing out loud. “We were just saying –!” “Hush, Suzette!” I told her. “Let’s get Crimson bedded and go inside.” I dismounted and lifted Suzette down, then led Crimson to the stable. It was one of the few times I had to take his reins. He didn’t like being 113 cooped up in the stable, and I hated leaving him there, out in the open air. At least we had a lock on the door. Pierre joined us with a guilty smile. “Sorry, Red. I was watching you and Suzette ride and suddenly he was right there.” Valiant barked at Pierre’s heels, as if supporting his claim. “He has a way of doing that. It’s all right. Papa will forget about it eventually.” He entered the dusty stable with us. I unsaddled Crimson and stroked his neck to calm him, like always. Crimson fidgeted and kept checking Royale’s stall, as if making certain the horse was still there. “Is he always this agitated at night?” Pierre asked. I kept stroking Crimson, speaking in soft tones. “I don’t think he ever got over being trapped in Francois’ stall when the wolves came. He couldn’t do anything to stop it. Just had to stay there and watch, while they –.” I glanced down at Suzette. “Well, Francois’ mare, Lightning, was his mother.” “Helena, how come I can’t hunt? I’ll be good. I wanna be like you.” “Oh, you do?” Pierre bent down beside her. “You wanna shoot rabbits from fifty feet away like Red?” I blushed. “Pierre. That was only one time.” He ignored me and dropped to one knee, spreading his hands to make it more dramatic. “Your papa told me about it,” he said as Suzette 114 sucked on her blanket. “He and Red were out early one morning and they spied this rabbit way up ahead, moving behind an oak tree. They didn’t want to move any further or the horses would’ve scared it off. So they stood there, drawing their weapons. Your papa’s musket and Red’s crossbow.” “It’s actually Papa’s crossbow, from the war, actually,” Suzette told him. She learned the word “actually” last month and now used it whenever she could. “Sure, I know. Anyway, they were about fifty feet away, too far to get a good shot, so they were gonna creep up closer. Your papa took one step forward, real quiet. Then something spooked the rabbit. Maybe he sensed they were there, I don’t know. But he took off running and your papa figured they had lost it. But while he was thinking that, Red drew her crossbow in a flash. She fired one shot, straight at the rabbit, and sent it flying into a tree behind it. One shot. Fifty feet away. It was amazing. Your papa came bragging about it the same day at my papa’s shop, kept telling it to everybody who would listen. Some folks didn’t believe him, but I’ve heard plenty of other stories about Red’s hunting, so I know it’s true. She’s a better hunter than any of the men in town, but nobody wants to admit it.” “All right, Pierre, that’s enough,” I said, my cheeks burning. “Don’t fill her head with stories.” “Well, it’s true.” 115 I sighed, not wanting to discuss the details with both of them together. “It wasn’t exactly fifty feet.” “No?” “No,” I said firmly. I turned away, keeping my smile to myself. By Papa’s measure from the trees where we stood, it was fifty-eight. Actually. “Well, it’s still an impressive shot, Red. One of many.” His eyes lit up and he turned back to Suzette. “Your papa told me about another time when they –!” “Pierre, no more hunting stories. It’s time to settle down for the night.” “I like Pierre’s hunting stories!” Suzette complained. “How come I can’t go hunt with you and Papa, just for one time?” I stroked Crimson’s neck, as his eyes darted back and forth at the stable’s confining walls. Yes, how come? I wondered. Like Papa always said, we needed to be ready. Ready for anything. Pierre felt I could handle myself well enough. But what about Suzette? Who would protect her when the wolves came? I hugged Crimson’s neck, my fingers brushing back his mane as he gradually relaxed. “I’ll talk to Papa,” I said. “No promises.” Suzette’s whole face brightened. “Yay! I’m gonna be like you!” Pierre stood, looking pleased with himself. I hoisted Suzette into my arms. “Well, I want to be like you,” I said, stepping outside. She started one of her silly songs. “I wanna be like you, and you wanna be like me. And we 116 wanna be like Crimson. And Crimson wants to be a tree.” I set her down to close the stall door and lock it. “I doubt Crimson wants to be a tree.” “He has to. ‘Cuz that’s what rhymes.” “Why don’t we let Crimson be whatever he wants.” She ignored me and started up again, dancing in a circle. “And Crimson wants to be a tree. Or a butterfly. Or a frog. And Pierre likes to call you ‘Red’. ‘Cuz you blush when he’s around – !” “Shush!” I scolded her in a sharp voice. “Well, you do. Go see your face. It’s all –.” “‘Quiet’, I said. It’s almost time for bed.” “No, it’s not, either. I can –!” “Shush,” I told her, picking her up again to settle her. Suzette grumbled and sucked on her blanket, while Pierre tightened his lips, looking amused. I forced an awkward smile. “… She’s four.” He nodded with a grin. We heard a horse approaching. Shadowed against the setting sun, Father Vestille trotted toward our stoop on his gray Palomino. My gut went hollow. “Hello, Helena! Pierre! Suzette!” “Father Vestille!” Suzette squirmed like a fish until I set her down. She ran at Father Vestille, waving her blanket. He climbed down from his saddle and scooped her up. “Oh, you’re so heavy!” he joked. “How much candy have you eaten today?” 117 She giggled. “I’m not heavy, neither, Father Vestille.” He held her over his head and twirled her about. The same way he did with me, when I was only a child. “I can barely lift you!” he said. Suzette squealed, Pierre laughed, and Valiant barked. As I stood rigid, watching them. “Time to get inside, Suzette,” I said at last. “Awww.” Father Vestille stopped, surprised. He managed a smile and set her down. “Your sister’s right. Sorry I’m visiting so late in the day.” “Abier! How are you?” Papa appeared on the porch, with Mama and the Leónes behind him. He marched at Father Vestille and gave him a strong embrace. “How have you been, Henri?” They broke apart, looking a bit awkward. “We didn’t know when you’d be back,” Papa said. “Neither did I. I wanted to let you know I’ll be here this Sunday.” “We still gather.” Papa nodded toward the smiling group on the porch. “I’ve been leading prayers. Last weekend we discussed showing honor to the King, in spite of any rumors and misgivings.” He smiled sheepishly. “It was a humbling experience.” Father Vestille laughed and clapped him on the back. “You’re a good man, Henri. There’s no one I would rather have leading prayers when I’m away.” “Come inside. Have some wine.” They started toward the house. 118 “Only a little. I want to be up early tomorrow, visit some people in the village. I just got back and came here first.” “Why are we so special?” I asked. Papa and Father Vestille stopped where they stood. Everyone gaped at me. Father Vestille gave me his kindest eyes, the ones I remembered from years ago. “Because there’s no one I care more about than you and your family, Helena.” I said nothing. Just stared back at him. Mama stepped down from the porch and extended a hand toward him. “Come on in. Lisette brought over some fresh bread. She’s trying to convince me to start a clothing business together.” Father Vestille smiled. “You should. Between the two of you, you could already supply nearly half the dresses of the village.” Mama laughed. Madame Leóne stuck her hands on her hips with a clever grin. “Well, Father Vestille, most women won’t buy half a dress.” Everyone laughed, including Pierre, making Valiant bark again. I stiffened and waited for everyone to go inside. “Madame Lisette!” Suzette called, running to her. “Madame Suzette!” Madame Leóne smiled and squatted down. “How may I be of service?” Madame Leóne was beautiful like Mama, but in a different way. Although a few years older, she always looked radiant, her eyes crinkling at the corners with constant humor. 119 “I want you and Mama to make a special hunting dress ‘cuz I’m gonna go hunting with Helena!” Papa glared at me. So much for easing into the conversation. But he didn’t scold me. He only wrinkled his brow as he continued past Mama, who gaped at me from the porch. “Oh, a special hunting dress,” Madame Leóne said, playing along. “How about a little more blueberry pie instead?” “No! I wanna have my special hunting dress!” “Well, we’ll have to see about that with your Mama and Papa, I think. Come on inside.” Yes, we will, I thought as the adults meandered into the house. Pierre lingered outside a moment with me. Madame Leóne regarded him, then gave me a sly wink before ushering Suzette inside with a hand at her back. Mama threw a smiling glance at me before following them inside. I shook my head at their overactive imaginations. Pierre shoved his hands in his trouser pockets. “How come you’re mad at Father Vestille?” I turned and started walking away, past the bleating sheep. “Who said I’m mad?” “You did, with everything you’re doing. Figured you’d start throwing rocks at him next.” I didn’t want to talk about it. “We used to be close, when I was little,” I said. “Then I grew up. That’s it.” 120 “Red.” He stopped walking and faced me. “You act like he stole your horse. What did he do that’s so horrible?” I stiffened, wanting to turn away yet wanting to answer him. I knew I could still talk to Pierre about anything. Even this. “Nothing,” I said in a feeble voice, feeling myself tremble. “He didn’t do anything. When the wolf attacked, Francois came and killed it. Father Vestille came and helped get me to Doctor Renoire. After that – he stopped coming around.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “He’s at your house all the time.” I shook my head. “He used to visit us every Sunday for lunch and stay until dark. Some weeks he visited us a couple more times. Then the wolf killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me like this, and he started to disappear, making long trips to other provinces. Refusing to tell us where he was or what he was doing or why he had to go. He won’t admit that he’s looking for a better church to lead, in some province that’s not plagued by wolves.” Pierre dug his hands in his pockets and resumed our aimless stroll through the meadow. The sun dipped low, and I expected Papa’s voice to thunder from the front stoop at any moment. Don’t be caught out after dark, Helena. “Doesn’t fit,” Pierre said. “The way he preaches, the way he helps people. He’s been close to your parents since he moved here. Can’t see him moving on to another group of people.” I bit my lip. “Shows how wrong you can be about someone. You think he’ll be there when you 121 really need him. Then when there’s trouble, he’s nowhere around.” “Hmm,” Pierre said. “Well. Glad you’re not mad.” “Look, I just don’t –.” “Easy, Red. I’m teasing you. Will I still see you at Mass Sunday? I can find you a good spot at the back to throw rocks.” “I’ll be there. I can’t tell Mama and Papa I refuse to go. But don’t expect me to listen to anything he says.” Pierre fell silent. “You still pray?” “Of course,” I said. “Every morning and every night. But I haven’t gotten any answers yet.” “You’ve got Suzette, right? I never thought you’d love anything more than that crazy horse of yours. That’s an answer to prayer, isn’t it, having a sister?” I smiled. “Yes. It is.” My heart sank again as I turned toward the dismal forest. “But those things are still out there.” “You mean the wolves?” “They’re not wolves. I heard another lady was attacked a few months ago.” “Yeah, Madame Benoit, the miller’s wife. We went to the funeral.” “Was Father Vestille there?” “Uh, no. He was away. Another priest, Monsieur Benoit’s cousin, came from Dijon to lead the service.” “Hm. Surprising. The one thing Father Vestille rarely misses is a funeral.” 122 “You are really angry at him. Don’t you think you should give him another chance?” I considered that for all of two seconds. “He used to be there for our family. Now he’s not. And I’ve moved on. I needed him back then. I don’t need him now.” Pierre sighed deeply, dropping the subject. “All right. What’re you doing tomorrow?” “Helena!” We turned toward the sound of Papa’s voice, about fifty yards away. I barely noticed how far we had strayed. “Come on back. Pierre’s parents are about to head home and you don’t want to be caught out after dark. And you and I need to talk to your mother about Suzette joining us early tomorrow.” My pulse raced. “Yes, Papa!” I called back. So. He didn’t say that they needed to talk to Suzette, but that the two of us to talk to Mama. “Sounds like I’m going hunting,” I told Pierre. 123 13. The forest was cold and quiet the next morning, hardly a bird left to whistle among the naked branches. But we still hoped to find a few animals roaming about, if we could spot any through the clinging fog. We slowed to a trot and listened for movements. Papa rode ahead on Royale while Suzette sat in front of me on Crimson, clutching her blanket – her “fuzzy woolie”. Still as she was, I kept imagining that her racing heartbeat would frighten off every creature we approached. She had practically bounced up 124 and down when we left the cottage. But Papa instructed her – as he had instructed me on my first hunt – to obey his every command and keep silent in the forest. He put up a hand. I pulled Crimson to a halt. Papa rode Royale a few steps closer, one hoof at a time, his hand still raised to us. Suzette’s pulse thumped against me through her back but she kept still, sucking on her blanket. She would make an excellent hunter one day. As soon as she gave up her fuzzy woolie. My eyes narrowed on the area Papa faced. Then I spotted it: a large white-tailed buck emerging from a cluster of trees, bending to nibble some grass. I might never have noticed it through the dense fog without frightening it away, but Papa had a keen sense for subtle movements. He raised his musket and took aim between the spread antlers. The deer’s head suddenly jerked up as something pounced on top of it. Something large. The enormous shadow spread over the deer, making Suzette scream. I clamped my hand over her mouth as the beast stopped and turned on us. I gasped. It was the wolf, black as night. Its blue-gray eyes stabbed into us as its head rose, as tall as the deer’s neck. The buck staggered to its feet and fled, with the monster chasing it. Papa drove Royale after them. “Papa, stop!” I cried. 125 I tugged on Crimson’s reins. “Hyah!” We galloped after them, my crossbow raised. Suzette squealed and gathered her blanket close to her chest, grasping Crimson’s mane as I goaded him faster. The trees blurred past as I fixed my eyes on Papa and Royale, struggling to keep sight of them rushing through the fog. Ahead of them, I caught shadowy glimpses of the escaping wolf. “Come on, Crimson. Go!” Suzette screamed. “Stop, Helena! Stop!” I ignored her and drove Crimson harder. Royale began to pull away. I barely caught sight of the wolf’s whipping tail. As Crimson leaped over a thick tree root, Suzette slid sideways. She hung from the saddle as we sailed through the air. I yanked on the reins and clutched her to my chest as we toppled over. Crimson fell on my leg like a pile of stones and I screamed. He rose off me instantly, letting my heels slide and fall limply from the stirrups. I lay there and cradled Suzette, trying to stop her from squirming. I bit my lip and waited for feeling to return to my leg. After a few minutes, I managed to calm her down, assuring her I could still walk. My crossbow lay on the ground near my hand. It had fired its bolt when we fell. There was no time to search for it. “Bring me another bolt,” I groaned. Suzette got up quickly, smearing away tears with her blanket. She ran to the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle and returned with a new bolt. I sat on the ground and put my left foot in the crossbow’s loop. I leaned back and tugged 126 the bowstring taut to arm it, thankful to have one strong leg. I crawled to a nearby tree for support and stood to my feet. I limped to Crimson and he nuzzled me with his neck, as I lifted my long skirt to check my injury. The purpling bruise on my thigh and knee would spread over the next few days, but it would heal. A gunshot echoed through the trees. We froze. I grabbed Suzette and lifted her onto Crimson, clenching my teeth against the numbing pain. Gripping the horn tight, I planted my foot in the stirrup and hoisted myself up, swinging my dead leg over his back. Crimson hesitated at first, sensing my injury, but I urged him on and he tore after Papa with all speed. It took less than a minute to reach a clearing where we found the deer. Or rather, its head, ripped from its neck and lying in a pool of blood. There was no body. Near the head, Papa’s musket lay in the dirt, spattered with blood. I blocked Suzette’s eyes with my forearm and stared at Papa’s weapon. Just stared, holding Crimson in position. Unwilling – unable – to move forward. I finally turned Crimson away at a slow canter, leading him and Suzette to some thick brush and trees several yards away. “Wait here.” “Helena. Wasn’t that Papa’s –?” “Wait here, I said!” Suzette sniffed. “Don’t yell.” 127 I cradled her carefully. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to yell. But do as I say. Sit here and keep still.” She sniffed and buried her face in the blanket. “I hate this forest.” I hugged her tight, then swung my leg over the saddle and dropped down. The jarring pain rang all the way from my leg to my neck. I limped all the way back to the clearing to retrieve Papa’s musket. It was still warm. I could smell the gunpowder from its recent shot. He missed shooting whatever attacked him. Or his bullet failed to stop it. Something rustled through the bushes at my left. I dropped the musket and aimed my crossbow at the approaching footsteps. Father Vestille strode from the forest on his Palomino, right into my sight. He flinched as his horse started a little. I lowered the crossbow. “Helena? What –?” “Papa’s missing.” My words came out half-choked. His eyes widened at the bloody musket. He scanned the area. “Which way?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. I didn’t see. Somewhere back that direction.” His face turned to iron. “Take Suzette home and round up some men. Go.” “I’m coming with you.” “Take your sister home!” I bit my lip. I knew he was right. She had already seen too much. But I couldn’t lose the chance to find Papa. 128 I had to trust Father Vestille to find him. I hobbled quickly back to Crimson as Father Vestille galloped off. We raced home, faster than ever. It felt like forever. When we finally reached the cottage, Mama sat waiting on the front stoop, as always. Suzette screamed for her and Mama came running. I left Suzette with her. Suzette babbled, waving her blanket wildly as Mama hugged her tight. Mama turned to me with frantic eyes. “What happened? Where’s your father?” “I don’t know. Father Vestille’s searching for him. I’m going back.” “Helena, wait!” I sped away. I had no time to find more men in the village. Who would I find? Who would listen to me, other than the Leónes? Every moment spent asking for help was another moment lost. We pounded back into the darkness of the forest. A few minutes later, we reached the spot where Father Vestille had met me. I yanked the reins, jarring Crimson to a halt, and listened. Crimson followed my lead and kept still, while my heart beat like a drum. Something wailed. We charged toward it, darting around tree trunks. I ground my teeth, the crossbow in my fist. A dark figure knelt on the ground ahead. Crimson skidded to a halt as I aimed at the man in black. 129 It was Father Vestille, bent over on the ground. Sobbing as he clutched a scarlet cloth to his chest. It was Papa’s tunic. Covered in blood. I smelled the drying puddles of blood scattered throughout the area. I saw pieces of Papa. A scarlet finger. A boot with part of the torn leg still inside. Some piece of indistinguishable flesh lying mangled against a tree trunk. Bile rose at the back of my throat but I stilled it. Crimson snorted and stamped his hooves, sharing my shock and rage. Father Vestille simply wept, doubled over my father’s tunic, rocking back and forth. I searched in all directions, listening, smelling the air. Nothing but pine and decay from my father’s blood. Father Vestille finally rose, clutching Papa’s shirt. He trudged to his horse, hanging his head. His robe covered with Papa’s blood. “We must tell your mother,” he rasped. I kept scanning the trees, kept listening for movement. My grip ached on the crossbow. Something rustled in the bushes. I whirled and fired as a reflex, pinning a small rabbit to the dirt. It let out a pitiful squeal as my bolt pierced its belly. I examined it. Papa would have been impressed by my quick reaction. I studied the rabbit another few seconds. Then bent to grab another bolt from the saddle pouch, loaded it with my left boot, and waited. 130 There were no sounds. Only the bunny’s plaintive cries. No more of Papa’s booming voice, ordering me inside. No more of his smile or his pride in my latest kill. No more of his horsey-rides with Suzette bouncing on his shoulders. No more of his quiet kisses to Mama when he thought we weren’t looking. The forest was still. I dismounted and limped to the rabbit, gritting through the pain. I jammed the bolt deeper and worked it back and forth until the rabbit stopped struggling. I picked it up and tied it to the saddle. “Dinner,” I said as I dragged myself back onto Crimson. “Helena …” Father Vestille began in a broken voice. I met his gaze. “Can’t let good meat go to waste,” I told him, urging Crimson forward. We rode back to the clearing. I pulled Crimson to a halt and climbed down to gather up Papa’s musket. I wiped off some of the blood – Papa’s blood – on my burlap cloak. I cleaned it slowly, thinking about how Papa used his gun. How careful he was in the forest, how quick he was to fire. He must have shot the wolf. But it still killed him. And it still lived, somewhere in the blackness. I secured the musket to Crimson’s saddle beside the hanging rabbit. I mounted, allowing no more tears to start, no time to think. Only to act. I 131 turned at a sudden sound and stared at Father Vestille. “Did you hear that?” He looked about. I had jarred him out of his grief. “I – I don’t know. What did you hear?” I glared at him and wondered if I was going mad. “Perhaps nothing. We should go.” I stared at the path leading out of the forest, setting my jaw. “Don’t want to get caught out after dark.” We turned the horses back to the cottage. But I still felt an unsettling tremor in my spine. I could not possibly have heard what I imagined. Still, I glanced over my shoulder again as we rode toward home. From the dark recesses of the forest, I could have sworn I heard some wild animal laughing. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over Papa’s body. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as though he could see Papa’s face beneath the heavy lid. “Henri Basque – was my dearest friend. A kind man who always looked out for others. Always wanted to provide for others. Protect others. Shelter others. Even in his death, he died protecting his daughters from a dangerous animal as he – as he chased after it.” 132 I sensed people staring at me. I was thankful to have Mama and Suzette beside me, with Pierre and his parents sitting nearby. “Henri and Celeste invited me here after they came and settled, when they saw there had been no priest for several years. They allowed me to stay with them, until I was able to purchase my own hovel. They supported the new church here, attending regularly and helping draw others in. Henri wanted to provide for people’s spiritual needs as well as their material needs. He lived his life providing for others, and he died protecting his daughters.” Mama withdrew one of her embroidered handkerchiefs and dabbed at her bloodshot eyes. She looked too tired to weep anymore. I felt hollow inside as Father Vestille concluded his eulogy. The Mass ended and the casket was carried outside by Monsieur Leóne, Duke Laurent, and four other men. They put thick ropes under the casket and lowered it down into the giant pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Papa’s body there. Pierre stood beside me. “Weird.” I said nothing, but waited for him to continue. “I mean, you’re certain your father wouldn’t have missed. But if he hit the wolf, why couldn’t they find it? It couldn’t have gotten far.” I didn’t answer. I just stared into the dark hole. 133 He cleared his throat. “Sorry, Red. I shouldn’t keep talking about the wolves.” He stepped away to join his parents. I stood stiff and unmoving, saying nothing at all. “I’m so sorry, Madame,” Duke Laurent was telling Mama as he led her gently by the hand. “Henri was one of the best men I’ve ever known.” He had a slight catch in his throat. “If there’s anything I can do for your family, please let me know and it will be done.” “That is very kind of you, Monsieur,” Mama said, sounding frail and numb. She turned tired eyes on me. “Helena. Are you ready to go home?” I nodded, wrapped my burlap cloak around my shoulders, and put an arm around Suzette as she clutched her blanket. We returned home in silence. The Leónes stayed with us that afternoon, along with Father Vestille. I know Mama and Suzette needed their company, but apart from Pierre, I was relieved when they all left before dusk. Leaving the house dark and quiet. Mama wanted to talk to me after she put Suzette to bed but I didn’t feel like talking. I didn’t feel like doing anything at all. I retired early and cried myself to sleep. 134 14. “The beast has returned!” I looked up to see Jacque Denue and his four cronies beside the stoop of the Leónes’ blacksmith shop as I exited with my new crossbow bolts. They stood between me and Crimson, hitched to the post. “Told you this was her horse,” Denue said. He jutted his chin at me. “We told you not to come here anymore, you ugly witch. You deaf or just stupid?” 135 “I’ll leave the stupidity to you, Jacque. Step away from my horse.” “What did you say, you hag? Come here and I’ll beat some sense into you.” “Leave me alone. For your own well-being.” Jacque no longer frightened me, and I was in no mood for his nonsense. As a child, I had longed for Papa to rescue me from this brainless bully. Now, six months after Papa’s death, I had learned to take care of myself, along with Mama and Suzette. I had accompanied them in the forest an hour ago, to provide safe escort to Father Vestille’s hovel in the woods. They wanted me to join them for lunch, but I preferred to hunt. I couldn’t tell them I had no interest in visiting with Father Vestille, despite his frequent invitations over the past several months. Even though Mama said he had made a cake to celebrate my sixteenth birthday. He apparently wished to make up for all the time spent away from us, visiting other provinces the last several years. But I wasn’t interested in his penance. My attention had shifted to more important matters. I had assumed the role of hunter and provider for our family. Mama urged me to rest, to spend more time with them, insisting we had plenty of meat, especially with Father Vestille sharing meals with us. But I kept hunting, kept working. And I kept secretly searching for signs of the wolves that took Papa. But I never found them. They seemed to have gone into hiding, as if 136 frightened by the attention that Papa’s death had brought about. After another fruitless search in the woods, I had driven Crimson into the village of La Rue Sauvage to visit Pierre at his shop. I traded a few kills – a rabbit and three birds – for an order of new crossbow bolts, but lingered a few moments afterward. I had to admit, I found it far easier to make time to visit with Pierre. But entering the village brought its own share of risk, as Jacque Denue and his cruel friends meant to remind me. Denue snorted at a fat boy with food stains on his shirt. “Grab her, Port. I’m gonna give this witch a spanking.” The slob snatched at my arm. I dodged him easily and spun toward him, to hammer my locked fists into his face. He went down hard, but the folds of my skirt bunched around my legs, constricting my movements. As I stepped to one side to free up my movements, a taller boy seized my wrist. His fingers locked on me like a vise and jerked me toward Denue. Denue’s breath smelled of chewing tobacco. I tried to yank myself free but my dress remained twisted, keeping me off-balance. “I dunno how you did that, freak, but you’ll be sorry you did. I’m gonna beat you so bad you’ll never show your face outside again!” He raised his fist. Then something knocked his friend into him, forcing a grunt from Jacque as they both sailed to the ground. I tugged myself free of Muscles and stepped aside. 137 Crimson snorted down at the freckle-faced boy who lay sprawled on top of Denue, grimacing as he massaged his ribs. I felt a wave of relief as Crimson tried to kick at the rest of them. But they backed away from the post where I had tied him. I couldn’t get past them to set him loose. Then Slob picked up a rock and hurled it past my head. “Grab her!” Denue growled. Muscles lunged for me. I dodged, still struggling in my long dress. The others bent to pick up rocks, standing between me and Pierre’s door. I could call for help, but then they would throw rocks at Pierre. I hiked up my skirt and sprinted away. I could outrun them, but I had no place to escape between the closely-packed shops and houses. I hurried down an alley, their feet pounding after me. I crossed the next street and nearly fell beneath the wheels of an approaching carriage. The driver spotted me and jerked on the reins. Behind me, Denue and the others were closing in. I stood and ran to knock on the carriage door, seeing a young family inside. The woman saw my scarred face and screamed. “Please! Help me!” I cried. The man blinked and gaped as the woman pulled a small boy close. Over my shoulder, I glimpsed Jacque Denue and his friends charging toward me. I hurried past the coach and down the next alley. A rock sailed past me, missing my head and striking a wine barrel. 138 “Hey, now, stop that, you boys!” the driver called from behind. But he remained in his high seat as the boys’ feet skittered across the cobbled path. I rushed down the next busy street. “Help!” I called, to anyone who would listen. “Help me!” They all backed away, startled by my manner and my appearance. Men, women, children, all dressed well, all strong and healthy, stepped clear of me. Clearing a path for the boys to chase after me, shouting their threats. “We’re coming for you, Scars!” Jacque sang. “We’re gonna kill you!” one of his friends shouted. I ducked into another alley and glanced over my shoulder. The boys grinned like demons, sprinting after me with rocks in their fists. Ahead of me, the alley was bricked in. I gasped and turned, searching for a way out. I grabbed onto an upper ledge and tried to scale the wall. But my skirt made it impossible. “Trapped like a rat,” Denue said. His gang filled the mouth of the alley. “More like a scar-faced pig, I’d say,” Slob chimed in. Denue tossed a rock up and down in his palm. “This’ll help you remember to keep your ugly face out of our village, Scars.” He hurled it at me. I ducked and it struck the brick wall. Muscles threw another one. I dodged and jumped behind a wine barrel. I sat with my back to it, like a child hiding in a cellar. 139 “Come on out, Scars,” Denue demanded. “Come get your punishment.” Their footsteps strolled closer, taking their time. They threw another rock at the wall to frighten me. Which meant they had gathered enough of them to waste a few. My breath came in rapid gasps. I suddenly remembered the black wolf looming over me, mocking me. Knowing I could do nothing to stop it. Until Francois charged in with his ax and struck it dead. Shove your fear aside, Papa’s voice reminded me, the day I made my first kill. Shove it aside and shoot. I tried not to imagine the boys’ rocks striking my gut. My head. My face. I remembered the voice of my other hero, Francois. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped, he had urged. Stand up and do something. I looked around the empty alley, at the shrapnel of rocks and bricks scattered nearby. A broken wood plank lay among them. I seized it with both hands. I rose. The boys stared with surprise and delight. Denue hurled his rock at my eyes. I slapped it away with the plank and marched at them. Marched at Denue. The others fell silent and stopped. Muscles threw another stone. I smacked it against the wall and it shattered in half. Freckles hurled another one. I slammed it to the ground. 140 “Throw it!” Denue ordered the others. “Gimme the rock, then!” Slob surrendered his stone to Denue as I closed in. He tried to throw it but I smacked his wrist with the plank. He yelped as I jammed the end of the board into his chest and drove him back out of the alley with his friends. We emerged on the open street and I whacked him across the shoulder. He fell to the ground and rolled onto his back. I dropped to my knees in front of him, releasing the plank. The others gaped as I pummeled him with my fists. I continued with single-handed blows, one after the other. Until he lay on the ground, bloody and crying. I stopped. He cringed and whimpered beneath me, shielding his face with open palms. I could have beaten him into a helpless mass, the way he beat me all those years ago. But what would be the point? I stood to my feet. “You’re not the one I want. Just keep out of my way.” I stepped over him and marched back to Monsieur Leóne’s shop. Denue called after me, half-threatening, half-sobbing. “You freak! You’ll regret this, you scar-faced witch! You’ll regret this!” I ignored him. He was flesh and blood, like me. Beneath his savage surface, he was as frightened as the rest of us. I wanted the wolves. I returned to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and the post where I had left Crimson. He 141 snorted and stamped his feet until I released him and stroked his neck. The fire in his eye matched my own. If he had been free to fight, those boys could never have chased me. “I don’t think I’ll tie you up again, friend.” Crimson snorted. I think he understood. 142 15. Something disturbed my senses as I rode through the woods near our cottage. Something in the air. When we emerged from the forest, I understood. All of our sheep lay strewn about our meadow, turned on their sides, unmoving. A gentle breeze from our yard had carried the stench of their drying blood. I urged Crimson forward and he charged toward the house. The front door stood open, as if gaping in shock. No sheep were bleating, and a 143 glance told me that a few of them had likely run off, or been carried away. Those that remained lay in puddles of blood. Valiant lay beside them in his own scarlet stream. My crossbow was already out and loaded for our trip through the woods. I held it high as I leaped down from the saddle. In my hurry, my foot caught in the stirrup and I stumbled to the ground beside the carving table. I scrambled to my feet and ran inside. Pots and pans, clothing and half-cooked food, were scattered everywhere and stained with blood. Mama’s rocking chair lay in splintered fragments on the floor to my left. I smelled Mama’s stew bubbling in its pot on the cast-iron stove. I let it boil. Wind whistled through the house from the half-open rear door. Against the doorframe, a thick smear of blood was spread like tar. My throat went dry. On the floor beneath lay a large shred of Mama’s dress. I ran to it, clutched the fabric to my chest. I raised the crossbow high and kicked the back door open. Splotches of blood formed a trail from the rear stoop, across the grass behind the cottage, continuing toward the stable. Crimson cantered around the cottage to meet me, drawn by the noise at the back door. He noted my intensity and looked to one side, perhaps wondering what I was tracking. He sniffed at the blood and snorted, 144 sounding angry. I followed the scarlet trail to the stable entrance and hurried inside. The mess was everywhere. The walls, the posts, the hay, the troughs. All matted with thick blood. Most of it had collected in Royale’s stall. I moved toward it slowly, trembling. Within the stall, Royale’s saddle lay on its side. Strands of hay stuck to the blood that coated it. Beyond the stall, the rest of my mother’s dress lay in a sickening pile of straw and dark blood. Crimson stood back and stamped his hooves. My legs felt like melting wax as I stepped closer. I found her jewelry and one of her shoes. Nothing more. She had been taken naked, along with Papa’s horse. They had taken everything from us. Everything. Beside Mama’s abandoned dress lay a hand. A tiny skeletal hand. I fell to my knees before it. My crossbow fell to the hay. It landed on something soft and red, but it didn’t sink through the way it would have sunk into straw. I reached into the inky blood that coated the fabric and lifted it slowly. The blood clung to it and wouldn’t let go. It was her blanket. Her fuzzy woolie. I felt the moan gathering in my gut before it reached my throat and became a wail. Suzette. “Celeste! Suzette!” It was Father Vestille’s voice, calling from somewhere near the front of the cottage. I considered calling out to him from the stable. To come find my family’s remains. 145 My mouth would only whimper. Father Vestille’s feet kicked up a flurry of dust as he skidded into the stable. He gaped at me as I knelt beside Royale’s stall, next to the dress and my sister’s hand, holding her bloody blanket. He stood at the entrance beside Crimson, his chest heaving. “Helena. What – happened?” I didn’t answer. He knew what happened. Anyone seeing this would know. But just like Father Vestille, no one would admit to knowing. A wolf howled nearby. Dark rage surged through me and lifted me to my feet. I snatched up Papa’s crossbow and ran past Father Vestille. “Helena, wait!” He ran after me with Crimson trotting along behind. At the edge of the forest, barely hidden among the trees, a wolf stood. Stood. I had not imagined it. The monster stood on its hind legs, even now, and grinned. Mocking me from the woods. I lunged toward it. Father Vestille tackled me and pinned me to the ground. “Helena, no!” He held me down with his full weight, pressing me into the dirt. I strained to rise. To strike at the beast. To fire a bolt into its belly and turn that smile into a grimace of agony. I finally pushed Father Vestille off and rolled aside. I ran at the wolf as it turned to lope away. I heard it laugh as it fled – actually laugh – in a sort of whooping cackle. 146 I charged at the spot where it had stood. I squinted for a sign of its vanishing tail while Father Vestille chased after me. “Stop, Helena, stop!” Crimson galloped from behind me and clomped to a halt, blocking my path. Doing what Father Vestille could not do. Stopping me from rushing straight to my own death. Father Vestille soon reached us. Crimson snorted at me and I stood there, struggling to control my rage. To focus it. Father Vestille wheezed and bent over, his hands on his knees. He wasn’t used to sprinting. “Helena, please,” he gasped. “There’s nothing – you can do.” I stared through tree after dark tree, tracing the wolf’s likely path. “Not yet.” He hung his head. “Helena –.” “You saw it, Father. It stood.” “Stood?” he wheezed. “What, the wolf? No, Helena, no. It must have – must have simply appeared that way – from a distance.” Swallowing, he gathered his breath and straightened. “Helena. We’ll – We can clean up – your cottage. I’ll help – restore it.” He sounded as though he meant to convince himself as much as to console me. “There’s nothing to restore. They took my home. They’ve taken everything.” His eyes narrowed. “Who has taken everything?” “The wolves.” 147 He said nothing at first. He simply stood there, slowing his breathing, studying me. “Helena. You have a home. With me. I’ll stay here if you wish. Or you can come to my hovel. I’ll see to all your needs.” My breath came evenly as I watched the empty woods. The dark forest of wolves that had swallowed up Mama and Suzette. I had to stay angry to keep from screaming. “That’s very kind of you. But I’ll see to my own needs.” The wind whistled between us. “I know you can fend for yourself, Helena. But we all have needs besides food and shelter. Your father and – your mother – they were my closest friends, since before you were born. And you and Suzette …” His voice caught in his throat. “Helena, your family meant everything to me. I will not abandon you. Nor will I let you abandon yourself.” I stood like a statue before the woods. As a child, I always saw Father Vestille as a source of assurance and comfort. But there was no comfort here at the forest’s edge. I scanned its endless blackness for signs of movement. Any signs of the wolf or its companions. Nothing. I turned from it and strode to Crimson, climbing onto his back. I snapped at the reins and galloped past Father Vestille without a word. I returned to the village and rode straight to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. When I threw the 148 door open, Pierre seemed delighted to see me twice in the same day. Then his face fell. “Red? What’s wrong?” “Can I sleep here tonight?” “Of course, Red. We’ll make some room for you in the loft. What happened?” I tried to speak clearly. My voice rattled. “There was an attack. On – our cottage. Mama and Suzette – They’re gone.” The color drained from his face. “Suzette? How –? What happened?” “The wolves. They took my – The wolves took them. They’re gone. Can I sleep here tonight?” “Yes. Sure, I said you could. Just – sit over here. Did anyone else see it?” I walked to the stool he offered, brushed sawdust from it, and sat. Like a horse being led to its stable, without thought or will or emotion. “Father Vestille was there. He’s – He’s been helping out, looking in on us more often, since Papa died. He wants me to stay with him.” Pierre waited for more. “But you don’t want to. Why not?” I pressed my lips tight, feeling my blood boil again. “Red, what is it? Why are you so mad at him?” “Because he did nothing!” I burst. “Grand’Mere died and he did nothing. Francois died and he did nothing. Papa died and he couldn’t stop the wolf, couldn’t even find it. And now –!” I 149 couldn’t speak their names again. Couldn’t say again that I had lost everyone. Even Suzette. “But – he’s trying to –.” “Please, Pierre. Don’t tell me what he’s trying to do. Please don’t tell me people are trying to help, or that the King will send soldiers, or that everything will be all right, because it won’t. Nothing is going to be all right, ever again.” “Red …” I fell into his arms and clung to him. I needed someone who could understand and let me lean against him and cry. Someone who wouldn’t look down on me for my weakness or my irresponsibility or my ugliness. Someone who would let me cry, and never reveal it to anyone if I asked him. I buried my wet cheeks against his chest and sobbed in gulps, craving his comfort. He held me until I finished, then gently released me as I pulled away. He gave me a crooked smile and offered me a rag, beating some sawdust from it. I took it gratefully and wiped my eyes and nose. “This never happened.” He wrinkled his brow. “The hug?” “No. The crying.” “… Why?” “I don’t want anyone to know. And I don’t want to remember.” “Everyone cries, Red.” “I’ve cried enough. I’m through crying.” He narrowed his eyes, not sure what to make of me. “Listen, Red. I’ll let Papa know you’re here and tell him what happened. You’re 150 welcome to stay. I’ll make up the cot for you upstairs and get some blankets so you can rest.” I nodded obediently, feeling numb. As if all the emotion had been drained from my soul. At least, all the emotion I could reveal. My rage, my fear, the storm building inside me – I had to keep these reined in, lest they be fully unleashed. “Let me just add some more wood,” he said, stepping to the large center furnace and grabbing a poker to pull open its grate. A blast of light and heat emitted from within. “You sure you need more fire in there?” I asked dully. He grinned at me over his shoulder. “It’s supposed to storm tonight. Never know when you might need some extra heat.” He chucked a couple of logs into the opening, letting the mighty blaze roar at us before he shut the grate again. He lit a lantern and strode past it to the ladder at the rear of the shop. I followed him up to the loft with wooden movements. We emerged through the square opening. Pierre’s lantern lit the long-forgotten room in a dusty haze. Cobwebs connected the enormous wardrobe on the far wall to a standing mirror, covered in a dusty film. Near the shuttered window stood a cot. I longed to collapse onto it and sleep for hours, as Pierre suggested. My mind and strength were spent. He set the lantern on the nightstand and clomped to the wardrobe, his boots leaving footprints in the floorboard dust as I sneezed twice. 151 He opened the double doors, peeling cobweb strings apart, and bent to lift two thick blankets from a bottom shelf. Among the coats and dresses that hung above the blankets, something flashed a brilliant red. I stepped to the wardrobe and pushed the other garments aside. Behind coats, nightshirts and tunics, covered with dust and age, hung a long red hooded cloak. Just like the one Grand’Mere Marie made for me when I was little. The cloak I was forbidden to wear after the attack. I pulled it out. “That was Mama’s,” Pierre said. I kept staring at it. “Sorry,” I mumbled. “No, it’s all right. It’s beautiful, I know. Like the one you used to – uh, here. You should be warm enough with these.” The hood and cloak looked roomy, slightly too large for me. But they would fit. “I want this.” Pierre turned to me. “Huh? Oh. Sure, I’ll ask Papa. No one’s using it, so it shouldn’t be –.” “I want this,” I repeated. “I’ll give you anything you want for it.” “Red, you can have it. But you should get some rest.” I couldn’t take my eyes off the cloak. The red hooded cloak. I had not worn anything red since before I started hunting. Since the wolves took all peace and happiness from our lives. Now they had taken our lives, too. Grand’Mere and Francois and my parents. Even Suzette. For the first time, I had known some of the joy my mother 152 always wanted for me. To feel like a mother, or at least a big sister. And they had taken it away. I clutched the cloak to my chest. Then I moved to the cot. “I’ll use this as well. To keep warm.” “All right,” Pierre allowed. I sat on the cot. “Father Vestille will plan a service for my mother and – my sister. Can you find out the time and have someone wake me?” “Of course.” I clutched the cloak in my fist and admired it once more. “I’ll wear this to the service.” Pierre frowned. “We might have a black veil you can use. I don’t think you can wear red for a funeral.” I flashed on him. “Don’t tell me what to wear.” He studied me, then shrugged: “Red it is,” he said. “Get some sleep.” I lay down, wrapped the red cloak around myself and pulled the blankets up as Pierre returned to the ladder. I sat up. “Pierre?” His head poked up through the square opening. “Thank you,” I said. He smiled and gave a nod, then descended through the hole. I blew out the candle and the room sank into darkness. 153 16. Where are you going, little girl? I saw myself walking through the woods and tensed. The same woods I traveled as a child. I was on my way to Grand’Mere Marie’s house again, carrying a basket of bread and cheese. But I was myself, sixteen years old. I knew I was having a nightmare, but I couldn’t wake up. “Where are you going, little girl?” a gruff voice repeated from the forest. 154 I peered through black trees, thick as a fortress gate. A pair of low eyes studied me. The creature came slowly between the trunks, a thick shadow of black fur and pointed ears. Eyes shone from the shadow, a pale bluish-gray. The large wolf came into view, still lingering behind a few trees. I stepped backward, my heart racing. “Don’t be afraid,” it said. “… You’re a wolf.” The shadow nodded. It seemed to grin. “Wolves don’t talk.” I clutched the basket to my chest and took another step back. As if I could disappear within the folds of my cloak. “I do,” it said. “Where are you going, little girl?” A chilling breeze tickled my cheeks. My voice was barely a breath. “To my Grand’Mere’s house.” “And where does she live?” “… just over the hill, past the three oaks.” My eyes locked on the furry shadow as my fingers locked around the basket’s handle. “I’ve never seen a wolf like you.” “No?” Its voice was sheer mockery. I shook my head. I wanted to run, to scream. But my legs stiffened in place like a terrified fawn. The wolf stood taller than me, as it had appeared when I was only seven. Its head was half the size of my body. “You have – such big eyes. And ears. And such big teeth.” His fangs spread with pleasure. “The better to see and hear you with, Mademoiselle.” 155 I heard my breath flowing in and out. In and out. “… And your teeth?” It leaned toward me. It kept leaning in as it padded closer, closer. “The better to eat you!” I clutched the basket and raised it to protect my face. To hide my eyes from its open, dripping mouth. A sharp crack sounded over the hill. It was Grand’Mere’s neighbor, Francois, splitting wood with his ax. He would hear if I screamed. The wolf regarded me casually. “We’ll meet again, Mademoiselle. Soon. But keep silent about our first meeting.” It raised its paw to its pursed lips, as if signaling me to be quiet. The way a human would. “Now run to your Grand’Mere’s. Before she starts to worry.” The wolf turned and loped away. Beyond it, the eyes of six other wolves shone in the distance. Watching and waiting. I backed away carefully as they remained in their positions like sentinels. I hurried off through the trees. As I ran, I noticed the first wolf nearby, keeping pace with me. Its enormous black figure loped gently at first. Then it bounded through the woods, leaving me far behind. It was headed to Grand’Mere’s. I gasped and ran harder. About ten minutes later, I finally reached her cottage and threw open the door. Inside, on Grand’Mere’s bed, the wolf circled about her sheets and nightgown, smeared with her blood. It turned toward me and smiled. 156 It jumped down from the bed, padding toward me. I had rushed too far into the cottage to retreat in time. I ran behind Grand’Mere’s rocking chair to shield myself. The black wolf stood on its hind legs and knocked the chair aside like a toy. It loomed over me, eyes shining, and spread its claws. I jumped back from it. Its claws still connected, cutting into the tender flesh of my forehead and cheeks. I spun and fell back. My own blood flew about my head. Then it dripped into a scarlet pool on Grand’Mere’s wooden floor where I fell. The open wound burned like fire. I screamed but I couldn’t hear myself. Couldn’t think of anything but the wolf as it dropped to all fours. The monster prowled closer, its open mouth salivating. Something kicked open the front door. Francois Revelier burst in, carrying his ax in two fists like a hammer of judgment. He rushed at the giant wolf and raised his weapon. Its silver edge caught the sunlight from the door and flashed with blinding light. He brought the heavy blade down as the beast charged, striking its shoulder and knocking it to the floor. The wound trickled blood as the wolf struggled to rise. Then it stumbled, confused, and fell. Fell to the floor and didn’t move. Francois squinted at it, looking perplexed. The wolf’s vacant eyes no longer blinked. Francois set his jaw and stomped forward. He lopped off the monster’s head with one clean stroke. The wolf lay there in its own blood, still 157 and horrible and harmless, while Francois stood over it like David over the head of the slain Goliath. In that instant, I learned that heroes existed. People who would risk their own lives to save mine. People like Francois. Something growled from outside. At each window, the head of another large wolf eyed us. The same wolves that studied me from the forest. Francois turned as they burst through the openings. They leaped on top of him and bit into his back, his shoulders, his arms. Francois dropped his ax and screamed as he sank to his knees beneath the bloodthirsty pile. Then the head of the first wolf – the one Francois has slain – turned again to smile at me. Then – impossibly – its head slid back to its body to rejoin its neck, re-forming itself. It stood on its hind legs again and grinned at me in triumph. Then it joined the others feeding on Francois as he flailed his arms and shrieked. I jerked upright in bed and whirled about in the blackness, trying to focus. I relaxed my neck and shoulders in the dark room. On the cot in the loft above the blacksmith’s shop, where Pierre let me sleep. I was alone. No beasts or monsters. Only me and my scars. I lay back down and drew the red cloak back around myself. The cloak that belonged to Pierre’s mother, before she died. I pulled the blankets up to my shoulders and lay there on the warm cot, wide-eyed and shivering. 158 17. “Red?’ Pierre’s head popped up through the hole in the loft floor. I pulled the dress up in front of my bare shoulders and gasped. He spotted me standing in nothing but my linen chemise, before I covered myself with his mother’s cream-white gown. He immediately lowered his gaze. “Uh, sorry, Red. I just – I noticed you lit the candle and you were up, so – Just wanted to let you know Father Vestille’s 159 preparing for burial. People are already heading to the church.” “All right,” I said, still clutching the dress. “My clothes were covered in blood. I hope you don’t mind me borrowing one of your mother’s gowns.” He cleared his throat. “Yeah. Sure. No problem.” I waited. “I’m just dressing now.” “Right. Yeah. Of course. I’ll just, uh – wait down in the shop.” “Yes, you will.”",

PRAISE FOR The Red Rider Saga (from previous editions) “I got sucked in from the beginning. … I was up all night reading, imagining and feeling for this poor girl … heartbreak and twists and adventure all rolled into one. … This is a book to let a young woman read to teach about inner strength and what one young girl can do against so many odds. That one action can accomplish so much. This book gets my absolute seal of approval. I could even picture this story on the big screen! Angi Burns ~Rabid Readers Book Blog ( ( ( “Get ready to see the classic tale reimagined as you’ve never seen it before. … transforming a children’s fairy tale into a supernatural action thriller with a Zorro-style vigilante.” A.K. Preston, author of The Gevaudan Project ( ( ( “A thrilling paranormal Red Riding Hood. … a well-written retelling with a twist and a much stronger Red. … would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal thrillers or reimagined fairy tales. C.S. Wachter, author of The Sorcerer’s Bane ( ( ( 1 “Action filled novel. Journey of a teenage girl. A story of love, courage, friendship and more. The author has got it all in this book.” Jay Deb, author of The Assassin ( ( ( “[Randall]’s unauthorized sequel to Little Red Riding Hood blends great characters with a compelling storyline and places it in the middle of a legendary premisè… a well-told story about seeking justice rather than revenge and finding a way to properly overcome evil. What I liked best about this tale was that this little girl was a flawed character—and she seemed to have all rights to believe the way she believed and think the way she thinks—but [Randall] is careful not to glorify the fact she wants revenge. In fact, the story is about Red learning through her quest to destroy the wolves that revenge will, in fact, destroy herself. It’s a big concept and [Randall] does it well.” Josh Olds, Life is Story ( ( ( “There are stories with great writing styles. Those that have amazing plots. Those that sustain your attention with every word. Ones that exceed your expectations of great lines, with a satisfying ending. Mr. [Randall] accomplished all of these aspects. I can only hope that the right person will come across The Red Rider and turn it into a movie that is sure to be a box-office hit.” Kym McNabney, Story Contributor, Childhood Regained: Stories of Hope for Asian Child Workers by Jodie Renner and Steve Hooley 2 WHAT READERS ARE SAYING (from previous editions) “Full of thrilling discoveries and heart-pounding adventure!

Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. A fantastic twist on the original Red Riding Hood. Helena is my hero.” ( ( ( “Fantastic, suspenseful retelling of Red Riding Hood. A story of wolves and black magic. How the beautiful, innocent child Helena, becomes the physically scarred, determined, skillful hunter of wolves. How the stuff of nightmares becomes reality for a whole community, and a young woman's strength and overwhelming desire to completely destroy the terror that haunts her dreams and waking moments. Powerful imagery, wonderful storytelling. I thoroughly recommend it.” ( ( ( “Definitely not what I expected. There were plenty of twists and turns packed into this book. A good read for any fairytale/fantasy lover.” ( ( ( “While the story takes place in France a long time ago, it has a contemporary feel to it, and the story moves quickly. You find yourself rooting for the main character. I'll certainly buy the next [D.A. Randall] novel if it's as good as this one.” ( ( ( 3 “The Red Rider is a well written book full of adventure, mystery, twists and turns with a fair amount of moral teachings included. This is a book that would be excellent for young teens and adults alike.” ( ( ( “If you enjoyed Little Red Riding Hood as a child, you will love this book. It has mystery, adventure, and suspense. Once you start to read it you won't be able to stop until you finish it. This is the first time I have read anything by this author but he has found a fan of his writings. He is an amazing storyteller.” ( ( ( “Imagine Little Red Riding Hood being scarred by her traumatic encounter with the big bad wolf, and imagine that the big bad wolf ‘isn't a wolf.’ Then let her grow into an angry teenager, give her a red cape, a reloading crossbow and a grappling hook, and gallop with her on her one-supergirl-war against a coven of big bad wolves. The Red Rider is a teen action-fantasy hero and that is how the novel reads. No spoilers here: The suspense with author [D.A. Randall] is just how dark this fantasy will turn, as he takes the white-washed premise of the Brothers Grimm and gets much, much grimmer. A great fit with the grown-up fairy-tale versions of recent years that has emerged in print and film. I recommend it with pleasure. ( ( ( 4 5 RED RIDER RISING by D.A.

RANDALL NEWSLETTER RANDALL ALLEN DUNN ACTION THRILLERS 11 MY SCARS 12 13 1. I never meant to become this. The lazy breeze made my red hooded cloak waft about my shoulders as I sat atop my horse, my cheeks warmed by the consuming blaze. The same gentle wind lifted the roaring flames higher and higher, racing through every inch of the building. I could do nothing to silence the screams of the men inside as they shouted my name. The name they had given me. “Rider! Rider!” Nothing to change what I had become. 14 It was not entirely my choice. I had not started this war, nor had I planned to become a sixteen-year old warrior. I started out as a little girl, innocent as any other. Enjoying life, enjoying my family, anticipating a happy future. Until they had disrupted my entire world, nearly a decade ago … “Hit her again, harder!” Egged on by his friends, Jacque Denue had smiled and rammed his fist into my gut. The jarring pain had shaken my prone body, making me want to vomit. I held back the bile, since the other four boys had me pinned and I didn’t want to swallow it back down my throat. At least the early morning rain had muddied the ground enough for me to sink into it, while it ruined my little dress and burlap cloak. When would Papa come back with the wagon? I was too hoarse to scream any more. I could only raise an arm or a leg as much as they let me, curling into a weak ball to protect myself. The village boys laughed as they took turns punching at my stomach, chest, arms, groin and face. My horrible, scarred face that helped them justify their attack. “You sick, ugly witch!” Jacque spat. “You stay out of La Rue Sauvage, you hear? Stay out of our village!” His palm weaved around my arms and slapped me. Tiny lights swirled about my face as 15 the sting settled into my cheek. I wanted to sleep. To sleep forever and make them go away. “Monster!” one boy yelled. “Disgusting hag!” shouted another. I stopped trying to rise from beneath them. I shut my eyes, accepting blow after blow, my arms and legs burning with bruises. I no longer saw them. I saw myself and the image they so hated. The seven-year old girl with blonde hair and blue eyes and three thick scars slashed across her face. They ran at a slant, like torn pink ribbons. The top one started above my left eye and ended below my right. The second ran below my left eye and scraped across my distorted nose. The last tore across my left cheek and my mouth, ending beneath the enlarged right portion of my lower lip. No wonder they called me a monster. My mind pictured something else as they kept hammering my stomach. I saw the wolf, large and leering and unstoppable, its jaws opening wide to swallow me. The wolf that stood on its hind legs and loomed over me. The living nightmare that spoke to me through its grinning fangs: Where are you going, little girl? I found my voice and screamed. “Helena!” “Run!” the boys shouted. The pain stopped – or at least, stopped mounting - replaced by a scuttling and sloshing of feet through mud puddles and fallen leaves. “Helena! What have you boys done? Come back here, you!” 16 I kept my eyes shut and lay still, sobbing but relieved. Papa would stop them. He would chase them, punish them, his blue eyes blazing with rage above his thick black moustache. He would catch every last one of them and make them sorry for hitting me. Strong arms surrounded me. They snatched me up, then slowed to cradle me. “Helena.” Papa’s voice broke. “Helena.” “Papa,” I rasped, too weak to hug him. I winced out tears as he held me, keeping my eyes closed, until I could breathe regularly again. “Did you get them?” His chest sighed. “They ran away.” “All of them? You didn’t catch any?” My voice croaked like a frog’s. “Helena, I’m taking you to Doctor Renoire.” He rushed me to the next street where we had left our wagon. I had wandered off to smell some flowers outside another shop, when the boys started hurling insults and chased me through the alley. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa cradled me closer as he sloshed across the muddy path. My burlap cloak scraped against my bare shoulders where my dress had been torn. “I’m taking you to the doctor,” he said. “Am I dying?” “No, Helena. You’re not dying.” “After we’re done – I want to see him.” “I’ll think on it. Lie still.” He laid me down on the hay in the bed of our wagon, pushing aside the pumpkins and squash 17 he had purchased to make room. I heard Papa’s horse, Royale, snort his readiness from the front. Soon we were rolling and jostling along the dusty road, so much smoother than the hills outside our distant cottage. So smooth … And I was so scarred. 18 2. I still felt pain, stinging my stomach and face and between my legs, as I lay on the cot in the visiting room. But Doctor Renoire had cleaned me with soft cloths and lotion that took away most of the soreness. Soonafter, I had been able to sit up and eat some of the crackers he kept in his house. He and Papa had left me alone to rest. I laid there as I had been told. Until I heard them talking out in the parlor. I slid down from the cot, wincing at new aches knifing into my thighs and lower back. My 19 ripped, muddy dress had been thrown away. I now wore a pair of boy’s trousers and a shirt, which Doctor Renoire had borrowed from his son’s wardrobe. Only one item had been rescued, and lay on the table beside the cot. My burlap cloak. At least the dark bloodstain in the center gave it some color. I pulled it about my shoulders and hobbled to the door, the wooden floor chilling my bare feet. I peered through the crack and listened. Papa leaned forward in a chair, burying his face in his hands. Doctor Renoire kept a hand on his shoulder. “Relax, Henri,” he said. “Helena’s going to be all right.” Papa sat up and wiped away tears. “This is why. This is why we don’t come out any more. Why we can’t.” “Because of her face?” “No. Not exactly. I just don’t want her suffering any more harm.” My cloak scraped my bruised forearm as I draped it tighter about myself. Doctor Renoire stared at the floorboards. “When Father Vestille brought her in last spring – I had never seen anything like it. At least, not anyone who survived. And certainly no child.” My breath grew quick and shallow. My skin bristled at the memories that still filled my nightmares. The wolf that spoke to me in the forest, that killed Grand’Mere Marie and tried to kill me. The wolf that was anything but a wolf. 20 Doctor Renoire knelt before my father. “Perhaps it’s distasteful to say, but you really should be so grateful, Henri. Just grateful to have her.” “I know. We are. That’s why we can’t let her go out. Not until we can know this won’t happen again.” My foot shuffled against the floor. They both turned. I opened the door slowly as if I had just arrived. Papa quickly wiped his face. “Helena. How do you feel?” “A little better.” “Come here, Helena,” Doctor Renoire beckoned, still kneeling. I limped toward him, feeling some of my strength returning. “That’s it. Good girl. You’re walking fine. You just need to rest up for a few days. Your father agreed to let you skip some chores the next few weeks while you recover. But you should be up and around in no time. Nothing seems to be broken and you’re already moving around much better.” They smiled. They seemed to be waiting for me to respond in kind, so I smiled back. “You know, Helena,” Doctor Renoire continued. “I’ve never seen a girl recover so quickly. You survived six months ago and again today. You’re fortunate to be alive, both times. You’re a true miracle.” My smile faded. “I don’t feel like a miracle.” 21 I clutched at my sore ribs as we trudged through the leaves littering the cobblestone street. I was eager to barter for a new dress at the village clothier and return the trousers that felt so strange, clinging to my legs and exposing them in public. We rarely visited the brick shops and stone houses of La Rue Sauvage. It seemed aptly named now: “Wild Street”. I had begged Papa to take me with him today, but he would never allow it again. Perhaps my parents were right to keep me close to home, never venturing too far outside. Where the wolf might be waiting. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa said nothing at first. “You need to rest. We came to the village. That should be enough excitement for one day, don’t you think?” I heard laughter and flinched. A few men strolled by in front of us, chuckling. Not Jacque Denue or his friends. “I want to see Francois. Please, Papa.” He sighed. “I’ll think on it. Let’s focus on finding a new dress.” We arrived at the clothier and stepped up onto its stoop. The store sign suddenly flipped over to show it now closed as the front door slammed. Papa held my hand and stood in the empty street, staring at the shop door. The sign above the door read: Clothier de Denue. I never knew Jacque’s father sold clothes. He must have heard about what happened. Now he wouldn’t speak to us, out of shame. Or fear. Papa’s hand tightened on mine. His moustache twitched as he clenched his jaw, before 22 he turned me away from the closed door. “Come on, Helena.” I glanced back at the shop. An eye peered out from a crack in the window shutter. Then it disappeared. “We’re not getting a dress?” “Your mother can make you a quick one, perhaps by tomorrow. We’ll ask Doctor Renoire to let us keep these clothes another week. We’re going to see Francois.” My heart soared. “Oh, thank you, Papa!” I nearly threw my arms around him. Then I slowed myself to hug him without upsetting the pain in my ribs. He knew I needed to visit Francois, especially today. Sometimes Francois was the only person who could make me feel safe. Especially when I remembered the wolf. Papa marched to the wagon without a word. He studied the noonday sun. He never let me travel all the way from La Rue Sauvage to Francois’ cabin this late in the day, for fear of being out after dark. He never felt anything was worth that risk. We had to hurry. I tightened my burlap cloak against a draft, scraping my bruises. I glanced back at the shop to see the eye staring at me again before it vanished. Jacque Denue’s father was smart to stay hidden. Papa was no coward. But why didn’t he even knock on the door when we both knew Monsieur Denue was there? Why didn’t he kick the door open and make him give me a new dress for the way his son treated me? Why wouldn’t anyone help me? 23 3. As our wagon rolled up the muddy path to his cabin, I spotted Francois chopping wood outside and smiled. I loved watching his strong arms hammer down on a log with his silver ax. He was a burly man with a round belly and a scraggly beard that crinkled up in a grin whenever he saw me. A wave of warm sunshine bathed me from inside. For the first time since I saw him last month, I felt as though nothing could harm me. Papa tugged Royale to a stop. I wanted to scramble down from the wagon without waiting 24 for permission. But the pain in my side and my legs nearly slowed me to a halt. “Easy, Helena,” Papa said. I hobbled over to Francois as fast as I could, ready for him to scoop me up into his broad arms like always. He thumped his ax into the wood and hurried to me with a fat smile. “Well, well, Helena! What brings you all the way out here?” he boomed. He frowned upon seeing me limp and the pants I now wore. “What happened?” I started to tell him, but I couldn’t. I fell against him and wept, letting my itchy cloak fall to the mud. He hoisted me into the air, but didn’t swing me around in a big circle. Instead, he cradled me like a bear holding a tiny cub. I nuzzled against his warm chest, covered with wooden chips and dust. He patted my back and hugged me. With his heavy arms, who needed a cloak? “It’s all right, Mademoiselle. It’s all right.” “Some boys in the village,” I blubbered. “They chased me and hit me and wouldn’t stop.” “Andre Denue’s son and some of his friends,” Papa said, striding up from behind. “He wouldn’t even open his door to let us buy a new dress. These are from Doctor Renoire’s son.” I sniffed and swiped a tear from my cheek, brushing one of my triple scars. “They called me a monster.” Francois’ hands clenched against my back, then relaxed. “You’re no monster. You just had some bad luck, that’s all. Don’t pay no attention to 25 those morons. Sounds to me like a bunch of no-good bullies.” “I wish you’d been there. Papa let them get away.” Francois held me a moment longer. Then he gently set me down and knelt before me. His eyes looked worried. “Now listen, Helena. If I’d been there, I couldn’t have done anything more than what your father did.” I glanced back to see Papa staring at the ground. I started to tremble. I never meant to dishonor him. I just wanted someone to protect me. Francois’ large finger turned my chin back toward him. “I’m betting your father took you straight to the doctor, didn’t he? And you’re here in one piece. Aren’t you? I expect he was more concerned about treating your wounds than getting revenge.” My face screwed up with tears again. I fell against Francois and sobbed. Ashamed of the way I had spoken about Papa. Angry at Jacque Denue and his friends for nearly beating me to death. And terrified of facing them – or anyone – again. Afraid of showing my horrid face. “Helena. Your cloak,” Papa said. I turned. He held the burlap cloak out to me. I took it with a faint smile, then draped it back in place, careful to keep it from scraping my shoulders too much. Francois patted my back. “Dry your tears now. I’m glad you came today. Been wanting to 26 show you something, next time I saw you. Come on back.” He wiped my eyes with the tail of his thick tunic. I smeared away the rest with the back of my fist. He led me like a lamb, his large hand around my shoulder, toward the rear of his stable. I smiled, eager to see Francois’ ebony horse, Lightning, named for the jagged stripe that covered her nose. I always felt better after petting her. As we came around the corner, Lightning lifted her head lazily. A colt jerked its head from beneath her. It rose to face us, stamping its hooves in protest. Its flanks were red like flame. I gaped. “What’s that?” “That,” he said, “is our new colt.” Its blazing eyes locked on mine. “She’s red!” I squealed. My cloak fell off my shoulders again as I hobbled forward. “Whoa! Stop!” Francois shouted as Papa also yelled behind him. I limped to the gate as fast as I could. The fiery colt reared back, then ran at me. “Helena!” Papa cried. Francois tugged me back as the colt stamped and kicked at the gate. “Easy now, that colt’s a wild one. Understand? Don’t move too quick around it, you’ll pay for it.” I stared into the colt’s eyes. It did look dangerous, but that seemed all right somehow. It didn’t seem mean, just frightened and ready to fight. The same way I felt, except I didn’t have 27 hooves to kick against a gate. “Let me give her some oats.” “Helena …” Papa started. “I don’t know, Helena,” Francois said. “It’s still a little fired up.” “I can do it. I’ll be careful.” After a silent moment, Papa nodded to Francois. “All right, if you walk up with her.” Francois led me to the feed bag hanging outside the stable. He dug out a handful of oats and emptied some into my hand. “Now you let me go first,” he said. We stepped toward the colt, slow and steady. It watched our every move, looking curious, as I hobbled forward with a smile. Francois opened his hand and extended it beneath the colt’s mouth. The colt snorted and tossed its head. Then it bent, sniffed, and nibbled like one of Papa’s sheep. “See, she’s sweet,” I said. I lifted my open palm with my oats, careful not to startle the colt. It stared at me for several seconds. Then it nibbled from my hand. It tickled. When all the oats were gone, it buried his nose in my hand and nuzzled. I took a step closer, moving slow and gentle. It gave a low snort from somewhere in its belly, as a warning. I smiled and took another small step. It let me edge closer. Then I gently curved my hand around to stroke its jaw, and it relaxed. It took a half-step closer and bent its head to let me pet it. I laid my head against the colt and hugged it with both arms. “She likes me.” “Would you look at that?” Francois said, sounding surprised. “But ‘she’ is a ‘he’.” 28 “How do you know?” “Just trust me, all right? So. Now you’ve got him settled, what do you think we should name him?” My eyes lit up. “Crimson. His whole flank is crimson like fire.” It was my favorite word for red. Papa’s face wrinkled at that as he held my burlap cloak. Though he looked more pained than offended. “Then ‘Crimson’ it is,” Francois said, petting the colt as he grew calmer. “And you can help me take care of him.” I looked up at him. “I can? You mean it?” “You come out as often as you like, Helena. When you’re older, I’ll teach you to ride him.” My heart raced. Women rode in carriages, not on horses, and I had never heard of a girl learning how to ride. I leaned against him and threw my arms around his belly, squeezing him tight. “Thank you. Thank you, Francois.” He turned toward Papa, licking his lips. “If it’s all right with your father, that is.” I looked back. “Can I, Papa?” Papa looked pale. He wrung the burlap cloak in his hands. “We’ll see. When you’re a little older.” I hobbled to Papa and fell onto him in a tight hug. I limped back to Crimson, who continued to study my awkward movements, and petted him again. He leaned his head down and 29 stared at me as though we could see into one another’s souls. 30 4. Crimson lifted his head and snorted. I released him as another horse whinnied in the distance. I hobbled toward Papa to peer around the corner of Francois’ stable. A beautiful black coach was rolling across the muddy path to the cabin. Papa’s voice rose. “Were you expecting Duke Laurent?” Francois arrived behind us. “Last person I’d be expecting out here. ‘Course, I didn’t expect to see you today, either.” 31 Duke Laurent ruled the province, but he and Papa had become good friends. He always gave me the most delicious apples and pears whenever he visited Papa. He made me feel almost as safe as Francois. As the adorned coach drew closer, I spotted a gray Palomino trotting behind it amidst the falling leaves. I smiled, recognizing the black cloak and hat of its rider. “Or Father Vestille?” Papa asked. Francois craned his neck forward and gaped. “Next to last person I’d expect. Unless he’s short on confessions. I’m sure I could fill his plate, if he’s feeling lonely.” Papa lowered his chin. “Show respect, Francois.” Francois raised his hands. “Sorry.” Father Vestille didn’t always make me feel safe, but he always smiled and bent down to listen to me after the Sunday Mass. When I was little, he let me sit on his lap whenever he came to visit us. Every time I talked with him, I completely forgot about my scars. The royal coach arrived first. I watched closely as the driver stepped down from his perch to open the rear door. I always felt proud knowing Papa was friends with the Duke of La Rue Sauvage himself. Duke Laurent jumped down and nodded his thanks to the driver, then gaped at us with wide eyes. He ran to Papa, ignoring the mud that splattered on the fine wool-lined coat Mama had made for him. “Henri, are you both all right? I 32 heard there was some trouble in the village. Doctor Renoire said you went home, but we saw the tracks leading here.” Papa shook his hand. “She’s all right. Doctor Renoire said she just needs to rest.” Duke Laurent regarded me with pitiful golden-brown eyes, which made him look even more handsome. He knelt before me, kissing both my hands as if I was a princess. “Helena. I’m so glad you’re all right.” “I am. It still hurts, though.” “I’m sure it does. But you’ll get well. Just rest, like your father says, and you’ll be up and about in no time.” “Monsieur,” Papa said. “May I introduce Francois Revelier?” The Duke stood as Papa and Francois bowed their heads. “The man who saved Helena last year?” He took a step back to view Francois’ full height and size. “Such bravery should not go unnoticed. If I were back at the court in Versailles, you would receive a medal for protecting one of our precious citizens. I can’t provide that, but I believe a banquet in your honor is long overdue.” My heart leaped as Francois gaped at him. “Well, uh – thank you. Your Majesty. Er, Your Grace.” The Duke smiled. “You may call me ‘Monsieur’. Or ‘Leopold’, if you prefer.” Francois shook his hand. “Think it’ll have to be ‘Monsieur’. Wouldn’t feel right using the first name of royalty.” 33 “I’m not all that royal anymore,” Duke Laurent joked. “Any news from the King?” Papa asked. The Duke’s face fell. He glanced down at me, then back at Papa, spreading his hands. “He still refuses to answer my letters. I’ve tried, Henri. I can implore him to send some men, but – .” “I know,” Papa said. “You have no authority with Versailles.” Duke Laurent shrugged and shook his head. “The perils of losing favor with the royal court. I’m fortunate to be given oversight here. I only wish I could provide better security for --.” He glanced down at me and stopped himself. “… for our province.” Papa heaved a sigh. “We need soldiers, Monsieur Laurent. There must be someone we can appeal to. Someone to make the King see reason.” “I’m afraid the only one who can change the mind of the King toward me and our province is the King. I’ve asked. I’ve pleaded. I’ve begged.” His eyes burrowed into the ground. “I don’t even know whether they open my appeals or if they immediately discard them upon seeing my name.” Papa whirled away with clenched fists. He unclenched them quickly as Father Vestille strode toward us, the sun glinting off of his bald head. “Abier, how are you?” Papa said, shaking hands. “You know Francois, of course.” Father Vestille nodded to Francois. “Of course.” Francois smiled, with less than his usual warmth. “Well, we’re not on a first name basis.” 34 “Perhaps we should be,” Father Vestille said. “I haven’t even spoken to you since --. Well, since Spring.” He glanced at me the same way Duke Laurent had. As if I didn’t remember what Francois did for me this past spring. He knelt before me with open arms. I hugged him tight. “What are you doing here?” “I heard there was a commotion in the village. I came to see you.” He lowered his chin, his forehead creasing with worry. “Are you all right?” I nodded, feeling better. Safer, even. “I saw you weren’t at home, so I followed the tracks here. I told Celeste I would find you both. I, ah –.” He raised his eyebrows at Papa. “I didn’t tell her anything else. Figured you’d want to share that.” Papa nodded. “Thank you.” “Did you hear what happened?” I asked. “Doctor Renoire found me and told me about it. I’ll have a talk with Andre Denue tomorrow, see if I can find out who the other boys were,” he said, more to Papa than to me. “Are you going to excommunicate Monsieur Denue?” I asked, hopeful. “Or Jacque?” Father Vestille blinked. “I don’t think I’ll need to do that, Helena. I would rather give them both a chance to make amends.” “But they beat me. And they wouldn’t stop. You have to do something.” 35 “I will. I plan to talk to every one of them about what they’ve done. And help them understand the wrong of it.” I shook my head. “That won’t help. You need to punish them, to make sure they can’t do it again. You have to hurt them the way they hurt me. You should –!” “Helena,” Papa interrupted with a scowl. “That’s enough.” “Yes, leave the punishments to me, Helena,” Duke Laurent broke in. “After all, maintaining order is the role of government. Not the church.” Father Vestille looked sideways at the Duke and frowned. “Yes, that is true. Tell me, what is being done about these occasional – attacks?” “All that the King will allow, which isn’t much, I’m afraid. As far as France is concerned, we’re on our own.” Father Vestille wrinkled his brow. “So the King plans to let La Rue Sauvage fend for itself? He refuses to lift a finger to help us?” “Your words, not mine, Father,” Duke Laurent replied. Father Vestille stepped toward him, looking annoyed, as Papa moved between them. I fidgeted, eager to avoid their argument. “I want to see Crimson again,” I told Francois. “Sure thing,” Francois boomed. “Right this way. We’ll let these gentlemen continue their civil conversation on their own.” He cast an amused 36 glance over his shoulder, and I saw Papa sour at him as we trudged to the rear of the stable. Crimson stood by the gate and lifted his head as we returned, still focused on me. I limped back to the feed bag to give him some more oats. “It’s all right, Crimson. Just Papa talking with Duke Laurent and Father Vestille. Nothing to be afraid of.” I watched the oats disappear from my hand as he nibbled. My sides still ached, but I felt numb inside. Numb and helpless, with no one to protect me from Jacque Denue and his friends. Or from anything else. “Francois? How often do you get scared?” “I dunno. Now and then. Everybody gets scared sometimes.” I stroked Crimson’s flank. “I feel like I’m scared all the time.” He didn’t answer right away. “What’re you scared of?” “That the wolf might come back.” He shuffled his feet in the grass. “Hard to come back if he’s dead.” I pictured its horrible image again. Its monstrous head. Its jagged ears. Its fanged smile. “I heard there were other attacks. Didn’t the wolf kill some other people, too?” Francois paced to one side, then back toward me. “That was before. Figure it was that same wolf. Sure, there have been other attacks, by wolves or some other animals. But you don’t need to worry about that big, bad wolf anymore. He’s gone forever.” 37 “Were you scared when you killed him?” “‘Course I was. But sometimes there are things more important than being scared. Things you’ve got to stand up and fight for.” “Like trying to save Grand’Mere?” “Yeah. And looking after you. I mean, if I hadn’t gone in after that wolf – well, he would’ve gotten you, too. Can’t let being scared stop you from doing what’s right. If everybody stays scared, who’s gonna protect us?” I knew he was right. But the wolf was monstrous. And I was just a girl that older boys beat on. “Francois. Can you teach me to fight?” His eyes bulged. “Uhhh, now why would you want to learn that, Helena?” I cocked my head at him. “You know why. So I can beat up Jacque Denue instead of him beating on me.” He frowned. “I’m not sure that’s the answer to your problem, Helena. Certainly not the answer your father would give you.” “That’s why I’m asking you. You know how to stand up and fight. You knew how to kill that wolf.” He scratched his beard. “Yeah, well. Funny thing, that whole business. I didn’t strike it that hard, you know? I just got lucky. That big old wolf must have been tired or sick or something, because I barely grazed it. It died a few seconds after I struck it.” I blinked. “I thought you chopped its head off.” 38 “That was after he died. Didn’t want to take any chances with a wolf that big. But – well, anyway. Fighting’s not the answer. Not for a young girl like you.” “So I just have to get beat up?” He pressed his lips tight, then sighed heavily at the ground. He crouched beside me, his voice dropping to a low whisper. “All right, come here. Look. The thing about any fight is, not so much getting in your licks at the other guy, as making sure he doesn’t get anything on you.” I squinted. “Huh?” “I mean, don’t tire yourself out. If he swings at you with his right, you step aside and let him miss. When he swings again, you step back or to the side again. Sooner or later, he’ll tire himself out trying to hit you.” “And then you flatten him,” I said, excited. He half-smiled. “Well, yeah. But the same thing. Don’t tire yourself out. Look, you’re a girl. Boys are gonna be stronger than you most of the time, right? So don’t just use your fists.” He leaned toward the corner of the stable and listened to make sure the others were still talking. Then he crouched and spoke even softer. “Grab a stick. Or a brick. Or a rock. Or anything you can use to lay him flat.” My stomach churned at the thought of a brick smashing into Jacque Denue’s face. “I don’t want to kill him.” “Then don’t hit him where you’ll kill him. Just hit him hard enough in the knee or the gut that he won’t think of bothering you again. All right?” 39 I nodded, satisfied. “All right.” “And, uh – .” He glanced back to the side again. “Don’t tell your father we had this talk. Think it’s better that way.” I smiled. “Me, too.” He nodded, pressing his hands on his knees to rise. Then he bent back down. “Listen, Helena. If you ever run into trouble – real trouble – and I’m not around, I want you to look up a friend of mine in the village. Name’s Gerard Touraine. He’ll look after you.” I nodded. “Gerard Touraine. All right.” He glanced back at the corner of the stable. We heard Papa still talking with the others. “All right, let me show you how to look after yourself.” He stood a little, his hands on his knees as he bent over me. He made a fist. “If someone comes at you like this, see, you step sideways out of the way. That’s it. Hey, even hobbling around, it’s easier to move without a dress, ain’t it? Now while he’s swinging hard and hitting air, he’s off-balance. See that? See how I’m ready to fall forward? So you knuckle both your fists together and swing hard on his back to carry him the rest of the way. He’ll plant his face in the mud. Or he’ll double over and you can bring your knee up hard to his jaw. Got me? But you gotta know how to keep from getting hit first, so you can use his own strength against him. Then you just knock him over or punch him in his ribs, hard. That’ll take the wind out of him. Strike hard and fast. The faster you finish it, the less likely he’ll be to mess with you again.” He glanced up as Papa returned, and straightened to 40 his full height. “– and that’s why you should never fight with boys. That’s what I say. So just stay away from those bullies.” He gave a firm nod. Papa smiled at him. “Duke Laurent and Father Vestille have gone home, now that they know you’re safe. Don’t think they see eye-to-eye on many subjects. Helena, it’ll be dark in a few hours. Are you ready to go home?” I smiled at Francois, feeling a new sense of confidence. “Yes. I’m ready.” Francois Revelier had taught me how to fight. I had new hope. 41 5. It was near dark when we pulled up to our cottage. Only a couple of the sheep lay awake bleating in their pen while the rest slept. Papa had driven Royale faster up the path when the air chilled and the sun dipped toward the horizon. The mud had dried, making the ride faster if not smoother. Mama strode onto the front porch to greet us, her hands twisting around a cloth towel as if it needed to be wrung. She looked pale and her eyes 42 were larger than usual. “Henri. You’re so late. What on earth happened?” “Everything’s all right, Celeste,” he promised. “Had an incident in town. Then we went to see Francois.” She squinted through the darkness to see me. To see my face. Her eyes bulged. “Dear –! Come inside. What happened? Did something –? … Come in here and let me clean you up. Henri, tell me what happened.” I hobbled over the hard ground to Mama. She held me against her as we moved indoors. She led me straight through the front kitchen and off to my room at the back of the house, then helped me lay down on my bed. It felt good to finally rest. Though I dreaded sleep, especially after today. She unlaced my shoes, caked with dry mud, and pulled them off as Papa came in. “Some boys in the village beat her. I took her to Doctor Renoire. He loaned us his son’s clothes for a while, ‘til next time we return to the village.” “Well, you’ll go alone next time. She’s not going back to that village.” Her voice and face grew tight. “I know. Never should’ve agreed to take her in the first place.” “Yes, you should,” I said. “I can’t stay inside forever, Papa. Sooner or later, I’ve got to stand up.” “Hush now,” Mama said, stroking my forehead. “Henri, get a basin of water.” 43 Papa left without a word. “I have to stand up, Mama,” I repeated. “You need to lie down.” “No. I have to stand up to them. I have to fight.” “Hush. Just keep far away from those boys.” I stared at her, marveling at her perfect appearance and poise. Her auburn hair up in a beautiful bun with ringlets dangling about her ears. Her homespun dress – she was an amazing seamstress – rising from her shoulders in shapely curves, its intricate pattern decorating her slim arms and wrists. Her face peaceful and soft, even when flushed with anger. “Mama? Am I a monster?” Her eyes flared. “What on earth would make you think that?” “That’s what those boys said. That’s why they beat me. Because I’m so ugly.” She gaped at me as if I had burned down our cottage. “If that’s why they beat you, it’s those boys who are ugly monsters.” A tear slid around my cheek as I admired her features. “I wish I were pretty like you.” She nearly lunged at me, scooping me into her tight embrace. Papa hurried in with the water basin, but slowed and set it down gently when he saw us hugging. “Helena, you are pretty,” Mama said. “Not to boys, I’m not.” “You don’t need to worry about boys just now. You’re a beautiful girl. And you have a 44 beautiful heart. Someday, when you’re much older, you’ll meet a boy who sees that.” Papa glanced sharply at us. Then he focused on soaking a rag in the water. He didn’t like for me to talk about boys at all, even with Mama. “The boys in town think I’m a monster. Except for Pierre.” Mama trembled against me. “Well, he’s a nice boy, at least. You can forget about the others. Now let’s get you cleaned up.” Papa slid the basin closer and Mama helped me remove the boy’s tunic and trousers. She cleaned every bruise and cut, put fresh bandages over a few of them, then dried me off and helped me dress in my nightgown. “Say your prayers,” she said. I knelt carefully beside my bed as they stood watch. My back and side and one knee still ached horribly. I made the sign of the cross over myself and folded my blistered hands. “Dear Lord, please bless and secure our home. Protect us and lead us. Bless our province. Bless Francois and Father Vestille and Duke Laurent, and help the King see that we need help. Heal me and help me sleep through the night. Amen.” I rose slowly, pulled back the covers and climbed into bed. Papa hung his head and tightened his fists as Mama kissed my forehead. “I love you, Helena,” she said, her voice strained. “Sweet dreams.” They stepped out and shut the door, encasing me in blackness. 45 Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares. I wandered through the flowery meadow outside our home and on into the dark canopy of the woods. My little basket swung at my side. I smiled at the red hooded cloak surrounding me, the one Grand’Mere had made, warding off the early morning chill. My cheeks were rosy and free of scars. I listened close in the darkness of the pine trees, shuddering. Within the whistling wind, I could hear its voice. Where are you going, little girl? I started to run. Through the woods, past shrubs and towering trees and scurrying animals. The forest grew denser, until I felt it might close in on me. I scoured every direction for the source of the growling voice but saw nothing. So nice to see you again, little girl. My heart pounded. I ran faster. I stumbled, but rose to my feet and raced on. The voice grew louder. I can see you, little Helena. I’m coming after you … I emerged from the woods, from the heavy strangle of trees, into the broad meadow outside Grand’Mere Marie’s cottage. I had to warn her. I ran to her door and pounded on it, stealing glances over my shoulder. The woods remained still and quiet, but the voice persisted from somewhere. Helena. I’m coming for you … 46 I heard snoring. At the neighboring cottage, the window shutter hung open. I could see Francois’ large frame, asleep on his cot, his giant belly rising and falling. Ah, there you are, Helena. I spun around. In a stream of fog at the edge of the dark forest, the black wolf stood tall, its blue-gray eyes shining brightly. I twisted the doorknob and ran inside. I slammed the door shut with both hands, then swung the bolt down to lock it. I turned to find Grand’Mere. There on her bed, something shuffled in the sheets. The black wolf had already gotten inside somehow, circling among Grand’Mere’s nightgown and cap, now soaked in blood. I gasped and fell against the door. The beast fixed its ghostly eyes on me. Its voice rasped low and cruel. “Come in, little girl. Come see your Grand’Mere.” The same wolf that had padded close to me in the woods, keeping its distance but calling out until I answered. Until I told it I was going to my Grand’Mere’s house, and to leave me alone. Instead, it had raced ahead to devour her. The wolf jumped down from the bloody bed and padded across the cherrywood floor toward me. It stood – stood – on its hind legs, grinning. I hurled my basket at its face. It scraped the beast’s nose and bounced off. The wolf arched its eyebrows, its blue-gray eyes widening. It lifted its paw, extending sharp claws, then swiped at me as I screamed. 47 Everything fell black. My skin felt clammy, my nightgown drenched with sweat. I sat straight up in bed, feeling the soreness in my back as I stared into the pitch darkness. Something stomped hard across the floorboards. Then a faint light peeked beneath my door. Mama came in. Papa followed her, bearing a lantern. Mama rushed to my side and cradled me. “Helena, you’re all right. It’s just a bad dream.” I clung to her, feeling numb. I stared at Papa’s lantern, the only source of light. “It spoke again,” I said. “Hush, Helena,” she told me. “It was just a bad dream. Wolves can’t speak.” I let her rock me back and forth, back and forth. They never believed me, any more than Father Vestille or Francois had when they brought me to Doctor Renoire. They assumed I was hysterical and babbling in my delirium. I closed my eyes to shut out the nightmare. But my mind saw the wolf’s leering grin. Heard its guttural voice. “Where’s my cloak?” I asked. They said nothing. I opened my eyes. Papa straightened, his posture rigid. “It’s put away.” “Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. It’s mine.” In the pale light of his high lantern, Papa’s dark moustache formed a thick frown. “Your burlap cloak will keep you warm enough. And it won’t attract attention.” 48 A wolf howled in the distance. My body tensed in a spasm as Mama tightened her hold. Papa rushed to the shuttered window. He stood there, his back to me. For a moment, I thought he would throw open the shutter, to see if the wolf was lurking right outside. I expected him to leap through the window in one bound, race into the forest, find the wolf, and strangle it with his bare hands. He only stood there, listening. The wolf’s howls rose, rattling my nerves as though it lived inside me. Papa stared at the closed shutter. “You can sleep in our bed again tonight,” he said. 49 6. The sun broke through the clouds to shine down on our lost sheep. Drawn to the blooming purple flowers, it had wandered down the slope, near the cliff’s edge. “There she is!” Papa tugged on Royale’s reins as he held up a hand to the rest of us. Our border collie, Valiant, barked beneath him. Pierre pulled his horse, Diamond, to a jarring halt. His arm snaked around my back to keep me from falling off, pressing me closer against him. His father, Monsieur Leóne, followed 50 suit and stopped Ruby, who shifted awkwardly beneath his weight. The four of us paused at the crest of the hill, at the edge of the forest. I clung to Pierre’s warm back, the best protection against the biting cold. The broad grassland below was bathed in sunshine, lush and green and deadly. We saw where our sheep had broken through some taller grass and nibbled its way near the cliff. Beyond its rim, the distant mountains stood guard in a hazy mist. I could barely make out the well-girded wooden bridge that connected them, as it disappeared in the fog halfway across. “Careful now,” Papa said. “Don’t scare it.” He started down first, leading Royale step by step, careful not to stumble. Valiant padded obediently beside him. I peered around Pierre at a huge hole in the ground, that looked as though some giant had taken a bite out of the hill. I hoped Papa and Valiant wouldn’t fall into it. I pressed myself closer, giving Pierre a gentle hug. “Thank you for holding on to me,” I said. “No problem, Red,” he whispered back. I smiled. “You know I can’t wear my cloak anymore, Pierre.” I didn’t count the burlap shawl as a cloak, as I pulled it closer about my shoulders. I had just turned eight years old, but I still wasn’t allowed to wear anything too bright outside. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll always be ‘Red’ to me.” Pierre was the only one who still called me ‘Red’. I had worn that scarlet hooded cloak 51 everywhere, even indoors, for two straight years. I had swept into every room, beaming as the cape fanned out behind me. Wrapped inside it, I always felt as if nothing could harm me. No degree of cold, no sad news, no fears. I felt the same way whenever Pierre called me ‘Red’. Papa and Valiant drew closer and closer to the sheep. It seemed to take forever. I wanted to jump down from Diamond’s back, rush down the hill and scoop it up myself. But, as Papa often reminded me, I needed to learn patience. My foot shook back and forth against Diamond’s flank with anticipation. Diamond whinnied, annoyed. “Helena, stop!” Pierre whispered. “Sorry.” The sheep jerked its head up at the sound. Papa stopped Royale and waited, neither he nor Valiant moving. The sheep finally returned to its grazing. Papa turned slowly to look up the hill at us. I swallowed, feeling my cheeks burn. He continued down, one hoof at a time, as the sheep nibbled at the grassy slope. I stared again at the giant hole. “What’s that?” I whispered. Pierre leaned back to my ear. “Probably left over from the war, when everyone started invading. People had to find all sorts of places to hide away. This must be one somebody dug out.” I pressed against his back, pulling him tight. “Mama told me we had to hide when I was a baby. She wouldn’t tell me anything else about it, though. But I remember looking up and seeing a wide door open above me. There was a big ramp 52 with steps leading out into the sun. I think I was only three years old.” Diamond shuffled his feet and whinnied again. Papa turned sharply and looked right at me. I shrank back behind Pierre. Papa continued down the slope and pulled Royale to a stop, about fifteen feet from the sheep. He clicked his tongue at Valiant, who moved around the animal to stand between it and the cliff’s edge. He barked and the sheep jolted upright, bleating. Valiant barked louder, moving toward it. The sheep shuffled toward Papa, who led Royale behind the sheep to guide it up the hill. We would have no trouble leading it home now. “Come on down,” he called to us. “Let’s take a rest.” He climbed down and took some jerky from his saddle pouch. We descended slowly with Monsieur Leóne and the horses. “What’s that bridge near the mountains?” I asked. “Leads out of the province,” Pierre said. “Across the gorge, then through the mountains. Eventually, if you keep going, you get to the royal palace in Versailles.” “That would be exciting, to see the palace.” Pierre shrugged. “I hear the King’s corrupt.” “Who says that?” “My father. He says the King won’t talk to Duke Laurent at all. We get no support from the court. The Duke keeps asking them to send soldiers here, but the King won’t even answer his letters.” 53 “I heard Papa talking about that with the Duke in the Fall, when he told Francois about the banquet. I wish you could come. We’ve been waiting for it all winter.” He shrugged again. “Only rich people there, besides you and your parents. Heard they invited a couple of people Francois knows, but it’s mostly the Duke’s friends. Think he’s trying to impress everyone with a show.” “You think so?” I asked, concerned. “It’s what royal people do. They don’t necessarily do anything to help, just make it look like they’re doing something. I think the party’s more for the Duke to look good than to honor Francois.” I considered that, then waved it off. “That may be. But the Duke’s not like other royal people.” “True,” Pierre said. “If everyone at the court were like him, we’d probably have those soldiers by now.” “Why do we need soldiers?” He stopped Diamond and turned in his seat, narrowing his eyes at me. They were brown and beautiful beneath his shaggy dirt-blond hair. He could have told me anything right then and I would have sat on his horse and listened for hours. “Because of the wolf,” he said. A lump gathered in my throat. Riding with Pierre through the mountains and rolling hills after being penned up at our cottage these last two months, I had forgotten about the wolf today. “Oh,” I said. 54 “You and your Grand’Mere weren’t the only ones attacked, Red. Other people have been killed over the years. And people are still being killed. But no one’s seen this other wolf in time to stop it. We need soldiers to find it and kill it, so it’ll be safe again.” Safe again. The idea sounded so strange to me. I couldn’t imagine any number of soldiers making me feel safe in La Rue Sauvage. “Do you miss your mother?” I asked. I wanted to change the subject. It was easier to talk about Pierre’s grief than my own. He swiped at his thick hair, showing his forehead for an instant. “Sure. ‘Course I do.” He bit his lip. “But we’ve been pretty busy. Papa’s teaching me all there is to know about smelting and making tools and pots. He tells me I’ve got the skill for it, as much as he did when he was my age. Thinks I’ll make a great blacksmith some day.” Diamond shifted to one side as Pierre maneuvered him past some holes in the side of the hill. I leaned forward and clung tighter to Pierre. “I think so, too,” I told him. “Easy there,” Monsieur Leóne called to both of us, his belly shifting from side to side as he led Ruby down the foothill. “It’s steep. Don’t want to tumble off the edge.” “Yes, Papa,” Pierre said. Below him, Papa stood chewing his jerky. “Everyone all right? Frayne, thanks for spotting her.” Valiant barked as if in agreement. Papa gave him a biscuit from his pouch. 55 “Thought it looked like yours,” Monsieur Leóne said, struggling to climb down. “Next moment, it was gone. Can’t believe it wandered this far so quickly.” He swiped at thin strands of hair falling over his face, the same way Pierre often did. “Just glad I could do something to help.” Papa squatted and brushed some brambles off the sheep’s wool. “Looks like it fell down a hill or two. Good thing it found plenty of grass to nibble on here, before it rolled into the ravine. Sit down. We’ll head back in a minute.” We sat in the grass, chewing on jerky and biscuits and enjoying the fresh air and billowing clouds. I spotted a distant path around the left side of the mountain, far ahead. I stood and walked toward it as Valiant scampered after me, yapping. Papa stood and almost choked on his biscuit. “Helena! Come back from the cliff!” “I’m not near the edge. Look, there’s a road down here.” Someone had built a path around the side of the mountain. It sloped down and gradually worked its way back up to join the broad dirt path leading to the bridge and out of the province. “I said, come back,” Papa repeated. I stuck my fists on my hips. “Papa, I can take care of myself. Don’t you remember I’m eight now?” “You’ve been eight for a week,” he said. He finished chewing and climbed back onto Royale. “And we’ve stayed long enough already. Let’s head home before it gets dark.” 56 My heart sank. I knelt to scratch Valiant behind the ears. “Papa, it’s a beautiful day. Can’t we ride a little farther?” “I let you come along because you wanted to help and you wanted to see Pierre, and I figured it’s just as well to know where you are. We’ve had a nice rest, but it’s time to get back home. Come along.” He nudged Royale’s flanks and started a quick trot up the hill. Monsieur Leóne followed suit with Ruby. “Sorry, Red,” Pierre said. “It’s so pretty here.” I stared out at the endless mountain range beyond the bridge, shrouded in fog and mystery. I didn’t mind the moist chill on my shoulders, if it meant being free to roam outside, beyond our meadow, even for a little while. I found myself staring through the haze at the bridge leading out of La Rue Sauvage. It lay just beyond the wide green plateau that stretched away on both sides and ended in two points, resembling a large sleeping crocodile. Pierre mounted Diamond and bent to offer his hand. I took it and climbed up behind him. We turned slowly from the inviting scene. Pierre took his time leaving, knowing how much I wanted to stay. He was giving me every second he could. “Come on, Pierre,” Papa called from the crest of the hill. “I thought you said that horse was fast.” There was humor in his voice. I couldn’t remember the last time he sounded happy. “The fastest,” Pierre called back. “Well, prove it! We need to get the sheep settled so we can make it to the banquet.” 57 “Hey, look at that,” Pierre said, inspired. “What?” “There’s a hole down on this end, too.” I looked where he was pointing as Valiant started barking and growling at it. Behind a boulder at our far right, close to the edge, another enormous hole had been dug through the side of the hill, nearly big enough to fit a wagon. “It’s a tunnel.” “Yeah. Leading straight up to the top.” I smiled. “You’re so smart, Pierre.” “Hang on.” He spurred Diamond toward the hole. Diamond snorted and kicked up dirt as Valiant barked and chased after us. I clung tighter to Pierre while Papa and Monsieur Leóne gaped, before breaking into a gallop after us. It must have looked like we were headed over the cliff. Valiant stopped short near the dark passage and fell back, to race up the hill instead. We curved around the boulder and Papa’s frantic image vanished as we descended into the tunnel’s black mouth. The swallowing darkness and cold frightened me for a moment, but I pressed close against Pierre. My eyes adjusted quickly, as light bled in from the other end of the tunnel and from small holes dug into the earth above us. They would be invisible on the surface, but here below they gave extra light and air. Pierre was right about men hollowing out this tunnel for refuge during the war. Diamond’s hooves clomped over several logs that had been buried in the ground to create a partial stairway. 58 Something stirred in the darkness up ahead. A large animal had hunched over something in the center of the tunnel and now raised its head, its eyes flashing on us. Its blue-gray eyes. The wolf growled from somewhere deep in its belly as we rushed past it, its breath forming a white shroud. “Hurry!” I cried. Pierre leaned forward in the saddle, urging Diamond up the dark slope. Behind us, the black wolf watched us go. I heard his mouth smacking on something he was eating. Something he must have dragged down here to finish off. Then he started after us. “Go, Pierre! Faster!” Pierre pushed Diamond harder and we lunged forward. The enormous wolf loped after us in greater strides. It would sink its teeth into us in seconds. “GO!” Light filled the end of the tunnel as it formed a steeper angle, where extra logs had been laid. I felt a touch of the sun’s warmth as we neared the opening. The wolf slowed and skidded to a halt, letting us flee. We burst out of the upper end, my heart pounding as I gasped for breath. “Helena!” Papa thundered, his angry voice bringing a strange sense of calm. “What did you think you were doing?’ Valiant barked and growled at the hole behind us. 59 Monsieur Leóne trotted up to us, his eyes wide beneath his wild, unkempt hair. “Do you realize what might have happened? Who knows what might be in there?” I had never seen him so agitated. Pierre was flustered. “Papa, there was something! There was – !” “Let’s go home!” I interrupted. “We’re really sorry, Papa. Monsieur Leóne. We won’t do it again. Let’s just – Let’s just hurry home so we can get to the banquet.” “But –!” Pierre burst. “Pierre, we made a mistake. We shouldn’t have gone in there. Let’s just go home, all right? Let’s just go home.” He breathed deeply in and out, staring at me in fright. “Helena. What happened?” Papa asked. “We – We almost tripped. On a tree root. Almost fell over. We got scared. That’s all. Let’s all just hurry home and forget about it, all right? Please?” Pierre looked from me to Papa and Monsieur Leóne. He slowed his frantic breathing as Valiant watched the tunnel with a murmuring growl. He stared at me again, then back at the quiet hole. “All right. Let’s forget about it. For now.” “Just don’t try anything so foolish again,” Papa said. “You might both have been killed.” Pierre led Diamond away. I squinted over my shoulder. From deep within the darkness, the blue-gray eyes shone as if studying our every move. 60 7. Papa pulled our wagon up to the front of the tavern. The sign above its hitching post said La Maison de Touraine. We sat for a moment, listening to the raucous men laughing and shouting inside as Papa regarded Mama. She sat rigid, drawing her shawl closer against the evening air, her chin angled up. “I simply can’t understand why it had to be here, of all places. After we waited all winter for the Duke to arrange this. I thought we were supposed to be 61 honoring someone. What’s honorable about surrounding ourselves with a lot of drinking?” They had been silent for most of the ride. At first I thought Papa was still angry at me for riding through the tunnel with Pierre. Then I remembered how Mama felt about alcohol and the place Duke Laurent chose for Francois’ banquet. Besides, I had already promised Papa I would never do it again. And I meant it. I still pictured those blue-gray eyes, shining as they had chased me and Pierre. As they had watched us leave the grassy cliff. Entering that tunnel again would be like jumping into the wolf’s mouth. The tavern’s double doors flew open with a bang and I yelped as two men burst from inside. Their boots clomped across the porch beside the hitching post as they guffawed, one slapping the other on the back. I sighed, quivering. Mama put an arm around me, tugging me close. She frowned at Papa. “Helena doesn’t need to be around men like these. Especially after all that’s happened.” Papa studied me, weighing his decision. “It’s for Francois,” he said. “We won’t stay long.” Mama gave me another strong squeeze, then waited for Papa to hitch up Royale and help her down. He brought me down next. He never swung me in the air anymore, the way Francois did, though I was light enough and my wounds had all mended. Instead, he set me down like I was a porcelain doll. 62 Mama put her hand on my shoulder and we pushed through the large oak double doors. Inside, men roared with laughter and deafening shouts. Some waved their fists in the air as they spoke. I backed into Mama, then clutched her hand with both of mine. This place looked like it could get out of control within seconds. Duke Laurent spotted us from across the room. He strode toward us with open arms, which gave me some assurance. No one could harm us with the Duke standing close by. “Henri! Celeste! So good to see you!” He shook Papa’s hand and kissed Mama’s, then smiled at me. “And how are you today, Helena?” “A bit nervous,” Mama answered for me. “I’m afraid this isn’t the most suitable environment for an eight-year old girl.” Papa put a hand on Mama’s shoulder, too late to quiet her. The Duke’s face fell. “I am so sorry,” he said. “I know Francois frequents this place and I know some men who come here. I thought it would be ideal to recognize his actions. I’m afraid I failed to consider what a difficult position it would put you in.” He gave a little laugh. “Perhaps that is why the royal family places so little faith in me.” “It’s all right, Your Grace,” Papa said. “We’re sure you planned this out as best you could.” Mama’s face softened as she met my eyes. I held her hand more loosely now, feeling safer 63 with the Duke standing between us and the crowd. “Yes, we’re here for Francois, after all,” she said. The Duke kissed Mama’s hand again, bowing lower. “The grace of a Queen. Henri is fortunate to have you, and I’m fortunate to have your forgiveness. Now, please, come in and we’ll find Francois. Ah, Simonet! You have not met Henri’s family. Madame Basque, may I present my chief advisor, Siegfried Simonet. Monsieur Simonet, this is Henri’s wife, Madame Celeste Basque, and their daughter, Helena Basque.” The Duke’s advisor loomed over me, tall, thin and frowning, with stringy black hair that rode down his back like the Duke’s. He regarded me with lazy eyes and gave a disinterested nod. I resisted the urge to flinch. Thankfully, Monsieur Simonet turned from me to shake hands with Papa and nod at Mama. He seemed just as unconcerned with them, and quickly turned to Duke Laurent. “How many more guests do you anticipate?” he asked. “Our guest of honor wants to make certain you are providing enough wine and ale.” The Duke laughed. He turned to spread his arms wide as Francois came thundering toward him. “For our hero, all the wine and ale he wants!” “That’sss what I like to hearrr!” Francois said, stumbling a little as he approached. ‘Most grateful for your hossspitality, Your Highnesss.” I prepared to run toward him, to let him swing me through the air. But Mama’s hand pressed on my shoulder and held me back. 64 Papa stepped forward. “Francois. Good to see you.” “Heyyy,” Francois said, blinking at Papa as if he didn’t recognize him. “Henri. And Celeste.” He turned to me and crouched, pressing his hands over his knees. One fist held a dark half-empty bottle. “And there’s little Helena. How’rrre you, little Mademoissselle?” “Fine,” I said. “Are you all right, Francois?” He waved me off and stood, like an old woman trying to rise from her rocking chair. “‘Courssse. ‘Course I am. Just enjoying this wonderful party the Duke’s giving me, that’s all. After your birthday, it’s jussst been onne party after anothhher.” The Duke winked at me. “He’s fine, Helena.” He smiled at Simonet. “I don’t suppose you’ll indulge yourself with any wine tonight, Simonet?” Simonet maintained his frown. “I prefer to keep myself alert.” Duke Laurent leaned toward Papa. “Simonet is extremely self-disciplined. He’s the closest thing I have to a priest.” I looked about, hopeful to see our actual priest. “Is Father Vestille here?” “I invited him,” Duke Laurent said. “But he declined.” Francois barked out a laugh. “He’s afraid of the beer!” Papa leaned close to the Duke as Francois continued to laugh louder. “He’s visiting one of the 65 other provinces. Dijon. There’s a large church there –.” “Ah, of course,” the Duke said. “Can’t expect him to remain satisfied with a tiny province like La Rue Sauvage forever. I wish him success.” Papa knit his brow. “He’s not seeking a better position. Just visiting.” “Oh, he has friends there?” “Yes. Well – friends he’s made there. On previous visits.” “Ah. I see,” the Duke said, smiling. I looked from one face to the other, trying to understand. “What are you saying, Monsieur Laurent?” “Nothing at all, Helena. For any man, even a priest, there comes a time to think about the future. I came here from Versailles myself and I’m quite proud of our accomplishments. But I wouldn’t blame anyone for seeking opportunity in a larger province. Somewhere more comfortable or safe. A man like Father Vestille could become very influential if he found the right church.” I felt as if he had ripped my heart out and left a gaping hole in my chest. “You think he wants to leave?” He shrugged. “I couldn’t tell you what he’s planning. But I find it hard to imagine him remaining content with a small church when he could do so much more, and be well-rewarded for his service. And there are certainly safer places to preach than La Rue Sauvage.” Mama bowed her head and spoke in the firm voice she usually reserved for scolding me. 66 “We’ve known Father Abier Vestille for years. We invited him here from Burgundy, after we settled. He’s not cowardly or opportunistic and never has been. He only wants to serve others.” “I certainly understand that,” the Duke said. “But – well, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure if you know him that well, you know the true purpose of his trip to Dijon.” Papa shifted his foot as Mama fell silent. “He didn’t say. Exactly.” The Duke looked from Papa to Mama and back again, still offering a friendly smile. He cleared his throat, sounding uncomfortable. “No matter, Henri. Whatever the reason, I’m certain his trips take precedence. Come. Enjoy the party. We have a wonderful feast.” He strode toward a table filled with rich food and we moved to follow him, though I began to drag my feet. Father Vestille had always been like part of our family. Before last year, he visited our house every Sunday after Mass. We ate lamb or stew and talked about the Scripture lessons and the events in the village and the new dress Mama was making. He sat me on his lap to tell him everything the sheep and Valiant were doing, everything I saw in the field that day, every cloud and flower and insect. Before last year, that is. Before the wolf. “Hey, Helennna,” Francois said, bending down to take my arm. “Hey, let me introduce you to a friennnd of mine.” He waved a heavy hand 67 toward the bar, as though he were trying to fish something out of the air. Mama started toward me, but Papa held her back with an arm around her shoulder. “She’ll be all right. It’s their party. We’re safe in here, at least.” Mama relented and they stepped away with the Duke. A man wearing an apron stepped out from behind the bar and marched toward us. He had strong arms and a broad, crooked smile beneath a mop of reddish-brown hair. Francois waved his arm toward the man and thumped him in the chest. “This’s my bessst friend in all of France. Gerard Touraine. He ownsss the place.” “He’s the one you told me about, right?” I asked. Monsieur Touraine put his hands on his knees and bent toward me. “So you’re the little girl my overbearing friend here rescued. May I say, Mademoiselle, how pleased I am that he did.” I felt myself blush. “Thank you, Monsieur.” “She’s not ssso little anymore,” Francois said with a silly smile. “She just turned eight.” Monsieur Touraine’s eyebrows rose. “Eight? I can tell.” “Thank you,” I beamed. “Like I said,” Francois continued. “If you ever need anything, if you ever need real help, Gerard’sss your man. He’ll take care of you, whateverrr you need. I promissse.” 68 Monsieur Touraine slid a sideways glance at Francois, then smiled back at me. “Well, for now, how about this?” He reached into the front pocket of his apron and pulled out a peppermint stick. “My favorite!” I gasped. “Is it?” Monsieur Touraine asked, grinning at Francois. “Isn’t that a coincidence? I had no idea.” “See what I mean? Anything you need, jussst come to Gerard. He’ll alwaysss take care of you.” Monsieur Touraine put a hand on Francois’s shoulder. “Such as taking care of seeing you home tonight, friend.” Francois sputtered and waved him off. “The Duke’sss servants’re seeing me home tonight. You hearrr that? The Duke’s!” “A hero’s wages,” Monsieur Touraine laughed. He bent to kiss my hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle.” He turned and moved back to the bar, where he poured a drink for one of the men sitting there. “He’s nice,” I said. “The nicccest.” “I’m glad everyone knows you’re a hero now.” “Awww.” Francois blinked, his face turning serious. “You know what a – You know what a hero is, Helena? A hero doesn’t have to be big or strong or sssmart. He just has to stand up to do what’sss got to be done. People might not underssstand what you’re doin’ or why you’re 69 doin’ it. But it’s still got to be done, whether they understand it or not. A hero’s just sssomebody who stands up to do it when nobody else will. That’sss all. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped. All I did was stand up.” I smiled. “Well, you’re my hero.” He grinned at me. “Yeah? Well, you’re mine!” He lifted his bottle toward me. “Cheersss, Mademoiselle.” I clinked my peppermint stick against it. “Cheers, Monsieur.” He took a deep swig from his ale while I sucked on my candy. 70 8. “That was the best party last night,” I beamed, no longer focusing on the needle and thread in my hands. Mama wanted me to practice sewing straight lines on an old patch, but I was too excited. She sat beside me at our dining table, creating a new dress. “It was interesting,” she said, her voice subdued as she stared at the linen and lace spread over her lap. I glanced at my needle to keep from pricking myself. “I met Monsieur Touraine. He 71 owns the tavern and he’s Francois’ best friend. He gave me three peppermints. And we ate peanuts and pretzels and drank ginger beer, and Francois showed me how to blow bubbles in it.” Mama gave a small smile. “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.” I fixed my attention on the needle and thread. “Once I learn how to sew this patch, I can start sewing dresses. And then you can teach me how to sew clothes for you and Papa.” “That’s right, dear. But keep working on that patch first. Careful you don’t get another snarl.” “I’m gonna be a great seamstress, just like you and Grand’Mere Marie.” Her gaze dropped into her lap. “… She made some beautiful things.” I squinted at the needle and thread, still struggling to make a good backstitch. I stopped again. “When I’m older, maybe I can serve at a fancy party. Like the one last night. Except with more ladies. I could make dresses for everyone.” “That would be nice,” Mama said. “Or someone might invite you.” I shook my head. “No. But no one needs to invite me. I just want to make something beautiful for someone to wear. Something bright red. If I can’t have a pretty face, I can still make pretty dresses like you.” Mama stared at the material in her lap, saying nothing. I frowned. “Too bad Father Vestille couldn’t come.” 72 “Yes. We missed seeing him.” I pretended to study my needle. “Mama? Do you think what Monsieur Laurent said is true? Do you think Father Vestille wants to leave?” Her face screwed up. “Not a word. With all respect, our Duke doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” “How do you know for sure? What if Father Vestille wants to move somewhere else, like back to Burgundy?” She put down her sewing. “Father Vestille came here when we learned there had been no priest in La Rue Sauvage for eight years. He’s been here ever since. He has no intention of leaving.” “But that was before.” Her eyebrows rose. “Before what?” I stiffened. “Before the wolf.” She leaned forward. “You imagine he’s running away?” I shrugged. “We never see him anymore. He’s always traveling, always visiting other people. Ever since last year.” She lowered her chin. “Listen to me, Helena. Your father and I trust Father Vestille with our lives. He would not leave without telling us first, if he ever actually considered leaving. And he won’t abandon us.” “But how can you know for certain? What if he’s changed? He’s not like Francois or Duke Laurent. He’s just an ordinary man. Maybe he’s worried there’s another wolf out there.” Mama sighed. “Helena. Father Vestille has always helped us whenever we needed it. He 73 always will. I don’t know what his trips involve. He never wants to discuss it. But I trust him. You don’t have to know all of a person’s activities to know you can depend on them. And you don’t have to be strong or influential to be brave.” I hoped she was right. That Father Vestille would never leave us. But I couldn’t stop wondering. “All right. If you’re certain.” She smiled into her lap, returning to her sewing. “There are many things I’m not certain about,” she said. “But I’m certain of Father Vestille.” I didn’t dare argue with her further. I heard Papa’s boots clomp onto the porch, then stop. We both turned. The front door creaked open, letting in the early morning chill. Papa entered as though he had seen a ghost. “Papa, what’s wrong?” I asked. We had left the banquet early last night and made it home well before nightfall, but Mama and Papa had let me sleep as late as I wanted. My head was still filled with memories of the roast duck and caviar and raspberry tarts, and meeting Monsieur Touraine and the Duke’s friends. What could possibly have spoiled Papa’s mood after such a thrilling party? “Celeste. I need – I need to speak with you.” “Papa?” His eyes warned me to keep still. “Stay inside.” Mama dropped her sewing and swept toward the front door. She hurried outside and Papa shut the door behind her. 74 I stayed inside as I was told and continued working on the practice patch, determined to sew a straight line. My thread snarled into another knot and I grumbled. How could I concentrate when Papa was on the front stoop sharing some dreadful secret? But I kept to my place. I tried to loosen the tiny knot and start over with my line. I didn’t even creep closer to listen. Until Mama wailed. I ran to the door and threw it open. Mama covered her face with both hands, sobbing. Papa held her by the shoulders. She looked as though she might crumple to the ground if he let go. “What happened? What is it?” “Back inside!” Papa barked. I stepped away from his glare of rage. I slammed the door and marched back to the table. I snatched up my patch, with its needle and tangled thread, and slapped it down on the tabletop. Stupid patch! Why couldn’t I at least make something that wasn’t ugly? They were keeping something from me. Something terrible. Like they kept everything else. I couldn’t venture outside. I couldn’t be left alone. I couldn’t go anywhere, even with them, if it got too late in the day. They meant to keep me cooped up in our cottage forever. I slumped back into my chair. I was still seething when the door opened, an inch at a time. Papa trudged in with a wary look, like he was afraid of me. Or of something else. “Helena …” 75 He moved like a sleepwalker to the chair beside me. Mama followed him like a dutiful soldier, head down. Her face red, her eyes squinting and sore. “Helena,” Papa started again. “Something happened to Francois.” “What?” I glanced from one solemn face to the other. “Is Crimson all right?” Papa seemed to stare through me at someone else or someplace else. “I believe so. But Lightning is gone.” “Gone where?” Mama turned aside. The sunlight from the windows glinted off the tears on her cheeks. “Henri, perhaps we should talk about this another time …” “No, Celeste. She’s going to hear it from someone over the next few days. It’s just as well that she hear it from us.” Mama fixed her gaze on me and stiffened. I felt as though they were waiting for something to happen to me. “What’s wrong? Tell me.” Papa swiped his large hands over his face. As if trying to wipe something away. “Helena. … Francois is dead. So is his mare.” I stared at Papa, trying to understand. Stared at his mouth that had just spoken those words. Saw him speak them again, in my mind. He said Francois was dead, just like Grand’Mere Marie was dead. Just like Pierre’s mother. Dead. “… How come?” My throat felt strangled. 76 Papa licked his lips. Glanced from side to side. Sat back a little in his chair. “Some wolves attacked him. In his house.” My mind saw the blue-gray eyes again, shining out of the black tunnel. Shining out of the dark forest. Watching me. Waiting. I breathed deeper. Felt my heart beat faster. “How did they get inside?” Papa scratched at his chin. “His door – somehow came off its hinges. And they all went in.” My temples throbbed, my lip quivering. “How many?” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Looked like four of them, at the least.” “How do you know?” “Henri,” Mama interrupted. “She’s going to hear it,” he repeated. Mama bit her lip. Papa swallowed. He stared straight into my eyes. “What happened to Francois – was very sad. When they found him, he was – he was not in one piece. They tore him asunder. Lieutenant-General Sharrad figures it took at least four of them to do it.” My insides felt hollow as a dead log. “And the mare?” “Henri …” Papa’s eyes continued to burrow into me. “She was the same. All over the stable. They found the foal tied up in its stall. Seemed to be struggling to get out.” “We’ve got to go get him!” I shrieked. 77 Papa paled. “We can’t care for an extra horse, Helena. He needs to go someplace where he can –.” “We’ve got to get him, Papa! We’ve got to bring him home before the wolves come back!” Mama took a step forward. “Francois may have relatives nearby, dear. They might want the foal for –.” “Crimson is mine! Francois promised him to me.” Papa’s eyebrows knit together. “He didn’t so much as promise to –.” “He promised I could ride him. How can I ride him if someone takes him away? How can I take care of him? The wolves came back for Francois. They’ll come for Crimson next.” They exchanged puzzled looks. Mama bent over me. “Darling, what do you mean, ‘the wolves came back’?” “Because Francois saved me. Because he killed one of them, and they wanted revenge.” Papa lowered his head and met my eyes. “Helena. Wolves don’t take revenge.” My eyes narrowed back at his. “They’re not wolves.” They gaped at me as I remembered the wolf looming over me on its hind legs, grinning with its sharp fangs. Those same eyes would always be there, shining in my memory and my nightmares. Mocking me. Threatening me. Terrifying me. “Where’s my cloak?” Their eyes bulged. 78 Mama wrung her hands. “Dear. Why do you ask?” “I want it. Where is it?” “It’s put away,” Papa said, straightening in his chair. “It’s mine. Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. Give it to me.” Mama lowered her chin. “Helena, that is no way to speak to your father.” “Where’s my cloak?” I demanded. I no longer cared what they would do to me for being so brash. Papa’s moustache formed a dark frown. “Helena. You’re never to wear that cloak again.” I turned from them and marched through the cottage. I knocked over books and cleared away half-sewn dresses from Mama’s table. Papa stood. “Calm yourself this instant, young lady.” I rummaged through baskets and pots and wooden boxes. “Where is it? I want to wear it. It’s mine! I want to wear it right now!” “Helena, stop,” Mama begged. I ran to their room at the rear of the cottage. I opened boxes of their personal items, boxes I was never allowed to touch. “It’s my cloak!” “Stop it, Helena,” Papa growled. “Stop now!” I kept digging, past Mama’s leather-bound journal and her flasks of perfume. Past Papa’s snuff pouches and spare cartridges and his old crossbow from the war. “Helena!” 79 Papa’s massive fist closed around my wrist and yanked me away. He held me against his chest as I thrashed about. I didn’t care if he dragged me outside and flogged me with a switch for acting like a spoiled brat. What did it matter if he beat me? What did anything matter anymore? He held me. Held me tight and refused to let me go. I wriggled against him, pounding my small fists on his chest. I shut my eyes, ground my teeth, beat my head against him. Then I collapsed and bawled into his tunic. “I want my cloak,” I cried, gushing tears. “I want to wear my red cloak.” Papa’s breath rustled in and out of his lungs like a bear, as Mama’s gentle hands stroked my hair. “I’ll ask about the horse,” Papa said at last. “We can build another stall for the stable.” 80 9. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over the body of Francois Revelier. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as if he could see the body beneath the heavy lid. “I did not know 81 Francois Revelier well,” he said. “I wish I did. What I do know is that he was a brave man. An honorable man. A man whom others could depend on. As a foreman in his woodcutting business. As a neighbor. And as a friend. Francois Revelier risked his life in an attempt to save his own neighbor, Marie Justine. He heard her cries too late to rescue her, but because of his bravery, his compassion, and his willingness to act, he rescued her granddaughter, Helena Basque, who sits here among us today.” He extended an open hand toward me. Several heads turned. Staring at me and my scars. “Because of his swift and courageous action, the Basque family – and all of us as well – were spared sorrow upon sorrow. They lost a beloved mother that day, a kind woman I knew back in Burgundy, who moved here to be with her daughter and their family.” Mama withdrew a lace handkerchief, one she had embroidered herself, and wiped at her eyes, sniffing. “Francois was a good neighbor to her, to the very end,” Father Vestille continued. “If he could have given his life for hers, I believe he would have. Because that is what he was willing to do for Helena.” Mama wrapped her arm around me and squeezed me closer. “It is ironic – and tragic – that he should suffer the same fate as Marie Justine, a year after destroying the wolf that claimed her life.” Father Vestille paused, as though thinking of something 82 else. Something important. Then he went on. “We can’t fully understand these events, any more than we can understand any such tragedy. But I hope we can all agree on one thing. Whether we knew Francois as a close friend or neighbor, or only heard of his actions in saving young Helena, Francois Revelier was a hero.” I felt as though my guts had been hollowed out. Father Vestille was right. Francois was a hero. But now he was gone. And the wolves were still out there. Who else would stand up to them? The Mass ended. Papa and Monsieur Leóne joined four other men to carry the casket outside. They secured thick ropes under it and lowered it down into a dark rectangular pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Francois there in the dirt forever. “I don’t understand,” Pierre said, suddenly beside me. “Don’t understand what,” I said. My throat felt like dry leaves. “Those wolves. Four of them, maybe more. Just breaking into Francois’ house and attacking him all at once. Like they meant to do it.” I said nothing. I just stared into the dark hole. “Red. That animal we saw, in the tunnel near the bridge. You think that might have been one of them?” “… yes.” “We should have said something. Somebody could’ve stopped it.” 83 I kept staring into the emptiness. Wondering if Pierre was right. But who could we have told? Who would have stopped that wolf, let alone the others? “We gotta be careful,” Pierre went on. “Things like that running around, attacking out of nowhere. I can understand why your parents don’t go out at night.” “Pierre!” I glanced to see Monsieur Leóne beckoning Pierre away. He was speaking to a couple of people I didn’t recognize. “I think Papa’s gathering some new clients. Probably wants me to talk to them, too, to discuss what we can make for them.” He touched my shoulder. “Red. You all right?” I stood stiff and unmoving. Then I nodded, for Pierre’s sake. “Just take care, all right? Those wolves make me nervous.” He hurried away to join his father. “They’re not wolves,” I muttered to no one. At the back of the crowd, I saw Francois’ friend, Monsieur Touraine. He stared sadly at the hole where Francois was laid, but his gaze soon turned blank. I wanted to speak to him, but he turned suddenly and disappeared. “I’ll write to the court again,” Duke Laurent was telling Papa, as he and Mama approached from behind me. “I’ll send Simonet there in person if I have to. Maybe the guards will let him through. Or at least recognize the urgency. They have to see we need soldiers and hunters here 84 to help Lieutenant-General Sharrad’s police kill these things.” “I would appreciate that, Monsieur,” Papa said, sounding numb. Almost as numb as I felt. “Helena. Are you ready to go? Did you get to speak to Father Vestille?” I turned, spotting Father Vestille shaking hands with a couple of guests across the graveyard. “No,” I said, my senses burning. “Not yet.” I strode straight past Papa and Mama and Duke Laurent toward Father Vestille, as he smiled and nodded and showed his concern for the couple talking to him. A couple of people I had never seen before. People he must have visited all of last week, when he disappeared on another of his frequent journeys. Father Vestille lowered his head and spoke quietly with them, a man and a woman in a plain cloak and shawl, which the woman curled about her shoulders as she listened. Seeing me, Father Vestille stopped speaking abruptly. He managed a small smile. “Helena. I want you to meet some friends of mine. This is Monsieur and Madame Serrone, from DeSarte. They came to –.” “Where were you? Where did you go?” I glared up at him, fists clenched. I knew his friends were gaping at me in shock but I didn’t bother looking. I couldn’t care less about them. “I was – visiting some friends.” Father Vestille tugged at his collar with two fingers. “I went to DeSarte, to visit the Serrones here, and some others at their parish.” 85 “That’s why you couldn’t come to Francois’ party?” His Adam’s apple shifted as he swallowed, like a minstrel performer who had forgotten his next line. Did he assume no one would question him? Where he went, what he did? And why? “I wanted to come. I simply – There were other matters I had to attend to, Helena. I’m sorry I couldn’t be with you.” “That doesn’t help anyone now. Does it?” “Helena!” Papa barked. “Mind how you speak to Father Vestille.” He bent down behind me, his harsh breath on my neck, but I didn’t turn. I kept staring into Father Vestille’s pleading eyes. “I’m – sorry, Helena,” Father Vestille said. “I would have come if I could.” “But you couldn’t,” I finished. “Because you had to visit your other friends.” “Helena, that is enough,” Papa growled. As I held Father Vestille’s gaze, his lip quivered. I didn’t care. He should have been sorry. So should Duke Laurent, for not making the King listen and send soldiers. So should Papa and Monsieur Leóne, for doing so little to stop the wolves themselves, and Mama for pretending everything would be all right. Why wouldn’t anyone do something? Francois was the only one willing to act, and now he was gone. “Helena, we’re going home,” Papa said. I didn’t turn to him. I just kept staring into Father Vestille’s sunken eyes. Then I whirled and 86 marched straight toward our wagon. “We don’t have a home.” “Helena!” Papa shouted. His voice broke off as he started to call me again, and I knew Mama’s calming hand was on his arm. I heard her speak gently to Father Vestille. “Please forgive her, Father. She’s angry.” I marched to the wagon, ready to knock aside anyone who stood in my way. Yes, I thought. I’m angry. 87 10. Crimson thundered across the grass, kicking up dirt and fallen leaves as I pulled back on his reins for an abrupt halt. I had grown taller in the last eighteen months, to sit high in the saddle. And I had ridden Crimson so much over the summer that I felt we could read each other’s minds. I barely needed to pull the reins anymore, in any direction, to tell him what I wanted him to do. “Watch this, Mama!” From the front stoop, Mama looked up from her sewing. She cast another glance toward 88 the darkening forest, before returning her attention to me. Papa had been gone all day on his hunt. “Turn!” I called, nudging Crimson’s flanks and tugging the reins to the left. Crimson spun in a dizzying circle. Once, twice, a third time. Then he stomped his front hooves to stop as I pulled back on the reins. “Be careful, dear,” Mama said. “I’m always careful. Watch this!” I nudged Crimson again and we charged at the sheep pen, kicking up dirt as we stopped abruptly at the edge of the gate. The sheep bleated in terror and nearly fell all over themselves. “Did you see that, Mama? They’re hilarious!” “Helena. Don’t scare the sheep.” I frowned. What else was there for me to do? The horses and sheep were all fed and watered. And I had long since given up on learning how to sew. I would never have Mama’s patience. But I had finally discovered something I could master. I could ride. For the first year since Francois was killed, Crimson and I had simply played, running back and forth in the yard. At times, he needed me to calm him, at the sound of a wolf’s howl. Not to calm his fears, but his rage, as he searched about the yard for the source of the sound, ready to charge after it. I coaxed him with pieces of apple or sugar at first, and he soon learned to calm at the sound of my voice. Papa worried that it was too soon to saddle Crimson at the start of the summer, soon after my 89 ninth birthday. But Crimson was strong and seemed eager for it. When he saw the saddle in Papa’s hands, he stomped at the ground, then stayed steady and quiet as Papa fit him with it. As if he wanted me to ride him the way he had seen other visitors ride their horses. We started slowly at first, as Papa led me in a circle around the meadow. Within two weeks, Crimson and I could ride on our own. Which we did every day, for the rest of the summer. “Mama!” I called again as I climbed off the saddle. She looked up. I moved to Crimson’s right side and stuck my left foot in the stirrup. Then I grabbed the saddle’s horn and shouted, “Hah!” Crimson trotted toward the stoop as I hung alongside him, one foot in the stirrup, the other dangling in the air. Mama dropped her sewing. “Helena!” “It’s all right, Mama. I’ve been practicing.” She was still standing with her delicate fists clenched as we trotted up to her, her eyes bulging as I jumped down. “See, Mama? I’m fine.” She said nothing. Just stared at me, her breathing shallow and rapid against the lace bodice of her dress. Crimson snorted and turned toward the forest. I glanced back to see Papa approaching on Royale. A thin animal carcass, tied to the rear of his saddle, scraped a trail through the piles of dead leaves behind him. “Papa!” I called. 90 He waved toward us and continued plodding closer. He always seemed to ride home slowly after a hunt, and this one had obviously been difficult. I turned to Mama. “Can I ride over the hill? Just to the other end of the meadow?” “You know you can’t. Especially near dark.” “Papa goes out.” “Papa hunts.” Royale trudged closer through the scraping leaves. I climbed back onto the saddle and urged Crimson to race toward him. “Papa! I learned a new trick!” “Helena, wait!” He held up a hand, looking alarmed. “It’s all right, I can do it!” I called as we drew near them. “What did you –?” The carcass behind them was a black wolf. Crimson whinnied. I tugged back on his reins and gasped, as his hooves kicked up dirt and leaves. Crimson snorted and stomped again. I patted his head to calm him. “Papa! What –? Why did you –?” “I was chasing a rabbit. So was this thing. I missed the rabbit but shot him.” His face turned to stone. “It’s meat.” I settled Crimson down with some effort. Then I made him canter forward at an easy pace. We paused behind Royale and I stared at the silent animal while Crimson quivered and snorted beneath me. 91 The wolf’s claws were open, as if they could still strike. The twisted jaws and fangs looked ready to devour. The open, unseeing eyes stared mindlessly at the sky. They were not blue-gray. I steadied my breathing as I studied the wolf. The wolf Papa had brought to our home. “It was all I could find,” he said in a softer tone. I focused on breathing in and out. In and out. “I understand,” I said. I turned Crimson away and urged him back to the cottage. Crimson tossed his head and gave another snort of agitation. He surely felt the same rage, seeing the creature that took his own mother from him last year. Though this animal was different from that monster. This was just an ordinary wolf. Mama gasped as Papa arrived at the front stoop. “Henri! What on earth –?” “All I could find,” he repeated. “Couldn’t let good meat go to waste. It’s dinner.” The sun continued to sink toward the horizon. The sky would grow black in another few hours and we would shut ourselves inside. I half-turned. “It’s dead?” “Of course,” Papa said. “I shot it.” I looked back at the horizon, shivering, though not because of the evening chill. “It’s all right,” I said. I heard Papa climb down from the saddle. Heard him untie the animal. The animal I didn’t want to see, though I already saw it in my every nightmare. 92 I set my jaw. “Turn,” I ordered Crimson, tugging his reins. We turned about to face it. The long black animal that could no longer harm anyone or anything, because Papa had shot it. It could no longer attack me, except in my dreams. It was dead. Crimson bristled beneath me, but he settled as I stroked his flank. As we faced the wolf together. Papa carried it to the carving table next to the sheep pen, as Crimson and I watched. Mama wrung her hands and followed him. I climbed down from Crimson’s back and led him toward them. Mama stared at the furry beast stretched across the flat surface. I heard Papa mutter, “It was the best I could do, my dear.” “I know,” she murmured back. She heaved a slow sigh, then held out her hand. Papa tugged the cleaver up from the wooden tabletop where he had buried it that morning. He handed it to Mama, then walked back toward the house. Mama stared at the dead beast another moment before she swung the cleaver down to hack off its head. Blood spurted up and dirtied her lace dress. She didn’t bother trying to clean it off. I hitched Crimson to the porch and followed Papa into the house. He grabbed his pipe from the mantle and lit it, then sat in his rocking chair, puffing away. I stood nearby but he would 93 not look at me, as he kept puffing and rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. “Papa, teach me to hunt.” He gagged and coughed a couple of times, his muddy boots stamping the floor as he bent forward. I feared he might choke on his tobacco. “… What did you say?” “Teach me to hunt,” I repeated. He continued to stare at me. Then he looked away, returning to his rocking and smoking. “You don’t need to hunt anything,” he said with a dismissive air. I relaxed my shoulders and stood taller. “You won’t always be around. I can’t stay indoors forever. Someday I’ll have to go out. And I’ll have to be prepared, if I ever meet one of them.” He waved me off. “No,” he said in a harsher tone, his smoke permeating the room. “You don’t need to worry about those wolves. They’re not your concern. Duke Laurent will have the King send soldiers to handle them.” I took a step forward. “Papa. No soldiers are coming. We’re the only soldiers we have.” He puffed in silence, staring at nothing. He leaned forward and swiped his hand over his forehead. As if he wanted to wipe away everything that had happened. Grand’Mere’s death. My scars. Francois’ death. All the terror we lived with for the last two years. But nothing could wipe it away and he knew it. I could tell, as he hung his head and shut his eyes. 94 “I know you want to protect me, Papa. But even if I stayed here forever, what’s to stop the wolves from breaking in the windows, like they did at Francois’ house?” His eyes flashed at me in a sudden rage. As if he had never considered that possibility. Or as if he had considered it for many nights since Francois’ death, but knew he could do nothing about it. “Papa, I need you to really protect me. Protect me by showing me how to protect myself.” He stared at the far wall, as if I no longer stood in the room. He puffed at his pipe, the smoke rising in gray wisps. “I’ll think on it,” he said. “Go settle the horses.” I walked out front, leaving him to smoke, his head in his hand. I stepped outside and unhitched Crimson. Then I gathered Royale by the reins and led him past Mama to the stable, settling him in his stall and giving him some water. I stepped outside the stable to catch Crimson’s eye and whistled for him. He sprang from his place and charged at me in a gallop. He knew how fast to come by how shrill and sharp I whistled. He snorted once at the wolf carcass as he passed, then thundered to a stop beside me. I patted his head and hugged his neck. “Good boy, Crimson. That was fast. Someday you might even beat Diamond.” Crimson tossed his head and snorted again, as if he knew I was daring to compare him with Pierre’s horse. I led him back to his stall with my hand on his back, as he shook twice. 95 “I know,” I said, petting him. “I know you’re angry about the wolf. But it’s not the thing that killed your mother. It’s just a wolf, and it’s dead. And someday we’ll figure out how to get rid of those things, whatever they are. All right? We’ll make sure they never hurt anyone again.” After removing both of their saddles, I drew Crimson’s water and petted him some more, wishing I could ease his mind. He continued to stamp and fidget, glancing back at the stable entrance twice. As if the wolf could rise from Mama’s work table and attack us. I kept petting him. “It’s all right. You’re safe with me now. And I won’t let anything hurt you, ever again.” I continued to smooth his mane and his neck, and he breathed easier. Then he perked up and glanced at the entrance. Papa stood there within the stable, his hands at his sides. The pipe smoldered silently from his hip. His mustached face was in shadow within the waning light and I couldn’t see his features. “If you wish to hunt, you must do exactly as I say, without question. You will step where I tell you to step. You will keep silent when I tell you to keep silent. You will shoot when I tell you to shoot. Whatever I tell you to do, you cannot hesitate. Understood?” I shuddered. “Yes, Papa.” He stood there, a husky shadow, as if we stood in someone’s tomb. “You’ll rise early tomorrow. As soon as you finish your chores, we’ll head into the woods.” 96 The woods. Where the black wolf spoke to me. Where it watched and waited for me as I hurried to Grand’Mere’s house. “… yes, Papa.” His shadow nodded, then brought the smoldering pipe to his lips and strode back to the house. I stood there, frozen. I petted Crimson again, my fingers trembling against him. “You see? I told you. There’s nothing to worry about. We’re going to learn how to hunt, and then we won’t have to be afraid of anything anymore.” I laid my head against his, wondering how I would make myself sleep tonight. “Everything’s going to be all right, Crimson, I promise,” I said. “Tomorrow morning, we’re going back into the woods.” 97 98 99 MY RISE 100 101 11. I smiled and patted Crimson’s neck as Papa and Royale led us out of the dark forest. The large buck I had shot scraped through pine needles on the ground behind Royale, tied to his saddle. It was my twelfth deer since we had started hunting over a year ago. Papa kept glancing back at it, beaming. He said this one was bigger than any animal he had ever killed. Before we mounted the horses to head home, he actually chuckled and clapped me on the back. 102 Sunlight glinted through the trees, now in full bloom, their leaves still wet with mist and mountain fog. I closed my eyes a moment. I no longer minded feeling the sun on my triple-scarred face. The long days of summer were just a month away, when we could stay outside longer, riding and hunting. I unfastened the side holster of Crimson’s saddle, which held Papa’s crossbow. He had given me his old weapon from the war to use for hunting, until I was ready to borrow his musket. But I never felt the need to switch. I loaded a bolt and hung the crossbow’s front end down over my right shoe as we rode. I looped its front strap over my toe and yanked up tight, feeling my firm bicep muscle twitch as I locked the bolt into place. “What are you doing back there, Helena?” Papa asked, not bothering to look. “Keeping myself ready.” I could hear the smile in his voice, as he relaxed in the saddle and took in the view of the fir and pine trees. He had trained me to stay prepared, to watch for signs of danger, to survive against predators in the forest. He hardly asked me questions anymore while we hunted, but whenever he did, I answered correctly. “Ready for what?” he asked. “Anything.” He chuckled again. “Exactly, sweetheart. Exactly.” I sat taller in the saddle, enjoying the easy ride home, the gentle breeze on my face, and the sounds of the waking forest. When we had started 103 hunting, every rustling leaf or calling bird made me flinch. I had tripped over my dress several times trying to cross a stream or climb over large rocks. I lost three slippers in the mud before Papa built me a pair of wooden shoes. I wanted boots like his, but we could hardly afford a second pair, just to train a girl how to hunt. The first few months, I didn’t have the strength to even arm the crossbow, let alone shoot straight. When I did shoot, I was terrified. Afraid of missing and afraid of killing. “Shove your fear aside,” Papa had told me. “Shove it aside and shoot.” I followed all of his instructions, as I had promised. No matter how pointless or exhausting it seemed. No matter how many bruises and cuts and open blistering sores my mother had to clean off of me later. Until I learned to clean them myself. Over the last eighteen months, I had grown stronger, faster and stealthier. I learned to measure the landscape before entering it, to avoid snapping twigs or slipping on a muddy patch of ground. A few months ago, I finally developed the strength to arm my crossbow from the saddle, something even a boy my age would struggle to do. I enjoyed my new strength, to help Papa lift a deer carcass from the ground. To chase Valiant through the meadow for several minutes before I started breathing heavily. And to carry two large buckets of water from the nearby well, though Papa still watched me travel the whole distance, resting on the porch with his musket ready. 104 But he allowed me more and more freedom and asked me to help with more chores. I turned eleven last month, and I had developed strength and skills to rival that of most boys. Strength to survive. As we broke through the trees to enter our meadow, Valiant barked from his place beside the sheep pen and ran to meet us. Mama watched from the stoop as we approached. She didn’t stand like she usually did, but kept sewing. My kill today would catch her attention. I led Crimson to trot over to her, beaming as Papa and I dismounted to untie the deer. Together, we dragged it to the carving table and hoisted it up. The heavy buck’s antlers cracked as it struck the oak surface in a heap. Mama’s nose wrinkled as if a skunk had sprayed us. “A good hunt?” she asked. I spread my hands toward the enormous deer and smiled, saying nothing more. Valiant barked, as if voicing his agreement. “Come inside and wash up,” Mama said. “Your father can clean the deer.” “It’s a large one,” he said. “I would like some help to –.” “I want a few moments to speak with Helena.” Papa gaped. Mama rarely dared to interrupt him. He bent to retrieve the cleaver that the deer’s carcass had knocked to the ground, wiped it on his tunic, and set to work. They must have agreed beforehand on whatever Mama wished to discuss. I couldn’t tell if it might be good or bad news, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t afraid anymore. 105 Of anything. Then she led me inside and told me she was going to have a baby. 106 12. “Can’t catch me!” Suzette giggled, dodging this way and that through our meadow. Her wooly blanket trailed behind, clutched in her tiny fist as she ran her hardest in the waning sunlight. “Oh, I’ll catch you!” I laughed back, stepping sideways to block her escape. “Or I will!” Pierre said, rushing to her other side. Suzette squealed as Valiant ran around us all, barking. We pretended my four-year old sister was too fast and agile for two fifteen-year olds to grab. We reached for her, missing each time, 107 which made her laugh harder. “Come here, you!” I demanded in a playful tone. “No!” she called, her short legs turning awkwardly to hurry away. Pierre was better at pretending. He kept jumping right next to Suzette, while Valiant barked around his ankles to make sure he wasn’t harming her. Then he would nearly snatch the back of her cotton dress before his fingers closed on empty air. “Missed again! I can’t believe it!” “Too bad for you!” Suzette called. I leaped in front of her as she turned away from the bare trees of the forest. She shrieked and retreated as Pierre barred her escape in the other direction. Then I landed behind her and seized the trailing end of her blanket. “My woolie!” She grinned and grunted as she tugged at her blanket, refusing to let go. I dragged her closer and scooped her into the air. “We got her!” Pierre called. He knelt down to pet Valiant, who had started to growl. “Got you by your fuzzy woolie!” I said. I knew she wouldn’t release it. Mama made it for her two years ago and Suzette had held tight to it ever since, the way I used to guard my red cloak. She struggled to pull free. “Lemme go! And gimme my fuzzy woolie or I’ll beat your head! Nngh!” Her tiny fingers tried to pry my arm loose. Until I turned her around and held her against my chest. Then she threw her blanket over my shoulder, flung her arms around my neck and held on tight. “Take me for a big ride.” 108 “All right, hang on!” I trotted like a horse, running in small circles around the chilly meadow, while Pierre ruffled Valiant’s fur. Suzette giggled as I bounced her up and down. Crimson snorted at us from the sheep pen, where he had been trotting. I had trained him to stay close by, even when he wasn’t hitched up, to show Papa how well we could take care of ourselves. Crimson appreciated the freedom, but now he seemed eager to join us. Winter was coming, and he wouldn’t have many days left to gallop before being cooped up in the barn until springtime. “No, no!” Suzette said, laughing. “Take me for a big ride on Crimson!” I whirled her around in the air and plopped her down on her feet. Crimson paced before the sheep pen like a guard dog, stealing glances at us. I bent toward Suzette and lowered my voice. “You know we can’t ride very long.” “I know, I know,” she said with a frown. She rolled her eyes and made a stern face like Papa’s. “‘It’s almost dark, girls. We don’t wanna be caught out after dark.’” “That’s right,” I said, stifling a smile. “But we can gallop twice around the meadow if you want.” She shook her head and leaned toward me with a wicked grin. “Let’s go scare all the sheeps,” she said. I glanced sideways at our empty front porch. “… I don’t know.” 109 “Aw, come on! Papa won’t hear us. They’ve been talking in there for days!” “More like an hour.” “Don’t know about what?” Pierre asked. I curled my lip. “Suzette wants to scare the sheep.” Pierre raised an eyebrow. “You told me what he said last time you did that.” “They probably won’t even hear us from the house,” I suggested. “Probably not,” he agreed. “Mama could probably keep your mother talking all night, if she wanted.” “I like Madame Lisette,” Suzette said, curling her arms around her blanket. “She plays with me.” “I like her, too,” I said. I cocked my head at Pierre. “You call her ‘Mama’?” He shrugged. “Sure. She’s been my stepmother over a year now.” “But you still miss your mother?” “Yeah,” he said, nodding sideways at the house. “But she’s my mother now.” “I suppose.” “Will you guys stop talking about mothers and start scaring the sheeps?” Suzette demanded, jamming her fists on her hips. We laughed. “Sorry, Suzette.” “What were we thinking?” Pierre said. He glanced at the porch for any sign of movement. “Just be careful, Red.” 110 “How come you always call Helena ‘Red’?” Suzette asked. “Is it ‘cause of her scratches on her face? ‘Cause that’s not nice.” Pierre shuddered. “Uh, no. Of course not. It’s because, uh …” I put up a hand. “She’s just curious.” I bent toward Suzette. “It’s because I used to wear a red cloak all the time, Suzette. When I was around your age.” “But you don’t anymore. So how come he calls you that still?” I smiled. “Some things just stick with you.” Suzette waved me off. “All right, fine. You can be ‘Red’. Let’s just scare the sheeps.” “All right, Silly.” I whistled for Crimson. He galloped straight at us. I peered around his flank to eye the porch once more. Pierre looked over his shoulder from the grass as he kept Valiant still. It always felt so peaceful when the Leónes came to visit. Monsieur Leóne seemed content with Madame Leóne, who was as good a seamstress as Mama. Their wedding two summers ago brought us a breath of fresh air, after years of gloom. Nearly as refreshing as the day Suzette was born. Signs of new life, that people could start over. And Pierre seemed even happier than usual since the wedding. Over the last few years he had grown stronger, a few inches taller, and far more confident. He had become highly skilled as a blacksmith’s apprentice, but he never even talked about it unless someone needed his assistance. He 111 treated all of our animals well, and he was wonderful for Suzette. I couldn’t think of a single day when he had failed to make her smile. I lifted Suzette onto Crimson’s back and placed her in front of the saddle. She sucked on her blanket as I hoisted myself up behind her. “Hold on tight,” I said. I wrapped my arm around her and she coiled her tiny arms around mine. Then she squealed as I urged Crimson forward and we charged at the sheep pen. The sheep heard us thundering at them and paused, searching all around for the source of the tremors. Spotting us, a few of them panicked and nearly stumbled sideways over one another, while the others kept chewing on their straw. “Run! Run, sheeps!” Suzette cried. “We’re gonna get you, sheeps!” “HELENA!” I yanked on the reins. Crimson skidded to a halt. I clutched Suzette so tight I feared I might cut off her air. Instead of wheezing, she laughed. I sat up and turned toward Papa’s booming voice. Pierre clenched his teeth, wincing at me. “Yes, Papa?” I asked in a quiet voice. Papa stood on the porch, his face flushed around his black frown of a moustache. “What on earth are you doing? You trying to give them a heart attack?” “Papa, the sheeps are so really funny!” Suzette giggled. 112 His face darkened. “They won’t be so really funny if they’re dead.” “But, Papa! You should’ve seen how the sheeps –!” I nudged her. “Hush, Suzette. Trust me, he knows.” Papa continued to glower at us, until even Crimson looked away. “Helena, I suggest you show more care around our flock, if you plan to join me on the hunt tomorrow.” “When can I go on a hunt?” Suzette asked. “I wanna go on a hunt tomorrow, too.” Papa blinked. “When you’re much older.” “I’m much older now. I just turned four. That’s as old as Helena was when it was the first time she hunted.” “I was nine,” I told her. “So? I’m almost nine, too.” I smiled. “Four is not almost nine. Or even close.” She soured and looked away. “Well, it is to me.” “All right, girls, get inside,” Papa said, waving us into the house. “It’s almost dark. We don’t want to be caught out after dark.” I tightened my lips to hold in a laugh. “Papa!” Suzette called, laughing out loud. “We were just saying –!” “Hush, Suzette!” I told her. “Let’s get Crimson bedded and go inside.” I dismounted and lifted Suzette down, then led Crimson to the stable. It was one of the few times I had to take his reins. He didn’t like being 113 cooped up in the stable, and I hated leaving him there, out in the open air. At least we had a lock on the door. Pierre joined us with a guilty smile. “Sorry, Red. I was watching you and Suzette ride and suddenly he was right there.” Valiant barked at Pierre’s heels, as if supporting his claim. “He has a way of doing that. It’s all right. Papa will forget about it eventually.” He entered the dusty stable with us. I unsaddled Crimson and stroked his neck to calm him, like always. Crimson fidgeted and kept checking Royale’s stall, as if making certain the horse was still there. “Is he always this agitated at night?” Pierre asked. I kept stroking Crimson, speaking in soft tones. “I don’t think he ever got over being trapped in Francois’ stall when the wolves came. He couldn’t do anything to stop it. Just had to stay there and watch, while they –.” I glanced down at Suzette. “Well, Francois’ mare, Lightning, was his mother.” “Helena, how come I can’t hunt? I’ll be good. I wanna be like you.” “Oh, you do?” Pierre bent down beside her. “You wanna shoot rabbits from fifty feet away like Red?” I blushed. “Pierre. That was only one time.” He ignored me and dropped to one knee, spreading his hands to make it more dramatic. “Your papa told me about it,” he said as Suzette 114 sucked on her blanket. “He and Red were out early one morning and they spied this rabbit way up ahead, moving behind an oak tree. They didn’t want to move any further or the horses would’ve scared it off. So they stood there, drawing their weapons. Your papa’s musket and Red’s crossbow.” “It’s actually Papa’s crossbow, from the war, actually,” Suzette told him. She learned the word “actually” last month and now used it whenever she could. “Sure, I know. Anyway, they were about fifty feet away, too far to get a good shot, so they were gonna creep up closer. Your papa took one step forward, real quiet. Then something spooked the rabbit. Maybe he sensed they were there, I don’t know. But he took off running and your papa figured they had lost it. But while he was thinking that, Red drew her crossbow in a flash. She fired one shot, straight at the rabbit, and sent it flying into a tree behind it. One shot. Fifty feet away. It was amazing. Your papa came bragging about it the same day at my papa’s shop, kept telling it to everybody who would listen. Some folks didn’t believe him, but I’ve heard plenty of other stories about Red’s hunting, so I know it’s true. She’s a better hunter than any of the men in town, but nobody wants to admit it.” “All right, Pierre, that’s enough,” I said, my cheeks burning. “Don’t fill her head with stories.” “Well, it’s true.” 115 I sighed, not wanting to discuss the details with both of them together. “It wasn’t exactly fifty feet.” “No?” “No,” I said firmly. I turned away, keeping my smile to myself. By Papa’s measure from the trees where we stood, it was fifty-eight. Actually. “Well, it’s still an impressive shot, Red. One of many.” His eyes lit up and he turned back to Suzette. “Your papa told me about another time when they –!” “Pierre, no more hunting stories. It’s time to settle down for the night.” “I like Pierre’s hunting stories!” Suzette complained. “How come I can’t go hunt with you and Papa, just for one time?” I stroked Crimson’s neck, as his eyes darted back and forth at the stable’s confining walls. Yes, how come? I wondered. Like Papa always said, we needed to be ready. Ready for anything. Pierre felt I could handle myself well enough. But what about Suzette? Who would protect her when the wolves came? I hugged Crimson’s neck, my fingers brushing back his mane as he gradually relaxed. “I’ll talk to Papa,” I said. “No promises.” Suzette’s whole face brightened. “Yay! I’m gonna be like you!” Pierre stood, looking pleased with himself. I hoisted Suzette into my arms. “Well, I want to be like you,” I said, stepping outside. She started one of her silly songs. “I wanna be like you, and you wanna be like me. And we 116 wanna be like Crimson. And Crimson wants to be a tree.” I set her down to close the stall door and lock it. “I doubt Crimson wants to be a tree.” “He has to. ‘Cuz that’s what rhymes.” “Why don’t we let Crimson be whatever he wants.” She ignored me and started up again, dancing in a circle. “And Crimson wants to be a tree. Or a butterfly. Or a frog. And Pierre likes to call you ‘Red’. ‘Cuz you blush when he’s around – !” “Shush!” I scolded her in a sharp voice. “Well, you do. Go see your face. It’s all –.” “‘Quiet’, I said. It’s almost time for bed.” “No, it’s not, either. I can –!” “Shush,” I told her, picking her up again to settle her. Suzette grumbled and sucked on her blanket, while Pierre tightened his lips, looking amused. I forced an awkward smile. “… She’s four.” He nodded with a grin. We heard a horse approaching. Shadowed against the setting sun, Father Vestille trotted toward our stoop on his gray Palomino. My gut went hollow. “Hello, Helena! Pierre! Suzette!” “Father Vestille!” Suzette squirmed like a fish until I set her down. She ran at Father Vestille, waving her blanket. He climbed down from his saddle and scooped her up. “Oh, you’re so heavy!” he joked. “How much candy have you eaten today?” 117 She giggled. “I’m not heavy, neither, Father Vestille.” He held her over his head and twirled her about. The same way he did with me, when I was only a child. “I can barely lift you!” he said. Suzette squealed, Pierre laughed, and Valiant barked. As I stood rigid, watching them. “Time to get inside, Suzette,” I said at last. “Awww.” Father Vestille stopped, surprised. He managed a smile and set her down. “Your sister’s right. Sorry I’m visiting so late in the day.” “Abier! How are you?” Papa appeared on the porch, with Mama and the Leónes behind him. He marched at Father Vestille and gave him a strong embrace. “How have you been, Henri?” They broke apart, looking a bit awkward. “We didn’t know when you’d be back,” Papa said. “Neither did I. I wanted to let you know I’ll be here this Sunday.” “We still gather.” Papa nodded toward the smiling group on the porch. “I’ve been leading prayers. Last weekend we discussed showing honor to the King, in spite of any rumors and misgivings.” He smiled sheepishly. “It was a humbling experience.” Father Vestille laughed and clapped him on the back. “You’re a good man, Henri. There’s no one I would rather have leading prayers when I’m away.” “Come inside. Have some wine.” They started toward the house. 118 “Only a little. I want to be up early tomorrow, visit some people in the village. I just got back and came here first.” “Why are we so special?” I asked. Papa and Father Vestille stopped where they stood. Everyone gaped at me. Father Vestille gave me his kindest eyes, the ones I remembered from years ago. “Because there’s no one I care more about than you and your family, Helena.” I said nothing. Just stared back at him. Mama stepped down from the porch and extended a hand toward him. “Come on in. Lisette brought over some fresh bread. She’s trying to convince me to start a clothing business together.” Father Vestille smiled. “You should. Between the two of you, you could already supply nearly half the dresses of the village.” Mama laughed. Madame Leóne stuck her hands on her hips with a clever grin. “Well, Father Vestille, most women won’t buy half a dress.” Everyone laughed, including Pierre, making Valiant bark again. I stiffened and waited for everyone to go inside. “Madame Lisette!” Suzette called, running to her. “Madame Suzette!” Madame Leóne smiled and squatted down. “How may I be of service?” Madame Leóne was beautiful like Mama, but in a different way. Although a few years older, she always looked radiant, her eyes crinkling at the corners with constant humor. 119 “I want you and Mama to make a special hunting dress ‘cuz I’m gonna go hunting with Helena!” Papa glared at me. So much for easing into the conversation. But he didn’t scold me. He only wrinkled his brow as he continued past Mama, who gaped at me from the porch. “Oh, a special hunting dress,” Madame Leóne said, playing along. “How about a little more blueberry pie instead?” “No! I wanna have my special hunting dress!” “Well, we’ll have to see about that with your Mama and Papa, I think. Come on inside.” Yes, we will, I thought as the adults meandered into the house. Pierre lingered outside a moment with me. Madame Leóne regarded him, then gave me a sly wink before ushering Suzette inside with a hand at her back. Mama threw a smiling glance at me before following them inside. I shook my head at their overactive imaginations. Pierre shoved his hands in his trouser pockets. “How come you’re mad at Father Vestille?” I turned and started walking away, past the bleating sheep. “Who said I’m mad?” “You did, with everything you’re doing. Figured you’d start throwing rocks at him next.” I didn’t want to talk about it. “We used to be close, when I was little,” I said. “Then I grew up. That’s it.” 120 “Red.” He stopped walking and faced me. “You act like he stole your horse. What did he do that’s so horrible?” I stiffened, wanting to turn away yet wanting to answer him. I knew I could still talk to Pierre about anything. Even this. “Nothing,” I said in a feeble voice, feeling myself tremble. “He didn’t do anything. When the wolf attacked, Francois came and killed it. Father Vestille came and helped get me to Doctor Renoire. After that – he stopped coming around.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “He’s at your house all the time.” I shook my head. “He used to visit us every Sunday for lunch and stay until dark. Some weeks he visited us a couple more times. Then the wolf killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me like this, and he started to disappear, making long trips to other provinces. Refusing to tell us where he was or what he was doing or why he had to go. He won’t admit that he’s looking for a better church to lead, in some province that’s not plagued by wolves.” Pierre dug his hands in his pockets and resumed our aimless stroll through the meadow. The sun dipped low, and I expected Papa’s voice to thunder from the front stoop at any moment. Don’t be caught out after dark, Helena. “Doesn’t fit,” Pierre said. “The way he preaches, the way he helps people. He’s been close to your parents since he moved here. Can’t see him moving on to another group of people.” I bit my lip. “Shows how wrong you can be about someone. You think he’ll be there when you 121 really need him. Then when there’s trouble, he’s nowhere around.” “Hmm,” Pierre said. “Well. Glad you’re not mad.” “Look, I just don’t –.” “Easy, Red. I’m teasing you. Will I still see you at Mass Sunday? I can find you a good spot at the back to throw rocks.” “I’ll be there. I can’t tell Mama and Papa I refuse to go. But don’t expect me to listen to anything he says.” Pierre fell silent. “You still pray?” “Of course,” I said. “Every morning and every night. But I haven’t gotten any answers yet.” “You’ve got Suzette, right? I never thought you’d love anything more than that crazy horse of yours. That’s an answer to prayer, isn’t it, having a sister?” I smiled. “Yes. It is.” My heart sank again as I turned toward the dismal forest. “But those things are still out there.” “You mean the wolves?” “They’re not wolves. I heard another lady was attacked a few months ago.” “Yeah, Madame Benoit, the miller’s wife. We went to the funeral.” “Was Father Vestille there?” “Uh, no. He was away. Another priest, Monsieur Benoit’s cousin, came from Dijon to lead the service.” “Hm. Surprising. The one thing Father Vestille rarely misses is a funeral.” 122 “You are really angry at him. Don’t you think you should give him another chance?” I considered that for all of two seconds. “He used to be there for our family. Now he’s not. And I’ve moved on. I needed him back then. I don’t need him now.” Pierre sighed deeply, dropping the subject. “All right. What’re you doing tomorrow?” “Helena!” We turned toward the sound of Papa’s voice, about fifty yards away. I barely noticed how far we had strayed. “Come on back. Pierre’s parents are about to head home and you don’t want to be caught out after dark. And you and I need to talk to your mother about Suzette joining us early tomorrow.” My pulse raced. “Yes, Papa!” I called back. So. He didn’t say that they needed to talk to Suzette, but that the two of us to talk to Mama. “Sounds like I’m going hunting,” I told Pierre. 123 13. The forest was cold and quiet the next morning, hardly a bird left to whistle among the naked branches. But we still hoped to find a few animals roaming about, if we could spot any through the clinging fog. We slowed to a trot and listened for movements. Papa rode ahead on Royale while Suzette sat in front of me on Crimson, clutching her blanket – her “fuzzy woolie”. Still as she was, I kept imagining that her racing heartbeat would frighten off every creature we approached. She had practically bounced up 124 and down when we left the cottage. But Papa instructed her – as he had instructed me on my first hunt – to obey his every command and keep silent in the forest. He put up a hand. I pulled Crimson to a halt. Papa rode Royale a few steps closer, one hoof at a time, his hand still raised to us. Suzette’s pulse thumped against me through her back but she kept still, sucking on her blanket. She would make an excellent hunter one day. As soon as she gave up her fuzzy woolie. My eyes narrowed on the area Papa faced. Then I spotted it: a large white-tailed buck emerging from a cluster of trees, bending to nibble some grass. I might never have noticed it through the dense fog without frightening it away, but Papa had a keen sense for subtle movements. He raised his musket and took aim between the spread antlers. The deer’s head suddenly jerked up as something pounced on top of it. Something large. The enormous shadow spread over the deer, making Suzette scream. I clamped my hand over her mouth as the beast stopped and turned on us. I gasped. It was the wolf, black as night. Its blue-gray eyes stabbed into us as its head rose, as tall as the deer’s neck. The buck staggered to its feet and fled, with the monster chasing it. Papa drove Royale after them. “Papa, stop!” I cried. 125 I tugged on Crimson’s reins. “Hyah!” We galloped after them, my crossbow raised. Suzette squealed and gathered her blanket close to her chest, grasping Crimson’s mane as I goaded him faster. The trees blurred past as I fixed my eyes on Papa and Royale, struggling to keep sight of them rushing through the fog. Ahead of them, I caught shadowy glimpses of the escaping wolf. “Come on, Crimson. Go!” Suzette screamed. “Stop, Helena! Stop!” I ignored her and drove Crimson harder. Royale began to pull away. I barely caught sight of the wolf’s whipping tail. As Crimson leaped over a thick tree root, Suzette slid sideways. She hung from the saddle as we sailed through the air. I yanked on the reins and clutched her to my chest as we toppled over. Crimson fell on my leg like a pile of stones and I screamed. He rose off me instantly, letting my heels slide and fall limply from the stirrups. I lay there and cradled Suzette, trying to stop her from squirming. I bit my lip and waited for feeling to return to my leg. After a few minutes, I managed to calm her down, assuring her I could still walk. My crossbow lay on the ground near my hand. It had fired its bolt when we fell. There was no time to search for it. “Bring me another bolt,” I groaned. Suzette got up quickly, smearing away tears with her blanket. She ran to the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle and returned with a new bolt. I sat on the ground and put my left foot in the crossbow’s loop. I leaned back and tugged 126 the bowstring taut to arm it, thankful to have one strong leg. I crawled to a nearby tree for support and stood to my feet. I limped to Crimson and he nuzzled me with his neck, as I lifted my long skirt to check my injury. The purpling bruise on my thigh and knee would spread over the next few days, but it would heal. A gunshot echoed through the trees. We froze. I grabbed Suzette and lifted her onto Crimson, clenching my teeth against the numbing pain. Gripping the horn tight, I planted my foot in the stirrup and hoisted myself up, swinging my dead leg over his back. Crimson hesitated at first, sensing my injury, but I urged him on and he tore after Papa with all speed. It took less than a minute to reach a clearing where we found the deer. Or rather, its head, ripped from its neck and lying in a pool of blood. There was no body. Near the head, Papa’s musket lay in the dirt, spattered with blood. I blocked Suzette’s eyes with my forearm and stared at Papa’s weapon. Just stared, holding Crimson in position. Unwilling – unable – to move forward. I finally turned Crimson away at a slow canter, leading him and Suzette to some thick brush and trees several yards away. “Wait here.” “Helena. Wasn’t that Papa’s –?” “Wait here, I said!” Suzette sniffed. “Don’t yell.” 127 I cradled her carefully. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to yell. But do as I say. Sit here and keep still.” She sniffed and buried her face in the blanket. “I hate this forest.” I hugged her tight, then swung my leg over the saddle and dropped down. The jarring pain rang all the way from my leg to my neck. I limped all the way back to the clearing to retrieve Papa’s musket. It was still warm. I could smell the gunpowder from its recent shot. He missed shooting whatever attacked him. Or his bullet failed to stop it. Something rustled through the bushes at my left. I dropped the musket and aimed my crossbow at the approaching footsteps. Father Vestille strode from the forest on his Palomino, right into my sight. He flinched as his horse started a little. I lowered the crossbow. “Helena? What –?” “Papa’s missing.” My words came out half-choked. His eyes widened at the bloody musket. He scanned the area. “Which way?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. I didn’t see. Somewhere back that direction.” His face turned to iron. “Take Suzette home and round up some men. Go.” “I’m coming with you.” “Take your sister home!” I bit my lip. I knew he was right. She had already seen too much. But I couldn’t lose the chance to find Papa. 128 I had to trust Father Vestille to find him. I hobbled quickly back to Crimson as Father Vestille galloped off. We raced home, faster than ever. It felt like forever. When we finally reached the cottage, Mama sat waiting on the front stoop, as always. Suzette screamed for her and Mama came running. I left Suzette with her. Suzette babbled, waving her blanket wildly as Mama hugged her tight. Mama turned to me with frantic eyes. “What happened? Where’s your father?” “I don’t know. Father Vestille’s searching for him. I’m going back.” “Helena, wait!” I sped away. I had no time to find more men in the village. Who would I find? Who would listen to me, other than the Leónes? Every moment spent asking for help was another moment lost. We pounded back into the darkness of the forest. A few minutes later, we reached the spot where Father Vestille had met me. I yanked the reins, jarring Crimson to a halt, and listened. Crimson followed my lead and kept still, while my heart beat like a drum. Something wailed. We charged toward it, darting around tree trunks. I ground my teeth, the crossbow in my fist. A dark figure knelt on the ground ahead. Crimson skidded to a halt as I aimed at the man in black. 129 It was Father Vestille, bent over on the ground. Sobbing as he clutched a scarlet cloth to his chest. It was Papa’s tunic. Covered in blood. I smelled the drying puddles of blood scattered throughout the area. I saw pieces of Papa. A scarlet finger. A boot with part of the torn leg still inside. Some piece of indistinguishable flesh lying mangled against a tree trunk. Bile rose at the back of my throat but I stilled it. Crimson snorted and stamped his hooves, sharing my shock and rage. Father Vestille simply wept, doubled over my father’s tunic, rocking back and forth. I searched in all directions, listening, smelling the air. Nothing but pine and decay from my father’s blood. Father Vestille finally rose, clutching Papa’s shirt. He trudged to his horse, hanging his head. His robe covered with Papa’s blood. “We must tell your mother,” he rasped. I kept scanning the trees, kept listening for movement. My grip ached on the crossbow. Something rustled in the bushes. I whirled and fired as a reflex, pinning a small rabbit to the dirt. It let out a pitiful squeal as my bolt pierced its belly. I examined it. Papa would have been impressed by my quick reaction. I studied the rabbit another few seconds. Then bent to grab another bolt from the saddle pouch, loaded it with my left boot, and waited. 130 There were no sounds. Only the bunny’s plaintive cries. No more of Papa’s booming voice, ordering me inside. No more of his smile or his pride in my latest kill. No more of his horsey-rides with Suzette bouncing on his shoulders. No more of his quiet kisses to Mama when he thought we weren’t looking. The forest was still. I dismounted and limped to the rabbit, gritting through the pain. I jammed the bolt deeper and worked it back and forth until the rabbit stopped struggling. I picked it up and tied it to the saddle. “Dinner,” I said as I dragged myself back onto Crimson. “Helena …” Father Vestille began in a broken voice. I met his gaze. “Can’t let good meat go to waste,” I told him, urging Crimson forward. We rode back to the clearing. I pulled Crimson to a halt and climbed down to gather up Papa’s musket. I wiped off some of the blood – Papa’s blood – on my burlap cloak. I cleaned it slowly, thinking about how Papa used his gun. How careful he was in the forest, how quick he was to fire. He must have shot the wolf. But it still killed him. And it still lived, somewhere in the blackness. I secured the musket to Crimson’s saddle beside the hanging rabbit. I mounted, allowing no more tears to start, no time to think. Only to act. I 131 turned at a sudden sound and stared at Father Vestille. “Did you hear that?” He looked about. I had jarred him out of his grief. “I – I don’t know. What did you hear?” I glared at him and wondered if I was going mad. “Perhaps nothing. We should go.” I stared at the path leading out of the forest, setting my jaw. “Don’t want to get caught out after dark.” We turned the horses back to the cottage. But I still felt an unsettling tremor in my spine. I could not possibly have heard what I imagined. Still, I glanced over my shoulder again as we rode toward home. From the dark recesses of the forest, I could have sworn I heard some wild animal laughing. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over Papa’s body. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as though he could see Papa’s face beneath the heavy lid. “Henri Basque – was my dearest friend. A kind man who always looked out for others. Always wanted to provide for others. Protect others. Shelter others. Even in his death, he died protecting his daughters from a dangerous animal as he – as he chased after it.” 132 I sensed people staring at me. I was thankful to have Mama and Suzette beside me, with Pierre and his parents sitting nearby. “Henri and Celeste invited me here after they came and settled, when they saw there had been no priest for several years. They allowed me to stay with them, until I was able to purchase my own hovel. They supported the new church here, attending regularly and helping draw others in. Henri wanted to provide for people’s spiritual needs as well as their material needs. He lived his life providing for others, and he died protecting his daughters.” Mama withdrew one of her embroidered handkerchiefs and dabbed at her bloodshot eyes. She looked too tired to weep anymore. I felt hollow inside as Father Vestille concluded his eulogy. The Mass ended and the casket was carried outside by Monsieur Leóne, Duke Laurent, and four other men. They put thick ropes under the casket and lowered it down into the giant pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Papa’s body there. Pierre stood beside me. “Weird.” I said nothing, but waited for him to continue. “I mean, you’re certain your father wouldn’t have missed. But if he hit the wolf, why couldn’t they find it? It couldn’t have gotten far.” I didn’t answer. I just stared into the dark hole. 133 He cleared his throat. “Sorry, Red. I shouldn’t keep talking about the wolves.” He stepped away to join his parents. I stood stiff and unmoving, saying nothing at all. “I’m so sorry, Madame,” Duke Laurent was telling Mama as he led her gently by the hand. “Henri was one of the best men I’ve ever known.” He had a slight catch in his throat. “If there’s anything I can do for your family, please let me know and it will be done.” “That is very kind of you, Monsieur,” Mama said, sounding frail and numb. She turned tired eyes on me. “Helena. Are you ready to go home?” I nodded, wrapped my burlap cloak around my shoulders, and put an arm around Suzette as she clutched her blanket. We returned home in silence. The Leónes stayed with us that afternoon, along with Father Vestille. I know Mama and Suzette needed their company, but apart from Pierre, I was relieved when they all left before dusk. Leaving the house dark and quiet. Mama wanted to talk to me after she put Suzette to bed but I didn’t feel like talking. I didn’t feel like doing anything at all. I retired early and cried myself to sleep. 134 14. “The beast has returned!” I looked up to see Jacque Denue and his four cronies beside the stoop of the Leónes’ blacksmith shop as I exited with my new crossbow bolts. They stood between me and Crimson, hitched to the post. “Told you this was her horse,” Denue said. He jutted his chin at me. “We told you not to come here anymore, you ugly witch. You deaf or just stupid?” 135 “I’ll leave the stupidity to you, Jacque. Step away from my horse.” “What did you say, you hag? Come here and I’ll beat some sense into you.” “Leave me alone. For your own well-being.” Jacque no longer frightened me, and I was in no mood for his nonsense. As a child, I had longed for Papa to rescue me from this brainless bully. Now, six months after Papa’s death, I had learned to take care of myself, along with Mama and Suzette. I had accompanied them in the forest an hour ago, to provide safe escort to Father Vestille’s hovel in the woods. They wanted me to join them for lunch, but I preferred to hunt. I couldn’t tell them I had no interest in visiting with Father Vestille, despite his frequent invitations over the past several months. Even though Mama said he had made a cake to celebrate my sixteenth birthday. He apparently wished to make up for all the time spent away from us, visiting other provinces the last several years. But I wasn’t interested in his penance. My attention had shifted to more important matters. I had assumed the role of hunter and provider for our family. Mama urged me to rest, to spend more time with them, insisting we had plenty of meat, especially with Father Vestille sharing meals with us. But I kept hunting, kept working. And I kept secretly searching for signs of the wolves that took Papa. But I never found them. They seemed to have gone into hiding, as if 136 frightened by the attention that Papa’s death had brought about. After another fruitless search in the woods, I had driven Crimson into the village of La Rue Sauvage to visit Pierre at his shop. I traded a few kills – a rabbit and three birds – for an order of new crossbow bolts, but lingered a few moments afterward. I had to admit, I found it far easier to make time to visit with Pierre. But entering the village brought its own share of risk, as Jacque Denue and his cruel friends meant to remind me. Denue snorted at a fat boy with food stains on his shirt. “Grab her, Port. I’m gonna give this witch a spanking.” The slob snatched at my arm. I dodged him easily and spun toward him, to hammer my locked fists into his face. He went down hard, but the folds of my skirt bunched around my legs, constricting my movements. As I stepped to one side to free up my movements, a taller boy seized my wrist. His fingers locked on me like a vise and jerked me toward Denue. Denue’s breath smelled of chewing tobacco. I tried to yank myself free but my dress remained twisted, keeping me off-balance. “I dunno how you did that, freak, but you’ll be sorry you did. I’m gonna beat you so bad you’ll never show your face outside again!” He raised his fist. Then something knocked his friend into him, forcing a grunt from Jacque as they both sailed to the ground. I tugged myself free of Muscles and stepped aside. 137 Crimson snorted down at the freckle-faced boy who lay sprawled on top of Denue, grimacing as he massaged his ribs. I felt a wave of relief as Crimson tried to kick at the rest of them. But they backed away from the post where I had tied him. I couldn’t get past them to set him loose. Then Slob picked up a rock and hurled it past my head. “Grab her!” Denue growled. Muscles lunged for me. I dodged, still struggling in my long dress. The others bent to pick up rocks, standing between me and Pierre’s door. I could call for help, but then they would throw rocks at Pierre. I hiked up my skirt and sprinted away. I could outrun them, but I had no place to escape between the closely-packed shops and houses. I hurried down an alley, their feet pounding after me. I crossed the next street and nearly fell beneath the wheels of an approaching carriage. The driver spotted me and jerked on the reins. Behind me, Denue and the others were closing in. I stood and ran to knock on the carriage door, seeing a young family inside. The woman saw my scarred face and screamed. “Please! Help me!” I cried. The man blinked and gaped as the woman pulled a small boy close. Over my shoulder, I glimpsed Jacque Denue and his friends charging toward me. I hurried past the coach and down the next alley. A rock sailed past me, missing my head and striking a wine barrel. 138 “Hey, now, stop that, you boys!” the driver called from behind. But he remained in his high seat as the boys’ feet skittered across the cobbled path. I rushed down the next busy street. “Help!” I called, to anyone who would listen. “Help me!” They all backed away, startled by my manner and my appearance. Men, women, children, all dressed well, all strong and healthy, stepped clear of me. Clearing a path for the boys to chase after me, shouting their threats. “We’re coming for you, Scars!” Jacque sang. “We’re gonna kill you!” one of his friends shouted. I ducked into another alley and glanced over my shoulder. The boys grinned like demons, sprinting after me with rocks in their fists. Ahead of me, the alley was bricked in. I gasped and turned, searching for a way out. I grabbed onto an upper ledge and tried to scale the wall. But my skirt made it impossible. “Trapped like a rat,” Denue said. His gang filled the mouth of the alley. “More like a scar-faced pig, I’d say,” Slob chimed in. Denue tossed a rock up and down in his palm. “This’ll help you remember to keep your ugly face out of our village, Scars.” He hurled it at me. I ducked and it struck the brick wall. Muscles threw another one. I dodged and jumped behind a wine barrel. I sat with my back to it, like a child hiding in a cellar. 139 “Come on out, Scars,” Denue demanded. “Come get your punishment.” Their footsteps strolled closer, taking their time. They threw another rock at the wall to frighten me. Which meant they had gathered enough of them to waste a few. My breath came in rapid gasps. I suddenly remembered the black wolf looming over me, mocking me. Knowing I could do nothing to stop it. Until Francois charged in with his ax and struck it dead. Shove your fear aside, Papa’s voice reminded me, the day I made my first kill. Shove it aside and shoot. I tried not to imagine the boys’ rocks striking my gut. My head. My face. I remembered the voice of my other hero, Francois. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped, he had urged. Stand up and do something. I looked around the empty alley, at the shrapnel of rocks and bricks scattered nearby. A broken wood plank lay among them. I seized it with both hands. I rose. The boys stared with surprise and delight. Denue hurled his rock at my eyes. I slapped it away with the plank and marched at them. Marched at Denue. The others fell silent and stopped. Muscles threw another stone. I smacked it against the wall and it shattered in half. Freckles hurled another one. I slammed it to the ground. 140 “Throw it!” Denue ordered the others. “Gimme the rock, then!” Slob surrendered his stone to Denue as I closed in. He tried to throw it but I smacked his wrist with the plank. He yelped as I jammed the end of the board into his chest and drove him back out of the alley with his friends. We emerged on the open street and I whacked him across the shoulder. He fell to the ground and rolled onto his back. I dropped to my knees in front of him, releasing the plank. The others gaped as I pummeled him with my fists. I continued with single-handed blows, one after the other. Until he lay on the ground, bloody and crying. I stopped. He cringed and whimpered beneath me, shielding his face with open palms. I could have beaten him into a helpless mass, the way he beat me all those years ago. But what would be the point? I stood to my feet. “You’re not the one I want. Just keep out of my way.” I stepped over him and marched back to Monsieur Leóne’s shop. Denue called after me, half-threatening, half-sobbing. “You freak! You’ll regret this, you scar-faced witch! You’ll regret this!” I ignored him. He was flesh and blood, like me. Beneath his savage surface, he was as frightened as the rest of us. I wanted the wolves. I returned to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and the post where I had left Crimson. He 141 snorted and stamped his feet until I released him and stroked his neck. The fire in his eye matched my own. If he had been free to fight, those boys could never have chased me. “I don’t think I’ll tie you up again, friend.” Crimson snorted. I think he understood. 142 15. Something disturbed my senses as I rode through the woods near our cottage. Something in the air. When we emerged from the forest, I understood. All of our sheep lay strewn about our meadow, turned on their sides, unmoving. A gentle breeze from our yard had carried the stench of their drying blood. I urged Crimson forward and he charged toward the house. The front door stood open, as if gaping in shock. No sheep were bleating, and a 143 glance told me that a few of them had likely run off, or been carried away. Those that remained lay in puddles of blood. Valiant lay beside them in his own scarlet stream. My crossbow was already out and loaded for our trip through the woods. I held it high as I leaped down from the saddle. In my hurry, my foot caught in the stirrup and I stumbled to the ground beside the carving table. I scrambled to my feet and ran inside. Pots and pans, clothing and half-cooked food, were scattered everywhere and stained with blood. Mama’s rocking chair lay in splintered fragments on the floor to my left. I smelled Mama’s stew bubbling in its pot on the cast-iron stove. I let it boil. Wind whistled through the house from the half-open rear door. Against the doorframe, a thick smear of blood was spread like tar. My throat went dry. On the floor beneath lay a large shred of Mama’s dress. I ran to it, clutched the fabric to my chest. I raised the crossbow high and kicked the back door open. Splotches of blood formed a trail from the rear stoop, across the grass behind the cottage, continuing toward the stable. Crimson cantered around the cottage to meet me, drawn by the noise at the back door. He noted my intensity and looked to one side, perhaps wondering what I was tracking. He sniffed at the blood and snorted, 144 sounding angry. I followed the scarlet trail to the stable entrance and hurried inside. The mess was everywhere. The walls, the posts, the hay, the troughs. All matted with thick blood. Most of it had collected in Royale’s stall. I moved toward it slowly, trembling. Within the stall, Royale’s saddle lay on its side. Strands of hay stuck to the blood that coated it. Beyond the stall, the rest of my mother’s dress lay in a sickening pile of straw and dark blood. Crimson stood back and stamped his hooves. My legs felt like melting wax as I stepped closer. I found her jewelry and one of her shoes. Nothing more. She had been taken naked, along with Papa’s horse. They had taken everything from us. Everything. Beside Mama’s abandoned dress lay a hand. A tiny skeletal hand. I fell to my knees before it. My crossbow fell to the hay. It landed on something soft and red, but it didn’t sink through the way it would have sunk into straw. I reached into the inky blood that coated the fabric and lifted it slowly. The blood clung to it and wouldn’t let go. It was her blanket. Her fuzzy woolie. I felt the moan gathering in my gut before it reached my throat and became a wail. Suzette. “Celeste! Suzette!” It was Father Vestille’s voice, calling from somewhere near the front of the cottage. I considered calling out to him from the stable. To come find my family’s remains. 145 My mouth would only whimper. Father Vestille’s feet kicked up a flurry of dust as he skidded into the stable. He gaped at me as I knelt beside Royale’s stall, next to the dress and my sister’s hand, holding her bloody blanket. He stood at the entrance beside Crimson, his chest heaving. “Helena. What – happened?” I didn’t answer. He knew what happened. Anyone seeing this would know. But just like Father Vestille, no one would admit to knowing. A wolf howled nearby. Dark rage surged through me and lifted me to my feet. I snatched up Papa’s crossbow and ran past Father Vestille. “Helena, wait!” He ran after me with Crimson trotting along behind. At the edge of the forest, barely hidden among the trees, a wolf stood. Stood. I had not imagined it. The monster stood on its hind legs, even now, and grinned. Mocking me from the woods. I lunged toward it. Father Vestille tackled me and pinned me to the ground. “Helena, no!” He held me down with his full weight, pressing me into the dirt. I strained to rise. To strike at the beast. To fire a bolt into its belly and turn that smile into a grimace of agony. I finally pushed Father Vestille off and rolled aside. I ran at the wolf as it turned to lope away. I heard it laugh as it fled – actually laugh – in a sort of whooping cackle. 146 I charged at the spot where it had stood. I squinted for a sign of its vanishing tail while Father Vestille chased after me. “Stop, Helena, stop!” Crimson galloped from behind me and clomped to a halt, blocking my path. Doing what Father Vestille could not do. Stopping me from rushing straight to my own death. Father Vestille soon reached us. Crimson snorted at me and I stood there, struggling to control my rage. To focus it. Father Vestille wheezed and bent over, his hands on his knees. He wasn’t used to sprinting. “Helena, please,” he gasped. “There’s nothing – you can do.” I stared through tree after dark tree, tracing the wolf’s likely path. “Not yet.” He hung his head. “Helena –.” “You saw it, Father. It stood.” “Stood?” he wheezed. “What, the wolf? No, Helena, no. It must have – must have simply appeared that way – from a distance.” Swallowing, he gathered his breath and straightened. “Helena. We’ll – We can clean up – your cottage. I’ll help – restore it.” He sounded as though he meant to convince himself as much as to console me. “There’s nothing to restore. They took my home. They’ve taken everything.” His eyes narrowed. “Who has taken everything?” “The wolves.” 147 He said nothing at first. He simply stood there, slowing his breathing, studying me. “Helena. You have a home. With me. I’ll stay here if you wish. Or you can come to my hovel. I’ll see to all your needs.” My breath came evenly as I watched the empty woods. The dark forest of wolves that had swallowed up Mama and Suzette. I had to stay angry to keep from screaming. “That’s very kind of you. But I’ll see to my own needs.” The wind whistled between us. “I know you can fend for yourself, Helena. But we all have needs besides food and shelter. Your father and – your mother – they were my closest friends, since before you were born. And you and Suzette …” His voice caught in his throat. “Helena, your family meant everything to me. I will not abandon you. Nor will I let you abandon yourself.” I stood like a statue before the woods. As a child, I always saw Father Vestille as a source of assurance and comfort. But there was no comfort here at the forest’s edge. I scanned its endless blackness for signs of movement. Any signs of the wolf or its companions. Nothing. I turned from it and strode to Crimson, climbing onto his back. I snapped at the reins and galloped past Father Vestille without a word. I returned to the village and rode straight to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. When I threw the 148 door open, Pierre seemed delighted to see me twice in the same day. Then his face fell. “Red? What’s wrong?” “Can I sleep here tonight?” “Of course, Red. We’ll make some room for you in the loft. What happened?” I tried to speak clearly. My voice rattled. “There was an attack. On – our cottage. Mama and Suzette – They’re gone.” The color drained from his face. “Suzette? How –? What happened?” “The wolves. They took my – The wolves took them. They’re gone. Can I sleep here tonight?” “Yes. Sure, I said you could. Just – sit over here. Did anyone else see it?” I walked to the stool he offered, brushed sawdust from it, and sat. Like a horse being led to its stable, without thought or will or emotion. “Father Vestille was there. He’s – He’s been helping out, looking in on us more often, since Papa died. He wants me to stay with him.” Pierre waited for more. “But you don’t want to. Why not?” I pressed my lips tight, feeling my blood boil again. “Red, what is it? Why are you so mad at him?” “Because he did nothing!” I burst. “Grand’Mere died and he did nothing. Francois died and he did nothing. Papa died and he couldn’t stop the wolf, couldn’t even find it. And now –!” I 149 couldn’t speak their names again. Couldn’t say again that I had lost everyone. Even Suzette. “But – he’s trying to –.” “Please, Pierre. Don’t tell me what he’s trying to do. Please don’t tell me people are trying to help, or that the King will send soldiers, or that everything will be all right, because it won’t. Nothing is going to be all right, ever again.” “Red …” I fell into his arms and clung to him. I needed someone who could understand and let me lean against him and cry. Someone who wouldn’t look down on me for my weakness or my irresponsibility or my ugliness. Someone who would let me cry, and never reveal it to anyone if I asked him. I buried my wet cheeks against his chest and sobbed in gulps, craving his comfort. He held me until I finished, then gently released me as I pulled away. He gave me a crooked smile and offered me a rag, beating some sawdust from it. I took it gratefully and wiped my eyes and nose. “This never happened.” He wrinkled his brow. “The hug?” “No. The crying.” “… Why?” “I don’t want anyone to know. And I don’t want to remember.” “Everyone cries, Red.” “I’ve cried enough. I’m through crying.” He narrowed his eyes, not sure what to make of me. “Listen, Red. I’ll let Papa know you’re here and tell him what happened. You’re 150 welcome to stay. I’ll make up the cot for you upstairs and get some blankets so you can rest.” I nodded obediently, feeling numb. As if all the emotion had been drained from my soul. At least, all the emotion I could reveal. My rage, my fear, the storm building inside me – I had to keep these reined in, lest they be fully unleashed. “Let me just add some more wood,” he said, stepping to the large center furnace and grabbing a poker to pull open its grate. A blast of light and heat emitted from within. “You sure you need more fire in there?” I asked dully. He grinned at me over his shoulder. “It’s supposed to storm tonight. Never know when you might need some extra heat.” He chucked a couple of logs into the opening, letting the mighty blaze roar at us before he shut the grate again. He lit a lantern and strode past it to the ladder at the rear of the shop. I followed him up to the loft with wooden movements. We emerged through the square opening. Pierre’s lantern lit the long-forgotten room in a dusty haze. Cobwebs connected the enormous wardrobe on the far wall to a standing mirror, covered in a dusty film. Near the shuttered window stood a cot. I longed to collapse onto it and sleep for hours, as Pierre suggested. My mind and strength were spent. He set the lantern on the nightstand and clomped to the wardrobe, his boots leaving footprints in the floorboard dust as I sneezed twice. 151 He opened the double doors, peeling cobweb strings apart, and bent to lift two thick blankets from a bottom shelf. Among the coats and dresses that hung above the blankets, something flashed a brilliant red. I stepped to the wardrobe and pushed the other garments aside. Behind coats, nightshirts and tunics, covered with dust and age, hung a long red hooded cloak. Just like the one Grand’Mere Marie made for me when I was little. The cloak I was forbidden to wear after the attack. I pulled it out. “That was Mama’s,” Pierre said. I kept staring at it. “Sorry,” I mumbled. “No, it’s all right. It’s beautiful, I know. Like the one you used to – uh, here. You should be warm enough with these.” The hood and cloak looked roomy, slightly too large for me. But they would fit. “I want this.” Pierre turned to me. “Huh? Oh. Sure, I’ll ask Papa. No one’s using it, so it shouldn’t be –.” “I want this,” I repeated. “I’ll give you anything you want for it.” “Red, you can have it. But you should get some rest.” I couldn’t take my eyes off the cloak. The red hooded cloak. I had not worn anything red since before I started hunting. Since the wolves took all peace and happiness from our lives. Now they had taken our lives, too. Grand’Mere and Francois and my parents. Even Suzette. For the first time, I had known some of the joy my mother 152 always wanted for me. To feel like a mother, or at least a big sister. And they had taken it away. I clutched the cloak to my chest. Then I moved to the cot. “I’ll use this as well. To keep warm.” “All right,” Pierre allowed. I sat on the cot. “Father Vestille will plan a service for my mother and – my sister. Can you find out the time and have someone wake me?” “Of course.” I clutched the cloak in my fist and admired it once more. “I’ll wear this to the service.” Pierre frowned. “We might have a black veil you can use. I don’t think you can wear red for a funeral.” I flashed on him. “Don’t tell me what to wear.” He studied me, then shrugged: “Red it is,” he said. “Get some sleep.” I lay down, wrapped the red cloak around myself and pulled the blankets up as Pierre returned to the ladder. I sat up. “Pierre?” His head poked up through the square opening. “Thank you,” I said. He smiled and gave a nod, then descended through the hole. I blew out the candle and the room sank into darkness. 153 16. Where are you going, little girl? I saw myself walking through the woods and tensed. The same woods I traveled as a child. I was on my way to Grand’Mere Marie’s house again, carrying a basket of bread and cheese. But I was myself, sixteen years old. I knew I was having a nightmare, but I couldn’t wake up. “Where are you going, little girl?” a gruff voice repeated from the forest. 154 I peered through black trees, thick as a fortress gate. A pair of low eyes studied me. The creature came slowly between the trunks, a thick shadow of black fur and pointed ears. Eyes shone from the shadow, a pale bluish-gray. The large wolf came into view, still lingering behind a few trees. I stepped backward, my heart racing. “Don’t be afraid,” it said. “… You’re a wolf.” The shadow nodded. It seemed to grin. “Wolves don’t talk.” I clutched the basket to my chest and took another step back. As if I could disappear within the folds of my cloak. “I do,” it said. “Where are you going, little girl?” A chilling breeze tickled my cheeks. My voice was barely a breath. “To my Grand’Mere’s house.” “And where does she live?” “… just over the hill, past the three oaks.” My eyes locked on the furry shadow as my fingers locked around the basket’s handle. “I’ve never seen a wolf like you.” “No?” Its voice was sheer mockery. I shook my head. I wanted to run, to scream. But my legs stiffened in place like a terrified fawn. The wolf stood taller than me, as it had appeared when I was only seven. Its head was half the size of my body. “You have – such big eyes. And ears. And such big teeth.” His fangs spread with pleasure. “The better to see and hear you with, Mademoiselle.” 155 I heard my breath flowing in and out. In and out. “… And your teeth?” It leaned toward me. It kept leaning in as it padded closer, closer. “The better to eat you!” I clutched the basket and raised it to protect my face. To hide my eyes from its open, dripping mouth. A sharp crack sounded over the hill. It was Grand’Mere’s neighbor, Francois, splitting wood with his ax. He would hear if I screamed. The wolf regarded me casually. “We’ll meet again, Mademoiselle. Soon. But keep silent about our first meeting.” It raised its paw to its pursed lips, as if signaling me to be quiet. The way a human would. “Now run to your Grand’Mere’s. Before she starts to worry.” The wolf turned and loped away. Beyond it, the eyes of six other wolves shone in the distance. Watching and waiting. I backed away carefully as they remained in their positions like sentinels. I hurried off through the trees. As I ran, I noticed the first wolf nearby, keeping pace with me. Its enormous black figure loped gently at first. Then it bounded through the woods, leaving me far behind. It was headed to Grand’Mere’s. I gasped and ran harder. About ten minutes later, I finally reached her cottage and threw open the door. Inside, on Grand’Mere’s bed, the wolf circled about her sheets and nightgown, smeared with her blood. It turned toward me and smiled. 156 It jumped down from the bed, padding toward me. I had rushed too far into the cottage to retreat in time. I ran behind Grand’Mere’s rocking chair to shield myself. The black wolf stood on its hind legs and knocked the chair aside like a toy. It loomed over me, eyes shining, and spread its claws. I jumped back from it. Its claws still connected, cutting into the tender flesh of my forehead and cheeks. I spun and fell back. My own blood flew about my head. Then it dripped into a scarlet pool on Grand’Mere’s wooden floor where I fell. The open wound burned like fire. I screamed but I couldn’t hear myself. Couldn’t think of anything but the wolf as it dropped to all fours. The monster prowled closer, its open mouth salivating. Something kicked open the front door. Francois Revelier burst in, carrying his ax in two fists like a hammer of judgment. He rushed at the giant wolf and raised his weapon. Its silver edge caught the sunlight from the door and flashed with blinding light. He brought the heavy blade down as the beast charged, striking its shoulder and knocking it to the floor. The wound trickled blood as the wolf struggled to rise. Then it stumbled, confused, and fell. Fell to the floor and didn’t move. Francois squinted at it, looking perplexed. The wolf’s vacant eyes no longer blinked. Francois set his jaw and stomped forward. He lopped off the monster’s head with one clean stroke. The wolf lay there in its own blood, still 157 and horrible and harmless, while Francois stood over it like David over the head of the slain Goliath. In that instant, I learned that heroes existed. People who would risk their own lives to save mine. People like Francois. Something growled from outside. At each window, the head of another large wolf eyed us. The same wolves that studied me from the forest. Francois turned as they burst through the openings. They leaped on top of him and bit into his back, his shoulders, his arms. Francois dropped his ax and screamed as he sank to his knees beneath the bloodthirsty pile. Then the head of the first wolf – the one Francois has slain – turned again to smile at me. Then – impossibly – its head slid back to its body to rejoin its neck, re-forming itself. It stood on its hind legs again and grinned at me in triumph. Then it joined the others feeding on Francois as he flailed his arms and shrieked. I jerked upright in bed and whirled about in the blackness, trying to focus. I relaxed my neck and shoulders in the dark room. On the cot in the loft above the blacksmith’s shop, where Pierre let me sleep. I was alone. No beasts or monsters. Only me and my scars. I lay back down and drew the red cloak back around myself. The cloak that belonged to Pierre’s mother, before she died. I pulled the blankets up to my shoulders and lay there on the warm cot, wide-eyed and shivering. 158 17. “Red?’ Pierre’s head popped up through the hole in the loft floor. I pulled the dress up in front of my bare shoulders and gasped. He spotted me standing in nothing but my linen chemise, before I covered myself with his mother’s cream-white gown. He immediately lowered his gaze. “Uh, sorry, Red. I just – I noticed you lit the candle and you were up, so – Just wanted to let you know Father Vestille’s 159 preparing for burial. People are already heading to the church.” “All right,” I said, still clutching the dress. “My clothes were covered in blood. I hope you don’t mind me borrowing one of your mother’s gowns.” He cleared his throat. “Yeah. Sure. No problem.” I waited. “I’m just dressing now.” “Right. Yeah. Of course. I’ll just, uh – wait down in the shop.” “Yes, you will.”",

PRAISE FOR The Red Rider Saga (from previous editions) “I got sucked in from the beginning. … I was up all night reading, imagining and feeling for this poor girl … heartbreak and twists and adventure all rolled into one. … This is a book to let a young woman read to teach about inner strength and what one young girl can do against so many odds. That one action can accomplish so much. This book gets my absolute seal of approval. I could even picture this story on the big screen! Angi Burns ~Rabid Readers Book Blog ( ( ( “Get ready to see the classic tale reimagined as you’ve never seen it before. … transforming a children’s fairy tale into a supernatural action thriller with a Zorro-style vigilante.” A.K. Preston, author of The Gevaudan Project ( ( ( “A thrilling paranormal Red Riding Hood. … a well-written retelling with a twist and a much stronger Red. … would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal thrillers or reimagined fairy tales. C.S. Wachter, author of The Sorcerer’s Bane ( ( ( 1 “Action filled novel. Journey of a teenage girl. A story of love, courage, friendship and more. The author has got it all in this book.” Jay Deb, author of The Assassin ( ( ( “[Randall]’s unauthorized sequel to Little Red Riding Hood blends great characters with a compelling storyline and places it in the middle of a legendary premisè… a well-told story about seeking justice rather than revenge and finding a way to properly overcome evil. What I liked best about this tale was that this little girl was a flawed character—and she seemed to have all rights to believe the way she believed and think the way she thinks—but [Randall] is careful not to glorify the fact she wants revenge. In fact, the story is about Red learning through her quest to destroy the wolves that revenge will, in fact, destroy herself. It’s a big concept and [Randall] does it well.” Josh Olds, Life is Story ( ( ( “There are stories with great writing styles. Those that have amazing plots. Those that sustain your attention with every word. Ones that exceed your expectations of great lines, with a satisfying ending. Mr. [Randall] accomplished all of these aspects. I can only hope that the right person will come across The Red Rider and turn it into a movie that is sure to be a box-office hit.” Kym McNabney, Story Contributor, Childhood Regained: Stories of Hope for Asian Child Workers by Jodie Renner and Steve Hooley 2 WHAT READERS ARE SAYING (from previous editions) “Full of thrilling discoveries and heart-pounding adventure! Helena “Red” is as complex, driven, and bold as Katniss Everdeen (Hunger Games). You will be cheering for her from the start!” ( ( ( “This book was fantastic!!!!!!! Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. A fantastic twist on the original Red Riding Hood. Helena is my hero.” ( ( ( “Fantastic, suspenseful retelling of Red Riding Hood. A story of wolves and black magic. How the beautiful, innocent child Helena, becomes the physically scarred, determined, skillful hunter of wolves. How the stuff of nightmares becomes reality for a whole community, and a young woman's strength and overwhelming desire to completely destroy the terror that haunts her dreams and waking moments. Powerful imagery, wonderful storytelling. I thoroughly recommend it.” ( ( ( “Definitely not what I expected. There were plenty of twists and turns packed into this book. A good read for any fairytale/fantasy lover.” ( ( ( “While the story takes place in France a long time ago, it has a contemporary feel to it, and the story moves quickly. You find yourself rooting for the main character. I'll certainly buy the next [D.A. Randall] novel if it's as good as this one.” ( ( ( 3 “The Red Rider is a well written book full of adventure, mystery, twists and turns with a fair amount of moral teachings included. This is a book that would be excellent for young teens and adults alike.” ( ( ( “If you enjoyed Little Red Riding Hood as a child, you will love this book. It has mystery, adventure, and suspense. Once you start to read it you won't be able to stop until you finish it. This is the first time I have read anything by this author but he has found a fan of his writings. He is an amazing storyteller.” ( ( ( “Imagine Little Red Riding Hood being scarred by her traumatic encounter with the big bad wolf, and imagine that the big bad wolf ‘isn't a wolf.’ Then let her grow into an angry teenager, give her a red cape, a reloading crossbow and a grappling hook, and gallop with her on her one-supergirl-war against a coven of big bad wolves. The Red Rider is a teen action-fantasy hero and that is how the novel reads. No spoilers here: The suspense with author [D.A. Randall] is just how dark this fantasy will turn, as he takes the white-washed premise of the Brothers Grimm and gets much, much grimmer. A great fit with the grown-up fairy-tale versions of recent years that has emerged in print and film. I recommend it with pleasure. ( ( ( 4 5 RED RIDER RISING by D.A.

RANDALL NEWSLETTER RANDALL ALLEN DUNN ACTION THRILLERS 11 MY SCARS 12 13 1. I never meant to become this. The lazy breeze made my red hooded cloak waft about my shoulders as I sat atop my horse, my cheeks warmed by the consuming blaze. The same gentle wind lifted the roaring flames higher and higher, racing through every inch of the building. I could do nothing to silence the screams of the men inside as they shouted my name. The name they had given me. “Rider! Rider!” Nothing to change what I had become. 14 It was not entirely my choice. I had not started this war, nor had I planned to become a sixteen-year old warrior. I started out as a little girl, innocent as any other. Enjoying life, enjoying my family, anticipating a happy future. Until they had disrupted my entire world, nearly a decade ago … “Hit her again, harder!” Egged on by his friends, Jacque Denue had smiled and rammed his fist into my gut. The jarring pain had shaken my prone body, making me want to vomit. I held back the bile, since the other four boys had me pinned and I didn’t want to swallow it back down my throat. At least the early morning rain had muddied the ground enough for me to sink into it, while it ruined my little dress and burlap cloak. When would Papa come back with the wagon? I was too hoarse to scream any more. I could only raise an arm or a leg as much as they let me, curling into a weak ball to protect myself. The village boys laughed as they took turns punching at my stomach, chest, arms, groin and face. My horrible, scarred face that helped them justify their attack. “You sick, ugly witch!” Jacque spat. “You stay out of La Rue Sauvage, you hear? Stay out of our village!” His palm weaved around my arms and slapped me. Tiny lights swirled about my face as 15 the sting settled into my cheek. I wanted to sleep. To sleep forever and make them go away. “Monster!” one boy yelled. “Disgusting hag!” shouted another. I stopped trying to rise from beneath them. I shut my eyes, accepting blow after blow, my arms and legs burning with bruises. I no longer saw them. I saw myself and the image they so hated. The seven-year old girl with blonde hair and blue eyes and three thick scars slashed across her face. They ran at a slant, like torn pink ribbons. The top one started above my left eye and ended below my right. The second ran below my left eye and scraped across my distorted nose. The last tore across my left cheek and my mouth, ending beneath the enlarged right portion of my lower lip. No wonder they called me a monster. My mind pictured something else as they kept hammering my stomach. I saw the wolf, large and leering and unstoppable, its jaws opening wide to swallow me. The wolf that stood on its hind legs and loomed over me. The living nightmare that spoke to me through its grinning fangs: Where are you going, little girl? I found my voice and screamed. “Helena!” “Run!” the boys shouted. The pain stopped – or at least, stopped mounting - replaced by a scuttling and sloshing of feet through mud puddles and fallen leaves. “Helena! What have you boys done? Come back here, you!” 16 I kept my eyes shut and lay still, sobbing but relieved. Papa would stop them. He would chase them, punish them, his blue eyes blazing with rage above his thick black moustache. He would catch every last one of them and make them sorry for hitting me. Strong arms surrounded me. They snatched me up, then slowed to cradle me. “Helena.” Papa’s voice broke. “Helena.” “Papa,” I rasped, too weak to hug him. I winced out tears as he held me, keeping my eyes closed, until I could breathe regularly again. “Did you get them?” His chest sighed. “They ran away.” “All of them? You didn’t catch any?” My voice croaked like a frog’s. “Helena, I’m taking you to Doctor Renoire.” He rushed me to the next street where we had left our wagon. I had wandered off to smell some flowers outside another shop, when the boys started hurling insults and chased me through the alley. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa cradled me closer as he sloshed across the muddy path. My burlap cloak scraped against my bare shoulders where my dress had been torn. “I’m taking you to the doctor,” he said. “Am I dying?” “No, Helena. You’re not dying.” “After we’re done – I want to see him.” “I’ll think on it. Lie still.” He laid me down on the hay in the bed of our wagon, pushing aside the pumpkins and squash 17 he had purchased to make room. I heard Papa’s horse, Royale, snort his readiness from the front. Soon we were rolling and jostling along the dusty road, so much smoother than the hills outside our distant cottage. So smooth … And I was so scarred. 18 2. I still felt pain, stinging my stomach and face and between my legs, as I lay on the cot in the visiting room. But Doctor Renoire had cleaned me with soft cloths and lotion that took away most of the soreness. Soonafter, I had been able to sit up and eat some of the crackers he kept in his house. He and Papa had left me alone to rest. I laid there as I had been told. Until I heard them talking out in the parlor. I slid down from the cot, wincing at new aches knifing into my thighs and lower back. My 19 ripped, muddy dress had been thrown away. I now wore a pair of boy’s trousers and a shirt, which Doctor Renoire had borrowed from his son’s wardrobe. Only one item had been rescued, and lay on the table beside the cot. My burlap cloak. At least the dark bloodstain in the center gave it some color. I pulled it about my shoulders and hobbled to the door, the wooden floor chilling my bare feet. I peered through the crack and listened. Papa leaned forward in a chair, burying his face in his hands. Doctor Renoire kept a hand on his shoulder. “Relax, Henri,” he said. “Helena’s going to be all right.” Papa sat up and wiped away tears. “This is why. This is why we don’t come out any more. Why we can’t.” “Because of her face?” “No. Not exactly. I just don’t want her suffering any more harm.” My cloak scraped my bruised forearm as I draped it tighter about myself. Doctor Renoire stared at the floorboards. “When Father Vestille brought her in last spring – I had never seen anything like it. At least, not anyone who survived. And certainly no child.” My breath grew quick and shallow. My skin bristled at the memories that still filled my nightmares. The wolf that spoke to me in the forest, that killed Grand’Mere Marie and tried to kill me. The wolf that was anything but a wolf. 20 Doctor Renoire knelt before my father. “Perhaps it’s distasteful to say, but you really should be so grateful, Henri. Just grateful to have her.” “I know. We are. That’s why we can’t let her go out. Not until we can know this won’t happen again.” My foot shuffled against the floor. They both turned. I opened the door slowly as if I had just arrived. Papa quickly wiped his face. “Helena. How do you feel?” “A little better.” “Come here, Helena,” Doctor Renoire beckoned, still kneeling. I limped toward him, feeling some of my strength returning. “That’s it. Good girl. You’re walking fine. You just need to rest up for a few days. Your father agreed to let you skip some chores the next few weeks while you recover. But you should be up and around in no time. Nothing seems to be broken and you’re already moving around much better.” They smiled. They seemed to be waiting for me to respond in kind, so I smiled back. “You know, Helena,” Doctor Renoire continued. “I’ve never seen a girl recover so quickly. You survived six months ago and again today. You’re fortunate to be alive, both times. You’re a true miracle.” My smile faded. “I don’t feel like a miracle.” 21 I clutched at my sore ribs as we trudged through the leaves littering the cobblestone street. I was eager to barter for a new dress at the village clothier and return the trousers that felt so strange, clinging to my legs and exposing them in public. We rarely visited the brick shops and stone houses of La Rue Sauvage. It seemed aptly named now: “Wild Street”. I had begged Papa to take me with him today, but he would never allow it again. Perhaps my parents were right to keep me close to home, never venturing too far outside. Where the wolf might be waiting. “I want to see Francois,” I said. Papa said nothing at first. “You need to rest. We came to the village. That should be enough excitement for one day, don’t you think?” I heard laughter and flinched. A few men strolled by in front of us, chuckling. Not Jacque Denue or his friends. “I want to see Francois. Please, Papa.” He sighed. “I’ll think on it. Let’s focus on finding a new dress.” We arrived at the clothier and stepped up onto its stoop. The store sign suddenly flipped over to show it now closed as the front door slammed. Papa held my hand and stood in the empty street, staring at the shop door. The sign above the door read: Clothier de Denue. I never knew Jacque’s father sold clothes. He must have heard about what happened. Now he wouldn’t speak to us, out of shame. Or fear. Papa’s hand tightened on mine. His moustache twitched as he clenched his jaw, before 22 he turned me away from the closed door. “Come on, Helena.” I glanced back at the shop. An eye peered out from a crack in the window shutter. Then it disappeared. “We’re not getting a dress?” “Your mother can make you a quick one, perhaps by tomorrow. We’ll ask Doctor Renoire to let us keep these clothes another week. We’re going to see Francois.” My heart soared. “Oh, thank you, Papa!” I nearly threw my arms around him. Then I slowed myself to hug him without upsetting the pain in my ribs. He knew I needed to visit Francois, especially today. Sometimes Francois was the only person who could make me feel safe. Especially when I remembered the wolf. Papa marched to the wagon without a word. He studied the noonday sun. He never let me travel all the way from La Rue Sauvage to Francois’ cabin this late in the day, for fear of being out after dark. He never felt anything was worth that risk. We had to hurry. I tightened my burlap cloak against a draft, scraping my bruises. I glanced back at the shop to see the eye staring at me again before it vanished. Jacque Denue’s father was smart to stay hidden. Papa was no coward. But why didn’t he even knock on the door when we both knew Monsieur Denue was there? Why didn’t he kick the door open and make him give me a new dress for the way his son treated me? Why wouldn’t anyone help me? 23 3. As our wagon rolled up the muddy path to his cabin, I spotted Francois chopping wood outside and smiled. I loved watching his strong arms hammer down on a log with his silver ax. He was a burly man with a round belly and a scraggly beard that crinkled up in a grin whenever he saw me. A wave of warm sunshine bathed me from inside. For the first time since I saw him last month, I felt as though nothing could harm me. Papa tugged Royale to a stop. I wanted to scramble down from the wagon without waiting 24 for permission. But the pain in my side and my legs nearly slowed me to a halt. “Easy, Helena,” Papa said. I hobbled over to Francois as fast as I could, ready for him to scoop me up into his broad arms like always. He thumped his ax into the wood and hurried to me with a fat smile. “Well, well, Helena! What brings you all the way out here?” he boomed. He frowned upon seeing me limp and the pants I now wore. “What happened?” I started to tell him, but I couldn’t. I fell against him and wept, letting my itchy cloak fall to the mud. He hoisted me into the air, but didn’t swing me around in a big circle. Instead, he cradled me like a bear holding a tiny cub. I nuzzled against his warm chest, covered with wooden chips and dust. He patted my back and hugged me. With his heavy arms, who needed a cloak? “It’s all right, Mademoiselle. It’s all right.” “Some boys in the village,” I blubbered. “They chased me and hit me and wouldn’t stop.” “Andre Denue’s son and some of his friends,” Papa said, striding up from behind. “He wouldn’t even open his door to let us buy a new dress. These are from Doctor Renoire’s son.” I sniffed and swiped a tear from my cheek, brushing one of my triple scars. “They called me a monster.” Francois’ hands clenched against my back, then relaxed. “You’re no monster. You just had some bad luck, that’s all. Don’t pay no attention to 25 those morons. Sounds to me like a bunch of no-good bullies.” “I wish you’d been there. Papa let them get away.” Francois held me a moment longer. Then he gently set me down and knelt before me. His eyes looked worried. “Now listen, Helena. If I’d been there, I couldn’t have done anything more than what your father did.” I glanced back to see Papa staring at the ground. I started to tremble. I never meant to dishonor him. I just wanted someone to protect me. Francois’ large finger turned my chin back toward him. “I’m betting your father took you straight to the doctor, didn’t he? And you’re here in one piece. Aren’t you? I expect he was more concerned about treating your wounds than getting revenge.” My face screwed up with tears again. I fell against Francois and sobbed. Ashamed of the way I had spoken about Papa. Angry at Jacque Denue and his friends for nearly beating me to death. And terrified of facing them – or anyone – again. Afraid of showing my horrid face. “Helena. Your cloak,” Papa said. I turned. He held the burlap cloak out to me. I took it with a faint smile, then draped it back in place, careful to keep it from scraping my shoulders too much. Francois patted my back. “Dry your tears now. I’m glad you came today. Been wanting to 26 show you something, next time I saw you. Come on back.” He wiped my eyes with the tail of his thick tunic. I smeared away the rest with the back of my fist. He led me like a lamb, his large hand around my shoulder, toward the rear of his stable. I smiled, eager to see Francois’ ebony horse, Lightning, named for the jagged stripe that covered her nose. I always felt better after petting her. As we came around the corner, Lightning lifted her head lazily. A colt jerked its head from beneath her. It rose to face us, stamping its hooves in protest. Its flanks were red like flame. I gaped. “What’s that?” “That,” he said, “is our new colt.” Its blazing eyes locked on mine. “She’s red!” I squealed. My cloak fell off my shoulders again as I hobbled forward. “Whoa! Stop!” Francois shouted as Papa also yelled behind him. I limped to the gate as fast as I could. The fiery colt reared back, then ran at me. “Helena!” Papa cried. Francois tugged me back as the colt stamped and kicked at the gate. “Easy now, that colt’s a wild one. Understand? Don’t move too quick around it, you’ll pay for it.” I stared into the colt’s eyes. It did look dangerous, but that seemed all right somehow. It didn’t seem mean, just frightened and ready to fight. The same way I felt, except I didn’t have 27 hooves to kick against a gate. “Let me give her some oats.” “Helena …” Papa started. “I don’t know, Helena,” Francois said. “It’s still a little fired up.” “I can do it. I’ll be careful.” After a silent moment, Papa nodded to Francois. “All right, if you walk up with her.” Francois led me to the feed bag hanging outside the stable. He dug out a handful of oats and emptied some into my hand. “Now you let me go first,” he said. We stepped toward the colt, slow and steady. It watched our every move, looking curious, as I hobbled forward with a smile. Francois opened his hand and extended it beneath the colt’s mouth. The colt snorted and tossed its head. Then it bent, sniffed, and nibbled like one of Papa’s sheep. “See, she’s sweet,” I said. I lifted my open palm with my oats, careful not to startle the colt. It stared at me for several seconds. Then it nibbled from my hand. It tickled. When all the oats were gone, it buried his nose in my hand and nuzzled. I took a step closer, moving slow and gentle. It gave a low snort from somewhere in its belly, as a warning. I smiled and took another small step. It let me edge closer. Then I gently curved my hand around to stroke its jaw, and it relaxed. It took a half-step closer and bent its head to let me pet it. I laid my head against the colt and hugged it with both arms. “She likes me.” “Would you look at that?” Francois said, sounding surprised. “But ‘she’ is a ‘he’.” 28 “How do you know?” “Just trust me, all right? So. Now you’ve got him settled, what do you think we should name him?” My eyes lit up. “Crimson. His whole flank is crimson like fire.” It was my favorite word for red. Papa’s face wrinkled at that as he held my burlap cloak. Though he looked more pained than offended. “Then ‘Crimson’ it is,” Francois said, petting the colt as he grew calmer. “And you can help me take care of him.” I looked up at him. “I can? You mean it?” “You come out as often as you like, Helena. When you’re older, I’ll teach you to ride him.” My heart raced. Women rode in carriages, not on horses, and I had never heard of a girl learning how to ride. I leaned against him and threw my arms around his belly, squeezing him tight. “Thank you. Thank you, Francois.” He turned toward Papa, licking his lips. “If it’s all right with your father, that is.” I looked back. “Can I, Papa?” Papa looked pale. He wrung the burlap cloak in his hands. “We’ll see. When you’re a little older.” I hobbled to Papa and fell onto him in a tight hug. I limped back to Crimson, who continued to study my awkward movements, and petted him again. He leaned his head down and 29 stared at me as though we could see into one another’s souls. 30 4. Crimson lifted his head and snorted. I released him as another horse whinnied in the distance. I hobbled toward Papa to peer around the corner of Francois’ stable. A beautiful black coach was rolling across the muddy path to the cabin. Papa’s voice rose. “Were you expecting Duke Laurent?” Francois arrived behind us. “Last person I’d be expecting out here. ‘Course, I didn’t expect to see you today, either.” 31 Duke Laurent ruled the province, but he and Papa had become good friends. He always gave me the most delicious apples and pears whenever he visited Papa. He made me feel almost as safe as Francois. As the adorned coach drew closer, I spotted a gray Palomino trotting behind it amidst the falling leaves. I smiled, recognizing the black cloak and hat of its rider. “Or Father Vestille?” Papa asked. Francois craned his neck forward and gaped. “Next to last person I’d expect. Unless he’s short on confessions. I’m sure I could fill his plate, if he’s feeling lonely.” Papa lowered his chin. “Show respect, Francois.” Francois raised his hands. “Sorry.” Father Vestille didn’t always make me feel safe, but he always smiled and bent down to listen to me after the Sunday Mass. When I was little, he let me sit on his lap whenever he came to visit us. Every time I talked with him, I completely forgot about my scars. The royal coach arrived first. I watched closely as the driver stepped down from his perch to open the rear door. I always felt proud knowing Papa was friends with the Duke of La Rue Sauvage himself. Duke Laurent jumped down and nodded his thanks to the driver, then gaped at us with wide eyes. He ran to Papa, ignoring the mud that splattered on the fine wool-lined coat Mama had made for him. “Henri, are you both all right? I 32 heard there was some trouble in the village. Doctor Renoire said you went home, but we saw the tracks leading here.” Papa shook his hand. “She’s all right. Doctor Renoire said she just needs to rest.” Duke Laurent regarded me with pitiful golden-brown eyes, which made him look even more handsome. He knelt before me, kissing both my hands as if I was a princess. “Helena. I’m so glad you’re all right.” “I am. It still hurts, though.” “I’m sure it does. But you’ll get well. Just rest, like your father says, and you’ll be up and about in no time.” “Monsieur,” Papa said. “May I introduce Francois Revelier?” The Duke stood as Papa and Francois bowed their heads. “The man who saved Helena last year?” He took a step back to view Francois’ full height and size. “Such bravery should not go unnoticed. If I were back at the court in Versailles, you would receive a medal for protecting one of our precious citizens. I can’t provide that, but I believe a banquet in your honor is long overdue.” My heart leaped as Francois gaped at him. “Well, uh – thank you. Your Majesty. Er, Your Grace.” The Duke smiled. “You may call me ‘Monsieur’. Or ‘Leopold’, if you prefer.” Francois shook his hand. “Think it’ll have to be ‘Monsieur’. Wouldn’t feel right using the first name of royalty.” 33 “I’m not all that royal anymore,” Duke Laurent joked. “Any news from the King?” Papa asked. The Duke’s face fell. He glanced down at me, then back at Papa, spreading his hands. “He still refuses to answer my letters. I’ve tried, Henri. I can implore him to send some men, but – .” “I know,” Papa said. “You have no authority with Versailles.” Duke Laurent shrugged and shook his head. “The perils of losing favor with the royal court. I’m fortunate to be given oversight here. I only wish I could provide better security for --.” He glanced down at me and stopped himself. “… for our province.” Papa heaved a sigh. “We need soldiers, Monsieur Laurent. There must be someone we can appeal to. Someone to make the King see reason.” “I’m afraid the only one who can change the mind of the King toward me and our province is the King. I’ve asked. I’ve pleaded. I’ve begged.” His eyes burrowed into the ground. “I don’t even know whether they open my appeals or if they immediately discard them upon seeing my name.” Papa whirled away with clenched fists. He unclenched them quickly as Father Vestille strode toward us, the sun glinting off of his bald head. “Abier, how are you?” Papa said, shaking hands. “You know Francois, of course.” Father Vestille nodded to Francois. “Of course.” Francois smiled, with less than his usual warmth. “Well, we’re not on a first name basis.” 34 “Perhaps we should be,” Father Vestille said. “I haven’t even spoken to you since --. Well, since Spring.” He glanced at me the same way Duke Laurent had. As if I didn’t remember what Francois did for me this past spring. He knelt before me with open arms. I hugged him tight. “What are you doing here?” “I heard there was a commotion in the village. I came to see you.” He lowered his chin, his forehead creasing with worry. “Are you all right?” I nodded, feeling better. Safer, even. “I saw you weren’t at home, so I followed the tracks here. I told Celeste I would find you both. I, ah –.” He raised his eyebrows at Papa. “I didn’t tell her anything else. Figured you’d want to share that.” Papa nodded. “Thank you.” “Did you hear what happened?” I asked. “Doctor Renoire found me and told me about it. I’ll have a talk with Andre Denue tomorrow, see if I can find out who the other boys were,” he said, more to Papa than to me. “Are you going to excommunicate Monsieur Denue?” I asked, hopeful. “Or Jacque?” Father Vestille blinked. “I don’t think I’ll need to do that, Helena. I would rather give them both a chance to make amends.” “But they beat me. And they wouldn’t stop. You have to do something.” 35 “I will. I plan to talk to every one of them about what they’ve done. And help them understand the wrong of it.” I shook my head. “That won’t help. You need to punish them, to make sure they can’t do it again. You have to hurt them the way they hurt me. You should –!” “Helena,” Papa interrupted with a scowl. “That’s enough.” “Yes, leave the punishments to me, Helena,” Duke Laurent broke in. “After all, maintaining order is the role of government. Not the church.” Father Vestille looked sideways at the Duke and frowned. “Yes, that is true. Tell me, what is being done about these occasional – attacks?” “All that the King will allow, which isn’t much, I’m afraid. As far as France is concerned, we’re on our own.” Father Vestille wrinkled his brow. “So the King plans to let La Rue Sauvage fend for itself? He refuses to lift a finger to help us?” “Your words, not mine, Father,” Duke Laurent replied. Father Vestille stepped toward him, looking annoyed, as Papa moved between them. I fidgeted, eager to avoid their argument. “I want to see Crimson again,” I told Francois. “Sure thing,” Francois boomed. “Right this way. We’ll let these gentlemen continue their civil conversation on their own.” He cast an amused 36 glance over his shoulder, and I saw Papa sour at him as we trudged to the rear of the stable. Crimson stood by the gate and lifted his head as we returned, still focused on me. I limped back to the feed bag to give him some more oats. “It’s all right, Crimson. Just Papa talking with Duke Laurent and Father Vestille. Nothing to be afraid of.” I watched the oats disappear from my hand as he nibbled. My sides still ached, but I felt numb inside. Numb and helpless, with no one to protect me from Jacque Denue and his friends. Or from anything else. “Francois? How often do you get scared?” “I dunno. Now and then. Everybody gets scared sometimes.” I stroked Crimson’s flank. “I feel like I’m scared all the time.” He didn’t answer right away. “What’re you scared of?” “That the wolf might come back.” He shuffled his feet in the grass. “Hard to come back if he’s dead.” I pictured its horrible image again. Its monstrous head. Its jagged ears. Its fanged smile. “I heard there were other attacks. Didn’t the wolf kill some other people, too?” Francois paced to one side, then back toward me. “That was before. Figure it was that same wolf. Sure, there have been other attacks, by wolves or some other animals. But you don’t need to worry about that big, bad wolf anymore. He’s gone forever.” 37 “Were you scared when you killed him?” “‘Course I was. But sometimes there are things more important than being scared. Things you’ve got to stand up and fight for.” “Like trying to save Grand’Mere?” “Yeah. And looking after you. I mean, if I hadn’t gone in after that wolf – well, he would’ve gotten you, too. Can’t let being scared stop you from doing what’s right. If everybody stays scared, who’s gonna protect us?” I knew he was right. But the wolf was monstrous. And I was just a girl that older boys beat on. “Francois. Can you teach me to fight?” His eyes bulged. “Uhhh, now why would you want to learn that, Helena?” I cocked my head at him. “You know why. So I can beat up Jacque Denue instead of him beating on me.” He frowned. “I’m not sure that’s the answer to your problem, Helena. Certainly not the answer your father would give you.” “That’s why I’m asking you. You know how to stand up and fight. You knew how to kill that wolf.” He scratched his beard. “Yeah, well. Funny thing, that whole business. I didn’t strike it that hard, you know? I just got lucky. That big old wolf must have been tired or sick or something, because I barely grazed it. It died a few seconds after I struck it.” I blinked. “I thought you chopped its head off.” 38 “That was after he died. Didn’t want to take any chances with a wolf that big. But – well, anyway. Fighting’s not the answer. Not for a young girl like you.” “So I just have to get beat up?” He pressed his lips tight, then sighed heavily at the ground. He crouched beside me, his voice dropping to a low whisper. “All right, come here. Look. The thing about any fight is, not so much getting in your licks at the other guy, as making sure he doesn’t get anything on you.” I squinted. “Huh?” “I mean, don’t tire yourself out. If he swings at you with his right, you step aside and let him miss. When he swings again, you step back or to the side again. Sooner or later, he’ll tire himself out trying to hit you.” “And then you flatten him,” I said, excited. He half-smiled. “Well, yeah. But the same thing. Don’t tire yourself out. Look, you’re a girl. Boys are gonna be stronger than you most of the time, right? So don’t just use your fists.” He leaned toward the corner of the stable and listened to make sure the others were still talking. Then he crouched and spoke even softer. “Grab a stick. Or a brick. Or a rock. Or anything you can use to lay him flat.” My stomach churned at the thought of a brick smashing into Jacque Denue’s face. “I don’t want to kill him.” “Then don’t hit him where you’ll kill him. Just hit him hard enough in the knee or the gut that he won’t think of bothering you again. All right?” 39 I nodded, satisfied. “All right.” “And, uh – .” He glanced back to the side again. “Don’t tell your father we had this talk. Think it’s better that way.” I smiled. “Me, too.” He nodded, pressing his hands on his knees to rise. Then he bent back down. “Listen, Helena. If you ever run into trouble – real trouble – and I’m not around, I want you to look up a friend of mine in the village. Name’s Gerard Touraine. He’ll look after you.” I nodded. “Gerard Touraine. All right.” He glanced back at the corner of the stable. We heard Papa still talking with the others. “All right, let me show you how to look after yourself.” He stood a little, his hands on his knees as he bent over me. He made a fist. “If someone comes at you like this, see, you step sideways out of the way. That’s it. Hey, even hobbling around, it’s easier to move without a dress, ain’t it? Now while he’s swinging hard and hitting air, he’s off-balance. See that? See how I’m ready to fall forward? So you knuckle both your fists together and swing hard on his back to carry him the rest of the way. He’ll plant his face in the mud. Or he’ll double over and you can bring your knee up hard to his jaw. Got me? But you gotta know how to keep from getting hit first, so you can use his own strength against him. Then you just knock him over or punch him in his ribs, hard. That’ll take the wind out of him. Strike hard and fast. The faster you finish it, the less likely he’ll be to mess with you again.” He glanced up as Papa returned, and straightened to 40 his full height. “– and that’s why you should never fight with boys. That’s what I say. So just stay away from those bullies.” He gave a firm nod. Papa smiled at him. “Duke Laurent and Father Vestille have gone home, now that they know you’re safe. Don’t think they see eye-to-eye on many subjects. Helena, it’ll be dark in a few hours. Are you ready to go home?” I smiled at Francois, feeling a new sense of confidence. “Yes. I’m ready.” Francois Revelier had taught me how to fight. I had new hope. 41 5. It was near dark when we pulled up to our cottage. Only a couple of the sheep lay awake bleating in their pen while the rest slept. Papa had driven Royale faster up the path when the air chilled and the sun dipped toward the horizon. The mud had dried, making the ride faster if not smoother. Mama strode onto the front porch to greet us, her hands twisting around a cloth towel as if it needed to be wrung. She looked pale and her eyes 42 were larger than usual. “Henri. You’re so late. What on earth happened?” “Everything’s all right, Celeste,” he promised. “Had an incident in town. Then we went to see Francois.” She squinted through the darkness to see me. To see my face. Her eyes bulged. “Dear –! Come inside. What happened? Did something –? … Come in here and let me clean you up. Henri, tell me what happened.” I hobbled over the hard ground to Mama. She held me against her as we moved indoors. She led me straight through the front kitchen and off to my room at the back of the house, then helped me lay down on my bed. It felt good to finally rest. Though I dreaded sleep, especially after today. She unlaced my shoes, caked with dry mud, and pulled them off as Papa came in. “Some boys in the village beat her. I took her to Doctor Renoire. He loaned us his son’s clothes for a while, ‘til next time we return to the village.” “Well, you’ll go alone next time. She’s not going back to that village.” Her voice and face grew tight. “I know. Never should’ve agreed to take her in the first place.” “Yes, you should,” I said. “I can’t stay inside forever, Papa. Sooner or later, I’ve got to stand up.” “Hush now,” Mama said, stroking my forehead. “Henri, get a basin of water.” 43 Papa left without a word. “I have to stand up, Mama,” I repeated. “You need to lie down.” “No. I have to stand up to them. I have to fight.” “Hush. Just keep far away from those boys.” I stared at her, marveling at her perfect appearance and poise. Her auburn hair up in a beautiful bun with ringlets dangling about her ears. Her homespun dress – she was an amazing seamstress – rising from her shoulders in shapely curves, its intricate pattern decorating her slim arms and wrists. Her face peaceful and soft, even when flushed with anger. “Mama? Am I a monster?” Her eyes flared. “What on earth would make you think that?” “That’s what those boys said. That’s why they beat me. Because I’m so ugly.” She gaped at me as if I had burned down our cottage. “If that’s why they beat you, it’s those boys who are ugly monsters.” A tear slid around my cheek as I admired her features. “I wish I were pretty like you.” She nearly lunged at me, scooping me into her tight embrace. Papa hurried in with the water basin, but slowed and set it down gently when he saw us hugging. “Helena, you are pretty,” Mama said. “Not to boys, I’m not.” “You don’t need to worry about boys just now. You’re a beautiful girl. And you have a 44 beautiful heart. Someday, when you’re much older, you’ll meet a boy who sees that.” Papa glanced sharply at us. Then he focused on soaking a rag in the water. He didn’t like for me to talk about boys at all, even with Mama. “The boys in town think I’m a monster. Except for Pierre.” Mama trembled against me. “Well, he’s a nice boy, at least. You can forget about the others. Now let’s get you cleaned up.” Papa slid the basin closer and Mama helped me remove the boy’s tunic and trousers. She cleaned every bruise and cut, put fresh bandages over a few of them, then dried me off and helped me dress in my nightgown. “Say your prayers,” she said. I knelt carefully beside my bed as they stood watch. My back and side and one knee still ached horribly. I made the sign of the cross over myself and folded my blistered hands. “Dear Lord, please bless and secure our home. Protect us and lead us. Bless our province. Bless Francois and Father Vestille and Duke Laurent, and help the King see that we need help. Heal me and help me sleep through the night. Amen.” I rose slowly, pulled back the covers and climbed into bed. Papa hung his head and tightened his fists as Mama kissed my forehead. “I love you, Helena,” she said, her voice strained. “Sweet dreams.” They stepped out and shut the door, encasing me in blackness. 45 Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares. I wandered through the flowery meadow outside our home and on into the dark canopy of the woods. My little basket swung at my side. I smiled at the red hooded cloak surrounding me, the one Grand’Mere had made, warding off the early morning chill. My cheeks were rosy and free of scars. I listened close in the darkness of the pine trees, shuddering. Within the whistling wind, I could hear its voice. Where are you going, little girl? I started to run. Through the woods, past shrubs and towering trees and scurrying animals. The forest grew denser, until I felt it might close in on me. I scoured every direction for the source of the growling voice but saw nothing. So nice to see you again, little girl. My heart pounded. I ran faster. I stumbled, but rose to my feet and raced on. The voice grew louder. I can see you, little Helena. I’m coming after you … I emerged from the woods, from the heavy strangle of trees, into the broad meadow outside Grand’Mere Marie’s cottage. I had to warn her. I ran to her door and pounded on it, stealing glances over my shoulder. The woods remained still and quiet, but the voice persisted from somewhere. Helena. I’m coming for you … 46 I heard snoring. At the neighboring cottage, the window shutter hung open. I could see Francois’ large frame, asleep on his cot, his giant belly rising and falling. Ah, there you are, Helena. I spun around. In a stream of fog at the edge of the dark forest, the black wolf stood tall, its blue-gray eyes shining brightly. I twisted the doorknob and ran inside. I slammed the door shut with both hands, then swung the bolt down to lock it. I turned to find Grand’Mere. There on her bed, something shuffled in the sheets. The black wolf had already gotten inside somehow, circling among Grand’Mere’s nightgown and cap, now soaked in blood. I gasped and fell against the door. The beast fixed its ghostly eyes on me. Its voice rasped low and cruel. “Come in, little girl. Come see your Grand’Mere.” The same wolf that had padded close to me in the woods, keeping its distance but calling out until I answered. Until I told it I was going to my Grand’Mere’s house, and to leave me alone. Instead, it had raced ahead to devour her. The wolf jumped down from the bloody bed and padded across the cherrywood floor toward me. It stood – stood – on its hind legs, grinning. I hurled my basket at its face. It scraped the beast’s nose and bounced off. The wolf arched its eyebrows, its blue-gray eyes widening. It lifted its paw, extending sharp claws, then swiped at me as I screamed. 47 Everything fell black. My skin felt clammy, my nightgown drenched with sweat. I sat straight up in bed, feeling the soreness in my back as I stared into the pitch darkness. Something stomped hard across the floorboards. Then a faint light peeked beneath my door. Mama came in. Papa followed her, bearing a lantern. Mama rushed to my side and cradled me. “Helena, you’re all right. It’s just a bad dream.” I clung to her, feeling numb. I stared at Papa’s lantern, the only source of light. “It spoke again,” I said. “Hush, Helena,” she told me. “It was just a bad dream. Wolves can’t speak.” I let her rock me back and forth, back and forth. They never believed me, any more than Father Vestille or Francois had when they brought me to Doctor Renoire. They assumed I was hysterical and babbling in my delirium. I closed my eyes to shut out the nightmare. But my mind saw the wolf’s leering grin. Heard its guttural voice. “Where’s my cloak?” I asked. They said nothing. I opened my eyes. Papa straightened, his posture rigid. “It’s put away.” “Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. It’s mine.” In the pale light of his high lantern, Papa’s dark moustache formed a thick frown. “Your burlap cloak will keep you warm enough. And it won’t attract attention.” 48 A wolf howled in the distance. My body tensed in a spasm as Mama tightened her hold. Papa rushed to the shuttered window. He stood there, his back to me. For a moment, I thought he would throw open the shutter, to see if the wolf was lurking right outside. I expected him to leap through the window in one bound, race into the forest, find the wolf, and strangle it with his bare hands. He only stood there, listening. The wolf’s howls rose, rattling my nerves as though it lived inside me. Papa stared at the closed shutter. “You can sleep in our bed again tonight,” he said. 49 6. The sun broke through the clouds to shine down on our lost sheep. Drawn to the blooming purple flowers, it had wandered down the slope, near the cliff’s edge. “There she is!” Papa tugged on Royale’s reins as he held up a hand to the rest of us. Our border collie, Valiant, barked beneath him. Pierre pulled his horse, Diamond, to a jarring halt. His arm snaked around my back to keep me from falling off, pressing me closer against him. His father, Monsieur Leóne, followed 50 suit and stopped Ruby, who shifted awkwardly beneath his weight. The four of us paused at the crest of the hill, at the edge of the forest. I clung to Pierre’s warm back, the best protection against the biting cold. The broad grassland below was bathed in sunshine, lush and green and deadly. We saw where our sheep had broken through some taller grass and nibbled its way near the cliff. Beyond its rim, the distant mountains stood guard in a hazy mist. I could barely make out the well-girded wooden bridge that connected them, as it disappeared in the fog halfway across. “Careful now,” Papa said. “Don’t scare it.” He started down first, leading Royale step by step, careful not to stumble. Valiant padded obediently beside him. I peered around Pierre at a huge hole in the ground, that looked as though some giant had taken a bite out of the hill. I hoped Papa and Valiant wouldn’t fall into it. I pressed myself closer, giving Pierre a gentle hug. “Thank you for holding on to me,” I said. “No problem, Red,” he whispered back. I smiled. “You know I can’t wear my cloak anymore, Pierre.” I didn’t count the burlap shawl as a cloak, as I pulled it closer about my shoulders. I had just turned eight years old, but I still wasn’t allowed to wear anything too bright outside. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll always be ‘Red’ to me.” Pierre was the only one who still called me ‘Red’. I had worn that scarlet hooded cloak 51 everywhere, even indoors, for two straight years. I had swept into every room, beaming as the cape fanned out behind me. Wrapped inside it, I always felt as if nothing could harm me. No degree of cold, no sad news, no fears. I felt the same way whenever Pierre called me ‘Red’. Papa and Valiant drew closer and closer to the sheep. It seemed to take forever. I wanted to jump down from Diamond’s back, rush down the hill and scoop it up myself. But, as Papa often reminded me, I needed to learn patience. My foot shook back and forth against Diamond’s flank with anticipation. Diamond whinnied, annoyed. “Helena, stop!” Pierre whispered. “Sorry.” The sheep jerked its head up at the sound. Papa stopped Royale and waited, neither he nor Valiant moving. The sheep finally returned to its grazing. Papa turned slowly to look up the hill at us. I swallowed, feeling my cheeks burn. He continued down, one hoof at a time, as the sheep nibbled at the grassy slope. I stared again at the giant hole. “What’s that?” I whispered. Pierre leaned back to my ear. “Probably left over from the war, when everyone started invading. People had to find all sorts of places to hide away. This must be one somebody dug out.” I pressed against his back, pulling him tight. “Mama told me we had to hide when I was a baby. She wouldn’t tell me anything else about it, though. But I remember looking up and seeing a wide door open above me. There was a big ramp 52 with steps leading out into the sun. I think I was only three years old.” Diamond shuffled his feet and whinnied again. Papa turned sharply and looked right at me. I shrank back behind Pierre. Papa continued down the slope and pulled Royale to a stop, about fifteen feet from the sheep. He clicked his tongue at Valiant, who moved around the animal to stand between it and the cliff’s edge. He barked and the sheep jolted upright, bleating. Valiant barked louder, moving toward it. The sheep shuffled toward Papa, who led Royale behind the sheep to guide it up the hill. We would have no trouble leading it home now. “Come on down,” he called to us. “Let’s take a rest.” He climbed down and took some jerky from his saddle pouch. We descended slowly with Monsieur Leóne and the horses. “What’s that bridge near the mountains?” I asked. “Leads out of the province,” Pierre said. “Across the gorge, then through the mountains. Eventually, if you keep going, you get to the royal palace in Versailles.” “That would be exciting, to see the palace.” Pierre shrugged. “I hear the King’s corrupt.” “Who says that?” “My father. He says the King won’t talk to Duke Laurent at all. We get no support from the court. The Duke keeps asking them to send soldiers here, but the King won’t even answer his letters.” 53 “I heard Papa talking about that with the Duke in the Fall, when he told Francois about the banquet. I wish you could come. We’ve been waiting for it all winter.” He shrugged again. “Only rich people there, besides you and your parents. Heard they invited a couple of people Francois knows, but it’s mostly the Duke’s friends. Think he’s trying to impress everyone with a show.” “You think so?” I asked, concerned. “It’s what royal people do. They don’t necessarily do anything to help, just make it look like they’re doing something. I think the party’s more for the Duke to look good than to honor Francois.” I considered that, then waved it off. “That may be. But the Duke’s not like other royal people.” “True,” Pierre said. “If everyone at the court were like him, we’d probably have those soldiers by now.” “Why do we need soldiers?” He stopped Diamond and turned in his seat, narrowing his eyes at me. They were brown and beautiful beneath his shaggy dirt-blond hair. He could have told me anything right then and I would have sat on his horse and listened for hours. “Because of the wolf,” he said. A lump gathered in my throat. Riding with Pierre through the mountains and rolling hills after being penned up at our cottage these last two months, I had forgotten about the wolf today. “Oh,” I said. 54 “You and your Grand’Mere weren’t the only ones attacked, Red. Other people have been killed over the years. And people are still being killed. But no one’s seen this other wolf in time to stop it. We need soldiers to find it and kill it, so it’ll be safe again.” Safe again. The idea sounded so strange to me. I couldn’t imagine any number of soldiers making me feel safe in La Rue Sauvage. “Do you miss your mother?” I asked. I wanted to change the subject. It was easier to talk about Pierre’s grief than my own. He swiped at his thick hair, showing his forehead for an instant. “Sure. ‘Course I do.” He bit his lip. “But we’ve been pretty busy. Papa’s teaching me all there is to know about smelting and making tools and pots. He tells me I’ve got the skill for it, as much as he did when he was my age. Thinks I’ll make a great blacksmith some day.” Diamond shifted to one side as Pierre maneuvered him past some holes in the side of the hill. I leaned forward and clung tighter to Pierre. “I think so, too,” I told him. “Easy there,” Monsieur Leóne called to both of us, his belly shifting from side to side as he led Ruby down the foothill. “It’s steep. Don’t want to tumble off the edge.” “Yes, Papa,” Pierre said. Below him, Papa stood chewing his jerky. “Everyone all right? Frayne, thanks for spotting her.” Valiant barked as if in agreement. Papa gave him a biscuit from his pouch. 55 “Thought it looked like yours,” Monsieur Leóne said, struggling to climb down. “Next moment, it was gone. Can’t believe it wandered this far so quickly.” He swiped at thin strands of hair falling over his face, the same way Pierre often did. “Just glad I could do something to help.” Papa squatted and brushed some brambles off the sheep’s wool. “Looks like it fell down a hill or two. Good thing it found plenty of grass to nibble on here, before it rolled into the ravine. Sit down. We’ll head back in a minute.” We sat in the grass, chewing on jerky and biscuits and enjoying the fresh air and billowing clouds. I spotted a distant path around the left side of the mountain, far ahead. I stood and walked toward it as Valiant scampered after me, yapping. Papa stood and almost choked on his biscuit. “Helena! Come back from the cliff!” “I’m not near the edge. Look, there’s a road down here.” Someone had built a path around the side of the mountain. It sloped down and gradually worked its way back up to join the broad dirt path leading to the bridge and out of the province. “I said, come back,” Papa repeated. I stuck my fists on my hips. “Papa, I can take care of myself. Don’t you remember I’m eight now?” “You’ve been eight for a week,” he said. He finished chewing and climbed back onto Royale. “And we’ve stayed long enough already. Let’s head home before it gets dark.” 56 My heart sank. I knelt to scratch Valiant behind the ears. “Papa, it’s a beautiful day. Can’t we ride a little farther?” “I let you come along because you wanted to help and you wanted to see Pierre, and I figured it’s just as well to know where you are. We’ve had a nice rest, but it’s time to get back home. Come along.” He nudged Royale’s flanks and started a quick trot up the hill. Monsieur Leóne followed suit with Ruby. “Sorry, Red,” Pierre said. “It’s so pretty here.” I stared out at the endless mountain range beyond the bridge, shrouded in fog and mystery. I didn’t mind the moist chill on my shoulders, if it meant being free to roam outside, beyond our meadow, even for a little while. I found myself staring through the haze at the bridge leading out of La Rue Sauvage. It lay just beyond the wide green plateau that stretched away on both sides and ended in two points, resembling a large sleeping crocodile. Pierre mounted Diamond and bent to offer his hand. I took it and climbed up behind him. We turned slowly from the inviting scene. Pierre took his time leaving, knowing how much I wanted to stay. He was giving me every second he could. “Come on, Pierre,” Papa called from the crest of the hill. “I thought you said that horse was fast.” There was humor in his voice. I couldn’t remember the last time he sounded happy. “The fastest,” Pierre called back. “Well, prove it! We need to get the sheep settled so we can make it to the banquet.” 57 “Hey, look at that,” Pierre said, inspired. “What?” “There’s a hole down on this end, too.” I looked where he was pointing as Valiant started barking and growling at it. Behind a boulder at our far right, close to the edge, another enormous hole had been dug through the side of the hill, nearly big enough to fit a wagon. “It’s a tunnel.” “Yeah. Leading straight up to the top.” I smiled. “You’re so smart, Pierre.” “Hang on.” He spurred Diamond toward the hole. Diamond snorted and kicked up dirt as Valiant barked and chased after us. I clung tighter to Pierre while Papa and Monsieur Leóne gaped, before breaking into a gallop after us. It must have looked like we were headed over the cliff. Valiant stopped short near the dark passage and fell back, to race up the hill instead. We curved around the boulder and Papa’s frantic image vanished as we descended into the tunnel’s black mouth. The swallowing darkness and cold frightened me for a moment, but I pressed close against Pierre. My eyes adjusted quickly, as light bled in from the other end of the tunnel and from small holes dug into the earth above us. They would be invisible on the surface, but here below they gave extra light and air. Pierre was right about men hollowing out this tunnel for refuge during the war. Diamond’s hooves clomped over several logs that had been buried in the ground to create a partial stairway. 58 Something stirred in the darkness up ahead. A large animal had hunched over something in the center of the tunnel and now raised its head, its eyes flashing on us. Its blue-gray eyes. The wolf growled from somewhere deep in its belly as we rushed past it, its breath forming a white shroud. “Hurry!” I cried. Pierre leaned forward in the saddle, urging Diamond up the dark slope. Behind us, the black wolf watched us go. I heard his mouth smacking on something he was eating. Something he must have dragged down here to finish off. Then he started after us. “Go, Pierre! Faster!” Pierre pushed Diamond harder and we lunged forward. The enormous wolf loped after us in greater strides. It would sink its teeth into us in seconds. “GO!” Light filled the end of the tunnel as it formed a steeper angle, where extra logs had been laid. I felt a touch of the sun’s warmth as we neared the opening. The wolf slowed and skidded to a halt, letting us flee. We burst out of the upper end, my heart pounding as I gasped for breath. “Helena!” Papa thundered, his angry voice bringing a strange sense of calm. “What did you think you were doing?’ Valiant barked and growled at the hole behind us. 59 Monsieur Leóne trotted up to us, his eyes wide beneath his wild, unkempt hair. “Do you realize what might have happened? Who knows what might be in there?” I had never seen him so agitated. Pierre was flustered. “Papa, there was something! There was – !” “Let’s go home!” I interrupted. “We’re really sorry, Papa. Monsieur Leóne. We won’t do it again. Let’s just – Let’s just hurry home so we can get to the banquet.” “But –!” Pierre burst. “Pierre, we made a mistake. We shouldn’t have gone in there. Let’s just go home, all right? Let’s just go home.” He breathed deeply in and out, staring at me in fright. “Helena. What happened?” Papa asked. “We – We almost tripped. On a tree root. Almost fell over. We got scared. That’s all. Let’s all just hurry home and forget about it, all right? Please?” Pierre looked from me to Papa and Monsieur Leóne. He slowed his frantic breathing as Valiant watched the tunnel with a murmuring growl. He stared at me again, then back at the quiet hole. “All right. Let’s forget about it. For now.” “Just don’t try anything so foolish again,” Papa said. “You might both have been killed.” Pierre led Diamond away. I squinted over my shoulder. From deep within the darkness, the blue-gray eyes shone as if studying our every move. 60 7. Papa pulled our wagon up to the front of the tavern. The sign above its hitching post said La Maison de Touraine. We sat for a moment, listening to the raucous men laughing and shouting inside as Papa regarded Mama. She sat rigid, drawing her shawl closer against the evening air, her chin angled up. “I simply can’t understand why it had to be here, of all places. After we waited all winter for the Duke to arrange this. I thought we were supposed to be 61 honoring someone. What’s honorable about surrounding ourselves with a lot of drinking?” They had been silent for most of the ride. At first I thought Papa was still angry at me for riding through the tunnel with Pierre. Then I remembered how Mama felt about alcohol and the place Duke Laurent chose for Francois’ banquet. Besides, I had already promised Papa I would never do it again. And I meant it. I still pictured those blue-gray eyes, shining as they had chased me and Pierre. As they had watched us leave the grassy cliff. Entering that tunnel again would be like jumping into the wolf’s mouth. The tavern’s double doors flew open with a bang and I yelped as two men burst from inside. Their boots clomped across the porch beside the hitching post as they guffawed, one slapping the other on the back. I sighed, quivering. Mama put an arm around me, tugging me close. She frowned at Papa. “Helena doesn’t need to be around men like these. Especially after all that’s happened.” Papa studied me, weighing his decision. “It’s for Francois,” he said. “We won’t stay long.” Mama gave me another strong squeeze, then waited for Papa to hitch up Royale and help her down. He brought me down next. He never swung me in the air anymore, the way Francois did, though I was light enough and my wounds had all mended. Instead, he set me down like I was a porcelain doll. 62 Mama put her hand on my shoulder and we pushed through the large oak double doors. Inside, men roared with laughter and deafening shouts. Some waved their fists in the air as they spoke. I backed into Mama, then clutched her hand with both of mine. This place looked like it could get out of control within seconds. Duke Laurent spotted us from across the room. He strode toward us with open arms, which gave me some assurance. No one could harm us with the Duke standing close by. “Henri! Celeste! So good to see you!” He shook Papa’s hand and kissed Mama’s, then smiled at me. “And how are you today, Helena?” “A bit nervous,” Mama answered for me. “I’m afraid this isn’t the most suitable environment for an eight-year old girl.” Papa put a hand on Mama’s shoulder, too late to quiet her. The Duke’s face fell. “I am so sorry,” he said. “I know Francois frequents this place and I know some men who come here. I thought it would be ideal to recognize his actions. I’m afraid I failed to consider what a difficult position it would put you in.” He gave a little laugh. “Perhaps that is why the royal family places so little faith in me.” “It’s all right, Your Grace,” Papa said. “We’re sure you planned this out as best you could.” Mama’s face softened as she met my eyes. I held her hand more loosely now, feeling safer 63 with the Duke standing between us and the crowd. “Yes, we’re here for Francois, after all,” she said. The Duke kissed Mama’s hand again, bowing lower. “The grace of a Queen. Henri is fortunate to have you, and I’m fortunate to have your forgiveness. Now, please, come in and we’ll find Francois. Ah, Simonet! You have not met Henri’s family. Madame Basque, may I present my chief advisor, Siegfried Simonet. Monsieur Simonet, this is Henri’s wife, Madame Celeste Basque, and their daughter, Helena Basque.” The Duke’s advisor loomed over me, tall, thin and frowning, with stringy black hair that rode down his back like the Duke’s. He regarded me with lazy eyes and gave a disinterested nod. I resisted the urge to flinch. Thankfully, Monsieur Simonet turned from me to shake hands with Papa and nod at Mama. He seemed just as unconcerned with them, and quickly turned to Duke Laurent. “How many more guests do you anticipate?” he asked. “Our guest of honor wants to make certain you are providing enough wine and ale.” The Duke laughed. He turned to spread his arms wide as Francois came thundering toward him. “For our hero, all the wine and ale he wants!” “That’sss what I like to hearrr!” Francois said, stumbling a little as he approached. ‘Most grateful for your hossspitality, Your Highnesss.” I prepared to run toward him, to let him swing me through the air. But Mama’s hand pressed on my shoulder and held me back. 64 Papa stepped forward. “Francois. Good to see you.” “Heyyy,” Francois said, blinking at Papa as if he didn’t recognize him. “Henri. And Celeste.” He turned to me and crouched, pressing his hands over his knees. One fist held a dark half-empty bottle. “And there’s little Helena. How’rrre you, little Mademoissselle?” “Fine,” I said. “Are you all right, Francois?” He waved me off and stood, like an old woman trying to rise from her rocking chair. “‘Courssse. ‘Course I am. Just enjoying this wonderful party the Duke’s giving me, that’s all. After your birthday, it’s jussst been onne party after anothhher.” The Duke winked at me. “He’s fine, Helena.” He smiled at Simonet. “I don’t suppose you’ll indulge yourself with any wine tonight, Simonet?” Simonet maintained his frown. “I prefer to keep myself alert.” Duke Laurent leaned toward Papa. “Simonet is extremely self-disciplined. He’s the closest thing I have to a priest.” I looked about, hopeful to see our actual priest. “Is Father Vestille here?” “I invited him,” Duke Laurent said. “But he declined.” Francois barked out a laugh. “He’s afraid of the beer!” Papa leaned close to the Duke as Francois continued to laugh louder. “He’s visiting one of the 65 other provinces. Dijon. There’s a large church there –.” “Ah, of course,” the Duke said. “Can’t expect him to remain satisfied with a tiny province like La Rue Sauvage forever. I wish him success.” Papa knit his brow. “He’s not seeking a better position. Just visiting.” “Oh, he has friends there?” “Yes. Well – friends he’s made there. On previous visits.” “Ah. I see,” the Duke said, smiling. I looked from one face to the other, trying to understand. “What are you saying, Monsieur Laurent?” “Nothing at all, Helena. For any man, even a priest, there comes a time to think about the future. I came here from Versailles myself and I’m quite proud of our accomplishments. But I wouldn’t blame anyone for seeking opportunity in a larger province. Somewhere more comfortable or safe. A man like Father Vestille could become very influential if he found the right church.” I felt as if he had ripped my heart out and left a gaping hole in my chest. “You think he wants to leave?” He shrugged. “I couldn’t tell you what he’s planning. But I find it hard to imagine him remaining content with a small church when he could do so much more, and be well-rewarded for his service. And there are certainly safer places to preach than La Rue Sauvage.” Mama bowed her head and spoke in the firm voice she usually reserved for scolding me. 66 “We’ve known Father Abier Vestille for years. We invited him here from Burgundy, after we settled. He’s not cowardly or opportunistic and never has been. He only wants to serve others.” “I certainly understand that,” the Duke said. “But – well, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure if you know him that well, you know the true purpose of his trip to Dijon.” Papa shifted his foot as Mama fell silent. “He didn’t say. Exactly.” The Duke looked from Papa to Mama and back again, still offering a friendly smile. He cleared his throat, sounding uncomfortable. “No matter, Henri. Whatever the reason, I’m certain his trips take precedence. Come. Enjoy the party. We have a wonderful feast.” He strode toward a table filled with rich food and we moved to follow him, though I began to drag my feet. Father Vestille had always been like part of our family. Before last year, he visited our house every Sunday after Mass. We ate lamb or stew and talked about the Scripture lessons and the events in the village and the new dress Mama was making. He sat me on his lap to tell him everything the sheep and Valiant were doing, everything I saw in the field that day, every cloud and flower and insect. Before last year, that is. Before the wolf. “Hey, Helennna,” Francois said, bending down to take my arm. “Hey, let me introduce you to a friennnd of mine.” He waved a heavy hand 67 toward the bar, as though he were trying to fish something out of the air. Mama started toward me, but Papa held her back with an arm around her shoulder. “She’ll be all right. It’s their party. We’re safe in here, at least.” Mama relented and they stepped away with the Duke. A man wearing an apron stepped out from behind the bar and marched toward us. He had strong arms and a broad, crooked smile beneath a mop of reddish-brown hair. Francois waved his arm toward the man and thumped him in the chest. “This’s my bessst friend in all of France. Gerard Touraine. He ownsss the place.” “He’s the one you told me about, right?” I asked. Monsieur Touraine put his hands on his knees and bent toward me. “So you’re the little girl my overbearing friend here rescued. May I say, Mademoiselle, how pleased I am that he did.” I felt myself blush. “Thank you, Monsieur.” “She’s not ssso little anymore,” Francois said with a silly smile. “She just turned eight.” Monsieur Touraine’s eyebrows rose. “Eight? I can tell.” “Thank you,” I beamed. “Like I said,” Francois continued. “If you ever need anything, if you ever need real help, Gerard’sss your man. He’ll take care of you, whateverrr you need. I promissse.” 68 Monsieur Touraine slid a sideways glance at Francois, then smiled back at me. “Well, for now, how about this?” He reached into the front pocket of his apron and pulled out a peppermint stick. “My favorite!” I gasped. “Is it?” Monsieur Touraine asked, grinning at Francois. “Isn’t that a coincidence? I had no idea.” “See what I mean? Anything you need, jussst come to Gerard. He’ll alwaysss take care of you.” Monsieur Touraine put a hand on Francois’s shoulder. “Such as taking care of seeing you home tonight, friend.” Francois sputtered and waved him off. “The Duke’sss servants’re seeing me home tonight. You hearrr that? The Duke’s!” “A hero’s wages,” Monsieur Touraine laughed. He bent to kiss my hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle.” He turned and moved back to the bar, where he poured a drink for one of the men sitting there. “He’s nice,” I said. “The nicccest.” “I’m glad everyone knows you’re a hero now.” “Awww.” Francois blinked, his face turning serious. “You know what a – You know what a hero is, Helena? A hero doesn’t have to be big or strong or sssmart. He just has to stand up to do what’sss got to be done. People might not underssstand what you’re doin’ or why you’re 69 doin’ it. But it’s still got to be done, whether they understand it or not. A hero’s just sssomebody who stands up to do it when nobody else will. That’sss all. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped. All I did was stand up.” I smiled. “Well, you’re my hero.” He grinned at me. “Yeah? Well, you’re mine!” He lifted his bottle toward me. “Cheersss, Mademoiselle.” I clinked my peppermint stick against it. “Cheers, Monsieur.” He took a deep swig from his ale while I sucked on my candy. 70 8. “That was the best party last night,” I beamed, no longer focusing on the needle and thread in my hands. Mama wanted me to practice sewing straight lines on an old patch, but I was too excited. She sat beside me at our dining table, creating a new dress. “It was interesting,” she said, her voice subdued as she stared at the linen and lace spread over her lap. I glanced at my needle to keep from pricking myself. “I met Monsieur Touraine. He 71 owns the tavern and he’s Francois’ best friend. He gave me three peppermints. And we ate peanuts and pretzels and drank ginger beer, and Francois showed me how to blow bubbles in it.” Mama gave a small smile. “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.” I fixed my attention on the needle and thread. “Once I learn how to sew this patch, I can start sewing dresses. And then you can teach me how to sew clothes for you and Papa.” “That’s right, dear. But keep working on that patch first. Careful you don’t get another snarl.” “I’m gonna be a great seamstress, just like you and Grand’Mere Marie.” Her gaze dropped into her lap. “… She made some beautiful things.” I squinted at the needle and thread, still struggling to make a good backstitch. I stopped again. “When I’m older, maybe I can serve at a fancy party. Like the one last night. Except with more ladies. I could make dresses for everyone.” “That would be nice,” Mama said. “Or someone might invite you.” I shook my head. “No. But no one needs to invite me. I just want to make something beautiful for someone to wear. Something bright red. If I can’t have a pretty face, I can still make pretty dresses like you.” Mama stared at the material in her lap, saying nothing. I frowned. “Too bad Father Vestille couldn’t come.” 72 “Yes. We missed seeing him.” I pretended to study my needle. “Mama? Do you think what Monsieur Laurent said is true? Do you think Father Vestille wants to leave?” Her face screwed up. “Not a word. With all respect, our Duke doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” “How do you know for sure? What if Father Vestille wants to move somewhere else, like back to Burgundy?” She put down her sewing. “Father Vestille came here when we learned there had been no priest in La Rue Sauvage for eight years. He’s been here ever since. He has no intention of leaving.” “But that was before.” Her eyebrows rose. “Before what?” I stiffened. “Before the wolf.” She leaned forward. “You imagine he’s running away?” I shrugged. “We never see him anymore. He’s always traveling, always visiting other people. Ever since last year.” She lowered her chin. “Listen to me, Helena. Your father and I trust Father Vestille with our lives. He would not leave without telling us first, if he ever actually considered leaving. And he won’t abandon us.” “But how can you know for certain? What if he’s changed? He’s not like Francois or Duke Laurent. He’s just an ordinary man. Maybe he’s worried there’s another wolf out there.” Mama sighed. “Helena. Father Vestille has always helped us whenever we needed it. He 73 always will. I don’t know what his trips involve. He never wants to discuss it. But I trust him. You don’t have to know all of a person’s activities to know you can depend on them. And you don’t have to be strong or influential to be brave.” I hoped she was right. That Father Vestille would never leave us. But I couldn’t stop wondering. “All right. If you’re certain.” She smiled into her lap, returning to her sewing. “There are many things I’m not certain about,” she said. “But I’m certain of Father Vestille.” I didn’t dare argue with her further. I heard Papa’s boots clomp onto the porch, then stop. We both turned. The front door creaked open, letting in the early morning chill. Papa entered as though he had seen a ghost. “Papa, what’s wrong?” I asked. We had left the banquet early last night and made it home well before nightfall, but Mama and Papa had let me sleep as late as I wanted. My head was still filled with memories of the roast duck and caviar and raspberry tarts, and meeting Monsieur Touraine and the Duke’s friends. What could possibly have spoiled Papa’s mood after such a thrilling party? “Celeste. I need – I need to speak with you.” “Papa?” His eyes warned me to keep still. “Stay inside.” Mama dropped her sewing and swept toward the front door. She hurried outside and Papa shut the door behind her. 74 I stayed inside as I was told and continued working on the practice patch, determined to sew a straight line. My thread snarled into another knot and I grumbled. How could I concentrate when Papa was on the front stoop sharing some dreadful secret? But I kept to my place. I tried to loosen the tiny knot and start over with my line. I didn’t even creep closer to listen. Until Mama wailed. I ran to the door and threw it open. Mama covered her face with both hands, sobbing. Papa held her by the shoulders. She looked as though she might crumple to the ground if he let go. “What happened? What is it?” “Back inside!” Papa barked. I stepped away from his glare of rage. I slammed the door and marched back to the table. I snatched up my patch, with its needle and tangled thread, and slapped it down on the tabletop. Stupid patch! Why couldn’t I at least make something that wasn’t ugly? They were keeping something from me. Something terrible. Like they kept everything else. I couldn’t venture outside. I couldn’t be left alone. I couldn’t go anywhere, even with them, if it got too late in the day. They meant to keep me cooped up in our cottage forever. I slumped back into my chair. I was still seething when the door opened, an inch at a time. Papa trudged in with a wary look, like he was afraid of me. Or of something else. “Helena …” 75 He moved like a sleepwalker to the chair beside me. Mama followed him like a dutiful soldier, head down. Her face red, her eyes squinting and sore. “Helena,” Papa started again. “Something happened to Francois.” “What?” I glanced from one solemn face to the other. “Is Crimson all right?” Papa seemed to stare through me at someone else or someplace else. “I believe so. But Lightning is gone.” “Gone where?” Mama turned aside. The sunlight from the windows glinted off the tears on her cheeks. “Henri, perhaps we should talk about this another time …” “No, Celeste. She’s going to hear it from someone over the next few days. It’s just as well that she hear it from us.” Mama fixed her gaze on me and stiffened. I felt as though they were waiting for something to happen to me. “What’s wrong? Tell me.” Papa swiped his large hands over his face. As if trying to wipe something away. “Helena. … Francois is dead. So is his mare.” I stared at Papa, trying to understand. Stared at his mouth that had just spoken those words. Saw him speak them again, in my mind. He said Francois was dead, just like Grand’Mere Marie was dead. Just like Pierre’s mother. Dead. “… How come?” My throat felt strangled. 76 Papa licked his lips. Glanced from side to side. Sat back a little in his chair. “Some wolves attacked him. In his house.” My mind saw the blue-gray eyes again, shining out of the black tunnel. Shining out of the dark forest. Watching me. Waiting. I breathed deeper. Felt my heart beat faster. “How did they get inside?” Papa scratched at his chin. “His door – somehow came off its hinges. And they all went in.” My temples throbbed, my lip quivering. “How many?” He shook his head. “I don’t know. Looked like four of them, at the least.” “How do you know?” “Henri,” Mama interrupted. “She’s going to hear it,” he repeated. Mama bit her lip. Papa swallowed. He stared straight into my eyes. “What happened to Francois – was very sad. When they found him, he was – he was not in one piece. They tore him asunder. Lieutenant-General Sharrad figures it took at least four of them to do it.” My insides felt hollow as a dead log. “And the mare?” “Henri …” Papa’s eyes continued to burrow into me. “She was the same. All over the stable. They found the foal tied up in its stall. Seemed to be struggling to get out.” “We’ve got to go get him!” I shrieked. 77 Papa paled. “We can’t care for an extra horse, Helena. He needs to go someplace where he can –.” “We’ve got to get him, Papa! We’ve got to bring him home before the wolves come back!” Mama took a step forward. “Francois may have relatives nearby, dear. They might want the foal for –.” “Crimson is mine! Francois promised him to me.” Papa’s eyebrows knit together. “He didn’t so much as promise to –.” “He promised I could ride him. How can I ride him if someone takes him away? How can I take care of him? The wolves came back for Francois. They’ll come for Crimson next.” They exchanged puzzled looks. Mama bent over me. “Darling, what do you mean, ‘the wolves came back’?” “Because Francois saved me. Because he killed one of them, and they wanted revenge.” Papa lowered his head and met my eyes. “Helena. Wolves don’t take revenge.” My eyes narrowed back at his. “They’re not wolves.” They gaped at me as I remembered the wolf looming over me on its hind legs, grinning with its sharp fangs. Those same eyes would always be there, shining in my memory and my nightmares. Mocking me. Threatening me. Terrifying me. “Where’s my cloak?” Their eyes bulged. 78 Mama wrung her hands. “Dear. Why do you ask?” “I want it. Where is it?” “It’s put away,” Papa said, straightening in his chair. “It’s mine. Grand’Mere Marie made it for me. Give it to me.” Mama lowered her chin. “Helena, that is no way to speak to your father.” “Where’s my cloak?” I demanded. I no longer cared what they would do to me for being so brash. Papa’s moustache formed a dark frown. “Helena. You’re never to wear that cloak again.” I turned from them and marched through the cottage. I knocked over books and cleared away half-sewn dresses from Mama’s table. Papa stood. “Calm yourself this instant, young lady.” I rummaged through baskets and pots and wooden boxes. “Where is it? I want to wear it. It’s mine! I want to wear it right now!” “Helena, stop,” Mama begged. I ran to their room at the rear of the cottage. I opened boxes of their personal items, boxes I was never allowed to touch. “It’s my cloak!” “Stop it, Helena,” Papa growled. “Stop now!” I kept digging, past Mama’s leather-bound journal and her flasks of perfume. Past Papa’s snuff pouches and spare cartridges and his old crossbow from the war. “Helena!” 79 Papa’s massive fist closed around my wrist and yanked me away. He held me against his chest as I thrashed about. I didn’t care if he dragged me outside and flogged me with a switch for acting like a spoiled brat. What did it matter if he beat me? What did anything matter anymore? He held me. Held me tight and refused to let me go. I wriggled against him, pounding my small fists on his chest. I shut my eyes, ground my teeth, beat my head against him. Then I collapsed and bawled into his tunic. “I want my cloak,” I cried, gushing tears. “I want to wear my red cloak.” Papa’s breath rustled in and out of his lungs like a bear, as Mama’s gentle hands stroked my hair. “I’ll ask about the horse,” Papa said at last. “We can build another stall for the stable.” 80 9. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over the body of Francois Revelier. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as if he could see the body beneath the heavy lid. “I did not know 81 Francois Revelier well,” he said. “I wish I did. What I do know is that he was a brave man. An honorable man. A man whom others could depend on. As a foreman in his woodcutting business. As a neighbor. And as a friend. Francois Revelier risked his life in an attempt to save his own neighbor, Marie Justine. He heard her cries too late to rescue her, but because of his bravery, his compassion, and his willingness to act, he rescued her granddaughter, Helena Basque, who sits here among us today.” He extended an open hand toward me. Several heads turned. Staring at me and my scars. “Because of his swift and courageous action, the Basque family – and all of us as well – were spared sorrow upon sorrow. They lost a beloved mother that day, a kind woman I knew back in Burgundy, who moved here to be with her daughter and their family.” Mama withdrew a lace handkerchief, one she had embroidered herself, and wiped at her eyes, sniffing. “Francois was a good neighbor to her, to the very end,” Father Vestille continued. “If he could have given his life for hers, I believe he would have. Because that is what he was willing to do for Helena.” Mama wrapped her arm around me and squeezed me closer. “It is ironic – and tragic – that he should suffer the same fate as Marie Justine, a year after destroying the wolf that claimed her life.” Father Vestille paused, as though thinking of something 82 else. Something important. Then he went on. “We can’t fully understand these events, any more than we can understand any such tragedy. But I hope we can all agree on one thing. Whether we knew Francois as a close friend or neighbor, or only heard of his actions in saving young Helena, Francois Revelier was a hero.” I felt as though my guts had been hollowed out. Father Vestille was right. Francois was a hero. But now he was gone. And the wolves were still out there. Who else would stand up to them? The Mass ended. Papa and Monsieur Leóne joined four other men to carry the casket outside. They secured thick ropes under it and lowered it down into a dark rectangular pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Francois there in the dirt forever. “I don’t understand,” Pierre said, suddenly beside me. “Don’t understand what,” I said. My throat felt like dry leaves. “Those wolves. Four of them, maybe more. Just breaking into Francois’ house and attacking him all at once. Like they meant to do it.” I said nothing. I just stared into the dark hole. “Red. That animal we saw, in the tunnel near the bridge. You think that might have been one of them?” “… yes.” “We should have said something. Somebody could’ve stopped it.” 83 I kept staring into the emptiness. Wondering if Pierre was right. But who could we have told? Who would have stopped that wolf, let alone the others? “We gotta be careful,” Pierre went on. “Things like that running around, attacking out of nowhere. I can understand why your parents don’t go out at night.” “Pierre!” I glanced to see Monsieur Leóne beckoning Pierre away. He was speaking to a couple of people I didn’t recognize. “I think Papa’s gathering some new clients. Probably wants me to talk to them, too, to discuss what we can make for them.” He touched my shoulder. “Red. You all right?” I stood stiff and unmoving. Then I nodded, for Pierre’s sake. “Just take care, all right? Those wolves make me nervous.” He hurried away to join his father. “They’re not wolves,” I muttered to no one. At the back of the crowd, I saw Francois’ friend, Monsieur Touraine. He stared sadly at the hole where Francois was laid, but his gaze soon turned blank. I wanted to speak to him, but he turned suddenly and disappeared. “I’ll write to the court again,” Duke Laurent was telling Papa, as he and Mama approached from behind me. “I’ll send Simonet there in person if I have to. Maybe the guards will let him through. Or at least recognize the urgency. They have to see we need soldiers and hunters here 84 to help Lieutenant-General Sharrad’s police kill these things.” “I would appreciate that, Monsieur,” Papa said, sounding numb. Almost as numb as I felt. “Helena. Are you ready to go? Did you get to speak to Father Vestille?” I turned, spotting Father Vestille shaking hands with a couple of guests across the graveyard. “No,” I said, my senses burning. “Not yet.” I strode straight past Papa and Mama and Duke Laurent toward Father Vestille, as he smiled and nodded and showed his concern for the couple talking to him. A couple of people I had never seen before. People he must have visited all of last week, when he disappeared on another of his frequent journeys. Father Vestille lowered his head and spoke quietly with them, a man and a woman in a plain cloak and shawl, which the woman curled about her shoulders as she listened. Seeing me, Father Vestille stopped speaking abruptly. He managed a small smile. “Helena. I want you to meet some friends of mine. This is Monsieur and Madame Serrone, from DeSarte. They came to –.” “Where were you? Where did you go?” I glared up at him, fists clenched. I knew his friends were gaping at me in shock but I didn’t bother looking. I couldn’t care less about them. “I was – visiting some friends.” Father Vestille tugged at his collar with two fingers. “I went to DeSarte, to visit the Serrones here, and some others at their parish.” 85 “That’s why you couldn’t come to Francois’ party?” His Adam’s apple shifted as he swallowed, like a minstrel performer who had forgotten his next line. Did he assume no one would question him? Where he went, what he did? And why? “I wanted to come. I simply – There were other matters I had to attend to, Helena. I’m sorry I couldn’t be with you.” “That doesn’t help anyone now. Does it?” “Helena!” Papa barked. “Mind how you speak to Father Vestille.” He bent down behind me, his harsh breath on my neck, but I didn’t turn. I kept staring into Father Vestille’s pleading eyes. “I’m – sorry, Helena,” Father Vestille said. “I would have come if I could.” “But you couldn’t,” I finished. “Because you had to visit your other friends.” “Helena, that is enough,” Papa growled. As I held Father Vestille’s gaze, his lip quivered. I didn’t care. He should have been sorry. So should Duke Laurent, for not making the King listen and send soldiers. So should Papa and Monsieur Leóne, for doing so little to stop the wolves themselves, and Mama for pretending everything would be all right. Why wouldn’t anyone do something? Francois was the only one willing to act, and now he was gone. “Helena, we’re going home,” Papa said. I didn’t turn to him. I just kept staring into Father Vestille’s sunken eyes. Then I whirled and 86 marched straight toward our wagon. “We don’t have a home.” “Helena!” Papa shouted. His voice broke off as he started to call me again, and I knew Mama’s calming hand was on his arm. I heard her speak gently to Father Vestille. “Please forgive her, Father. She’s angry.” I marched to the wagon, ready to knock aside anyone who stood in my way. Yes, I thought. I’m angry. 87 10. Crimson thundered across the grass, kicking up dirt and fallen leaves as I pulled back on his reins for an abrupt halt. I had grown taller in the last eighteen months, to sit high in the saddle. And I had ridden Crimson so much over the summer that I felt we could read each other’s minds. I barely needed to pull the reins anymore, in any direction, to tell him what I wanted him to do. “Watch this, Mama!” From the front stoop, Mama looked up from her sewing. She cast another glance toward 88 the darkening forest, before returning her attention to me. Papa had been gone all day on his hunt. “Turn!” I called, nudging Crimson’s flanks and tugging the reins to the left. Crimson spun in a dizzying circle. Once, twice, a third time. Then he stomped his front hooves to stop as I pulled back on the reins. “Be careful, dear,” Mama said. “I’m always careful. Watch this!” I nudged Crimson again and we charged at the sheep pen, kicking up dirt as we stopped abruptly at the edge of the gate. The sheep bleated in terror and nearly fell all over themselves. “Did you see that, Mama? They’re hilarious!” “Helena. Don’t scare the sheep.” I frowned. What else was there for me to do? The horses and sheep were all fed and watered. And I had long since given up on learning how to sew. I would never have Mama’s patience. But I had finally discovered something I could master. I could ride. For the first year since Francois was killed, Crimson and I had simply played, running back and forth in the yard. At times, he needed me to calm him, at the sound of a wolf’s howl. Not to calm his fears, but his rage, as he searched about the yard for the source of the sound, ready to charge after it. I coaxed him with pieces of apple or sugar at first, and he soon learned to calm at the sound of my voice. Papa worried that it was too soon to saddle Crimson at the start of the summer, soon after my 89 ninth birthday. But Crimson was strong and seemed eager for it. When he saw the saddle in Papa’s hands, he stomped at the ground, then stayed steady and quiet as Papa fit him with it. As if he wanted me to ride him the way he had seen other visitors ride their horses. We started slowly at first, as Papa led me in a circle around the meadow. Within two weeks, Crimson and I could ride on our own. Which we did every day, for the rest of the summer. “Mama!” I called again as I climbed off the saddle. She looked up. I moved to Crimson’s right side and stuck my left foot in the stirrup. Then I grabbed the saddle’s horn and shouted, “Hah!” Crimson trotted toward the stoop as I hung alongside him, one foot in the stirrup, the other dangling in the air. Mama dropped her sewing. “Helena!” “It’s all right, Mama. I’ve been practicing.” She was still standing with her delicate fists clenched as we trotted up to her, her eyes bulging as I jumped down. “See, Mama? I’m fine.” She said nothing. Just stared at me, her breathing shallow and rapid against the lace bodice of her dress. Crimson snorted and turned toward the forest. I glanced back to see Papa approaching on Royale. A thin animal carcass, tied to the rear of his saddle, scraped a trail through the piles of dead leaves behind him. “Papa!” I called. 90 He waved toward us and continued plodding closer. He always seemed to ride home slowly after a hunt, and this one had obviously been difficult. I turned to Mama. “Can I ride over the hill? Just to the other end of the meadow?” “You know you can’t. Especially near dark.” “Papa goes out.” “Papa hunts.” Royale trudged closer through the scraping leaves. I climbed back onto the saddle and urged Crimson to race toward him. “Papa! I learned a new trick!” “Helena, wait!” He held up a hand, looking alarmed. “It’s all right, I can do it!” I called as we drew near them. “What did you –?” The carcass behind them was a black wolf. Crimson whinnied. I tugged back on his reins and gasped, as his hooves kicked up dirt and leaves. Crimson snorted and stomped again. I patted his head to calm him. “Papa! What –? Why did you –?” “I was chasing a rabbit. So was this thing. I missed the rabbit but shot him.” His face turned to stone. “It’s meat.” I settled Crimson down with some effort. Then I made him canter forward at an easy pace. We paused behind Royale and I stared at the silent animal while Crimson quivered and snorted beneath me. 91 The wolf’s claws were open, as if they could still strike. The twisted jaws and fangs looked ready to devour. The open, unseeing eyes stared mindlessly at the sky. They were not blue-gray. I steadied my breathing as I studied the wolf. The wolf Papa had brought to our home. “It was all I could find,” he said in a softer tone. I focused on breathing in and out. In and out. “I understand,” I said. I turned Crimson away and urged him back to the cottage. Crimson tossed his head and gave another snort of agitation. He surely felt the same rage, seeing the creature that took his own mother from him last year. Though this animal was different from that monster. This was just an ordinary wolf. Mama gasped as Papa arrived at the front stoop. “Henri! What on earth –?” “All I could find,” he repeated. “Couldn’t let good meat go to waste. It’s dinner.” The sun continued to sink toward the horizon. The sky would grow black in another few hours and we would shut ourselves inside. I half-turned. “It’s dead?” “Of course,” Papa said. “I shot it.” I looked back at the horizon, shivering, though not because of the evening chill. “It’s all right,” I said. I heard Papa climb down from the saddle. Heard him untie the animal. The animal I didn’t want to see, though I already saw it in my every nightmare. 92 I set my jaw. “Turn,” I ordered Crimson, tugging his reins. We turned about to face it. The long black animal that could no longer harm anyone or anything, because Papa had shot it. It could no longer attack me, except in my dreams. It was dead. Crimson bristled beneath me, but he settled as I stroked his flank. As we faced the wolf together. Papa carried it to the carving table next to the sheep pen, as Crimson and I watched. Mama wrung her hands and followed him. I climbed down from Crimson’s back and led him toward them. Mama stared at the furry beast stretched across the flat surface. I heard Papa mutter, “It was the best I could do, my dear.” “I know,” she murmured back. She heaved a slow sigh, then held out her hand. Papa tugged the cleaver up from the wooden tabletop where he had buried it that morning. He handed it to Mama, then walked back toward the house. Mama stared at the dead beast another moment before she swung the cleaver down to hack off its head. Blood spurted up and dirtied her lace dress. She didn’t bother trying to clean it off. I hitched Crimson to the porch and followed Papa into the house. He grabbed his pipe from the mantle and lit it, then sat in his rocking chair, puffing away. I stood nearby but he would 93 not look at me, as he kept puffing and rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. “Papa, teach me to hunt.” He gagged and coughed a couple of times, his muddy boots stamping the floor as he bent forward. I feared he might choke on his tobacco. “… What did you say?” “Teach me to hunt,” I repeated. He continued to stare at me. Then he looked away, returning to his rocking and smoking. “You don’t need to hunt anything,” he said with a dismissive air. I relaxed my shoulders and stood taller. “You won’t always be around. I can’t stay indoors forever. Someday I’ll have to go out. And I’ll have to be prepared, if I ever meet one of them.” He waved me off. “No,” he said in a harsher tone, his smoke permeating the room. “You don’t need to worry about those wolves. They’re not your concern. Duke Laurent will have the King send soldiers to handle them.” I took a step forward. “Papa. No soldiers are coming. We’re the only soldiers we have.” He puffed in silence, staring at nothing. He leaned forward and swiped his hand over his forehead. As if he wanted to wipe away everything that had happened. Grand’Mere’s death. My scars. Francois’ death. All the terror we lived with for the last two years. But nothing could wipe it away and he knew it. I could tell, as he hung his head and shut his eyes. 94 “I know you want to protect me, Papa. But even if I stayed here forever, what’s to stop the wolves from breaking in the windows, like they did at Francois’ house?” His eyes flashed at me in a sudden rage. As if he had never considered that possibility. Or as if he had considered it for many nights since Francois’ death, but knew he could do nothing about it. “Papa, I need you to really protect me. Protect me by showing me how to protect myself.” He stared at the far wall, as if I no longer stood in the room. He puffed at his pipe, the smoke rising in gray wisps. “I’ll think on it,” he said. “Go settle the horses.” I walked out front, leaving him to smoke, his head in his hand. I stepped outside and unhitched Crimson. Then I gathered Royale by the reins and led him past Mama to the stable, settling him in his stall and giving him some water. I stepped outside the stable to catch Crimson’s eye and whistled for him. He sprang from his place and charged at me in a gallop. He knew how fast to come by how shrill and sharp I whistled. He snorted once at the wolf carcass as he passed, then thundered to a stop beside me. I patted his head and hugged his neck. “Good boy, Crimson. That was fast. Someday you might even beat Diamond.” Crimson tossed his head and snorted again, as if he knew I was daring to compare him with Pierre’s horse. I led him back to his stall with my hand on his back, as he shook twice. 95 “I know,” I said, petting him. “I know you’re angry about the wolf. But it’s not the thing that killed your mother. It’s just a wolf, and it’s dead. And someday we’ll figure out how to get rid of those things, whatever they are. All right? We’ll make sure they never hurt anyone again.” After removing both of their saddles, I drew Crimson’s water and petted him some more, wishing I could ease his mind. He continued to stamp and fidget, glancing back at the stable entrance twice. As if the wolf could rise from Mama’s work table and attack us. I kept petting him. “It’s all right. You’re safe with me now. And I won’t let anything hurt you, ever again.” I continued to smooth his mane and his neck, and he breathed easier. Then he perked up and glanced at the entrance. Papa stood there within the stable, his hands at his sides. The pipe smoldered silently from his hip. His mustached face was in shadow within the waning light and I couldn’t see his features. “If you wish to hunt, you must do exactly as I say, without question. You will step where I tell you to step. You will keep silent when I tell you to keep silent. You will shoot when I tell you to shoot. Whatever I tell you to do, you cannot hesitate. Understood?” I shuddered. “Yes, Papa.” He stood there, a husky shadow, as if we stood in someone’s tomb. “You’ll rise early tomorrow. As soon as you finish your chores, we’ll head into the woods.” 96 The woods. Where the black wolf spoke to me. Where it watched and waited for me as I hurried to Grand’Mere’s house. “… yes, Papa.” His shadow nodded, then brought the smoldering pipe to his lips and strode back to the house. I stood there, frozen. I petted Crimson again, my fingers trembling against him. “You see? I told you. There’s nothing to worry about. We’re going to learn how to hunt, and then we won’t have to be afraid of anything anymore.” I laid my head against his, wondering how I would make myself sleep tonight. “Everything’s going to be all right, Crimson, I promise,” I said. “Tomorrow morning, we’re going back into the woods.” 97 98 99 MY RISE 100 101 11. I smiled and patted Crimson’s neck as Papa and Royale led us out of the dark forest. The large buck I had shot scraped through pine needles on the ground behind Royale, tied to his saddle. It was my twelfth deer since we had started hunting over a year ago. Papa kept glancing back at it, beaming. He said this one was bigger than any animal he had ever killed. Before we mounted the horses to head home, he actually chuckled and clapped me on the back. 102 Sunlight glinted through the trees, now in full bloom, their leaves still wet with mist and mountain fog. I closed my eyes a moment. I no longer minded feeling the sun on my triple-scarred face. The long days of summer were just a month away, when we could stay outside longer, riding and hunting. I unfastened the side holster of Crimson’s saddle, which held Papa’s crossbow. He had given me his old weapon from the war to use for hunting, until I was ready to borrow his musket. But I never felt the need to switch. I loaded a bolt and hung the crossbow’s front end down over my right shoe as we rode. I looped its front strap over my toe and yanked up tight, feeling my firm bicep muscle twitch as I locked the bolt into place. “What are you doing back there, Helena?” Papa asked, not bothering to look. “Keeping myself ready.” I could hear the smile in his voice, as he relaxed in the saddle and took in the view of the fir and pine trees. He had trained me to stay prepared, to watch for signs of danger, to survive against predators in the forest. He hardly asked me questions anymore while we hunted, but whenever he did, I answered correctly. “Ready for what?” he asked. “Anything.” He chuckled again. “Exactly, sweetheart. Exactly.” I sat taller in the saddle, enjoying the easy ride home, the gentle breeze on my face, and the sounds of the waking forest. When we had started 103 hunting, every rustling leaf or calling bird made me flinch. I had tripped over my dress several times trying to cross a stream or climb over large rocks. I lost three slippers in the mud before Papa built me a pair of wooden shoes. I wanted boots like his, but we could hardly afford a second pair, just to train a girl how to hunt. The first few months, I didn’t have the strength to even arm the crossbow, let alone shoot straight. When I did shoot, I was terrified. Afraid of missing and afraid of killing. “Shove your fear aside,” Papa had told me. “Shove it aside and shoot.” I followed all of his instructions, as I had promised. No matter how pointless or exhausting it seemed. No matter how many bruises and cuts and open blistering sores my mother had to clean off of me later. Until I learned to clean them myself. Over the last eighteen months, I had grown stronger, faster and stealthier. I learned to measure the landscape before entering it, to avoid snapping twigs or slipping on a muddy patch of ground. A few months ago, I finally developed the strength to arm my crossbow from the saddle, something even a boy my age would struggle to do. I enjoyed my new strength, to help Papa lift a deer carcass from the ground. To chase Valiant through the meadow for several minutes before I started breathing heavily. And to carry two large buckets of water from the nearby well, though Papa still watched me travel the whole distance, resting on the porch with his musket ready. 104 But he allowed me more and more freedom and asked me to help with more chores. I turned eleven last month, and I had developed strength and skills to rival that of most boys. Strength to survive. As we broke through the trees to enter our meadow, Valiant barked from his place beside the sheep pen and ran to meet us. Mama watched from the stoop as we approached. She didn’t stand like she usually did, but kept sewing. My kill today would catch her attention. I led Crimson to trot over to her, beaming as Papa and I dismounted to untie the deer. Together, we dragged it to the carving table and hoisted it up. The heavy buck’s antlers cracked as it struck the oak surface in a heap. Mama’s nose wrinkled as if a skunk had sprayed us. “A good hunt?” she asked. I spread my hands toward the enormous deer and smiled, saying nothing more. Valiant barked, as if voicing his agreement. “Come inside and wash up,” Mama said. “Your father can clean the deer.” “It’s a large one,” he said. “I would like some help to –.” “I want a few moments to speak with Helena.” Papa gaped. Mama rarely dared to interrupt him. He bent to retrieve the cleaver that the deer’s carcass had knocked to the ground, wiped it on his tunic, and set to work. They must have agreed beforehand on whatever Mama wished to discuss. I couldn’t tell if it might be good or bad news, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t afraid anymore. 105 Of anything. Then she led me inside and told me she was going to have a baby. 106 12. “Can’t catch me!” Suzette giggled, dodging this way and that through our meadow. Her wooly blanket trailed behind, clutched in her tiny fist as she ran her hardest in the waning sunlight. “Oh, I’ll catch you!” I laughed back, stepping sideways to block her escape. “Or I will!” Pierre said, rushing to her other side. Suzette squealed as Valiant ran around us all, barking. We pretended my four-year old sister was too fast and agile for two fifteen-year olds to grab. We reached for her, missing each time, 107 which made her laugh harder. “Come here, you!” I demanded in a playful tone. “No!” she called, her short legs turning awkwardly to hurry away. Pierre was better at pretending. He kept jumping right next to Suzette, while Valiant barked around his ankles to make sure he wasn’t harming her. Then he would nearly snatch the back of her cotton dress before his fingers closed on empty air. “Missed again! I can’t believe it!” “Too bad for you!” Suzette called. I leaped in front of her as she turned away from the bare trees of the forest. She shrieked and retreated as Pierre barred her escape in the other direction. Then I landed behind her and seized the trailing end of her blanket. “My woolie!” She grinned and grunted as she tugged at her blanket, refusing to let go. I dragged her closer and scooped her into the air. “We got her!” Pierre called. He knelt down to pet Valiant, who had started to growl. “Got you by your fuzzy woolie!” I said. I knew she wouldn’t release it. Mama made it for her two years ago and Suzette had held tight to it ever since, the way I used to guard my red cloak. She struggled to pull free. “Lemme go! And gimme my fuzzy woolie or I’ll beat your head! Nngh!” Her tiny fingers tried to pry my arm loose. Until I turned her around and held her against my chest. Then she threw her blanket over my shoulder, flung her arms around my neck and held on tight. “Take me for a big ride.” 108 “All right, hang on!” I trotted like a horse, running in small circles around the chilly meadow, while Pierre ruffled Valiant’s fur. Suzette giggled as I bounced her up and down. Crimson snorted at us from the sheep pen, where he had been trotting. I had trained him to stay close by, even when he wasn’t hitched up, to show Papa how well we could take care of ourselves. Crimson appreciated the freedom, but now he seemed eager to join us. Winter was coming, and he wouldn’t have many days left to gallop before being cooped up in the barn until springtime. “No, no!” Suzette said, laughing. “Take me for a big ride on Crimson!” I whirled her around in the air and plopped her down on her feet. Crimson paced before the sheep pen like a guard dog, stealing glances at us. I bent toward Suzette and lowered my voice. “You know we can’t ride very long.” “I know, I know,” she said with a frown. She rolled her eyes and made a stern face like Papa’s. “‘It’s almost dark, girls. We don’t wanna be caught out after dark.’” “That’s right,” I said, stifling a smile. “But we can gallop twice around the meadow if you want.” She shook her head and leaned toward me with a wicked grin. “Let’s go scare all the sheeps,” she said. I glanced sideways at our empty front porch. “… I don’t know.” 109 “Aw, come on! Papa won’t hear us. They’ve been talking in there for days!” “More like an hour.” “Don’t know about what?” Pierre asked. I curled my lip. “Suzette wants to scare the sheep.” Pierre raised an eyebrow. “You told me what he said last time you did that.” “They probably won’t even hear us from the house,” I suggested. “Probably not,” he agreed. “Mama could probably keep your mother talking all night, if she wanted.” “I like Madame Lisette,” Suzette said, curling her arms around her blanket. “She plays with me.” “I like her, too,” I said. I cocked my head at Pierre. “You call her ‘Mama’?” He shrugged. “Sure. She’s been my stepmother over a year now.” “But you still miss your mother?” “Yeah,” he said, nodding sideways at the house. “But she’s my mother now.” “I suppose.” “Will you guys stop talking about mothers and start scaring the sheeps?” Suzette demanded, jamming her fists on her hips. We laughed. “Sorry, Suzette.” “What were we thinking?” Pierre said. He glanced at the porch for any sign of movement. “Just be careful, Red.” 110 “How come you always call Helena ‘Red’?” Suzette asked. “Is it ‘cause of her scratches on her face? ‘Cause that’s not nice.” Pierre shuddered. “Uh, no. Of course not. It’s because, uh …” I put up a hand. “She’s just curious.” I bent toward Suzette. “It’s because I used to wear a red cloak all the time, Suzette. When I was around your age.” “But you don’t anymore. So how come he calls you that still?” I smiled. “Some things just stick with you.” Suzette waved me off. “All right, fine. You can be ‘Red’. Let’s just scare the sheeps.” “All right, Silly.” I whistled for Crimson. He galloped straight at us. I peered around his flank to eye the porch once more. Pierre looked over his shoulder from the grass as he kept Valiant still. It always felt so peaceful when the Leónes came to visit. Monsieur Leóne seemed content with Madame Leóne, who was as good a seamstress as Mama. Their wedding two summers ago brought us a breath of fresh air, after years of gloom. Nearly as refreshing as the day Suzette was born. Signs of new life, that people could start over. And Pierre seemed even happier than usual since the wedding. Over the last few years he had grown stronger, a few inches taller, and far more confident. He had become highly skilled as a blacksmith’s apprentice, but he never even talked about it unless someone needed his assistance. He 111 treated all of our animals well, and he was wonderful for Suzette. I couldn’t think of a single day when he had failed to make her smile. I lifted Suzette onto Crimson’s back and placed her in front of the saddle. She sucked on her blanket as I hoisted myself up behind her. “Hold on tight,” I said. I wrapped my arm around her and she coiled her tiny arms around mine. Then she squealed as I urged Crimson forward and we charged at the sheep pen. The sheep heard us thundering at them and paused, searching all around for the source of the tremors. Spotting us, a few of them panicked and nearly stumbled sideways over one another, while the others kept chewing on their straw. “Run! Run, sheeps!” Suzette cried. “We’re gonna get you, sheeps!” “HELENA!” I yanked on the reins. Crimson skidded to a halt. I clutched Suzette so tight I feared I might cut off her air. Instead of wheezing, she laughed. I sat up and turned toward Papa’s booming voice. Pierre clenched his teeth, wincing at me. “Yes, Papa?” I asked in a quiet voice. Papa stood on the porch, his face flushed around his black frown of a moustache. “What on earth are you doing? You trying to give them a heart attack?” “Papa, the sheeps are so really funny!” Suzette giggled. 112 His face darkened. “They won’t be so really funny if they’re dead.” “But, Papa! You should’ve seen how the sheeps –!” I nudged her. “Hush, Suzette. Trust me, he knows.” Papa continued to glower at us, until even Crimson looked away. “Helena, I suggest you show more care around our flock, if you plan to join me on the hunt tomorrow.” “When can I go on a hunt?” Suzette asked. “I wanna go on a hunt tomorrow, too.” Papa blinked. “When you’re much older.” “I’m much older now. I just turned four. That’s as old as Helena was when it was the first time she hunted.” “I was nine,” I told her. “So? I’m almost nine, too.” I smiled. “Four is not almost nine. Or even close.” She soured and looked away. “Well, it is to me.” “All right, girls, get inside,” Papa said, waving us into the house. “It’s almost dark. We don’t want to be caught out after dark.” I tightened my lips to hold in a laugh. “Papa!” Suzette called, laughing out loud. “We were just saying –!” “Hush, Suzette!” I told her. “Let’s get Crimson bedded and go inside.” I dismounted and lifted Suzette down, then led Crimson to the stable. It was one of the few times I had to take his reins. He didn’t like being 113 cooped up in the stable, and I hated leaving him there, out in the open air. At least we had a lock on the door. Pierre joined us with a guilty smile. “Sorry, Red. I was watching you and Suzette ride and suddenly he was right there.” Valiant barked at Pierre’s heels, as if supporting his claim. “He has a way of doing that. It’s all right. Papa will forget about it eventually.” He entered the dusty stable with us. I unsaddled Crimson and stroked his neck to calm him, like always. Crimson fidgeted and kept checking Royale’s stall, as if making certain the horse was still there. “Is he always this agitated at night?” Pierre asked. I kept stroking Crimson, speaking in soft tones. “I don’t think he ever got over being trapped in Francois’ stall when the wolves came. He couldn’t do anything to stop it. Just had to stay there and watch, while they –.” I glanced down at Suzette. “Well, Francois’ mare, Lightning, was his mother.” “Helena, how come I can’t hunt? I’ll be good. I wanna be like you.” “Oh, you do?” Pierre bent down beside her. “You wanna shoot rabbits from fifty feet away like Red?” I blushed. “Pierre. That was only one time.” He ignored me and dropped to one knee, spreading his hands to make it more dramatic. “Your papa told me about it,” he said as Suzette 114 sucked on her blanket. “He and Red were out early one morning and they spied this rabbit way up ahead, moving behind an oak tree. They didn’t want to move any further or the horses would’ve scared it off. So they stood there, drawing their weapons. Your papa’s musket and Red’s crossbow.” “It’s actually Papa’s crossbow, from the war, actually,” Suzette told him. She learned the word “actually” last month and now used it whenever she could. “Sure, I know. Anyway, they were about fifty feet away, too far to get a good shot, so they were gonna creep up closer. Your papa took one step forward, real quiet. Then something spooked the rabbit. Maybe he sensed they were there, I don’t know. But he took off running and your papa figured they had lost it. But while he was thinking that, Red drew her crossbow in a flash. She fired one shot, straight at the rabbit, and sent it flying into a tree behind it. One shot. Fifty feet away. It was amazing. Your papa came bragging about it the same day at my papa’s shop, kept telling it to everybody who would listen. Some folks didn’t believe him, but I’ve heard plenty of other stories about Red’s hunting, so I know it’s true. She’s a better hunter than any of the men in town, but nobody wants to admit it.” “All right, Pierre, that’s enough,” I said, my cheeks burning. “Don’t fill her head with stories.” “Well, it’s true.” 115 I sighed, not wanting to discuss the details with both of them together. “It wasn’t exactly fifty feet.” “No?” “No,” I said firmly. I turned away, keeping my smile to myself. By Papa’s measure from the trees where we stood, it was fifty-eight. Actually. “Well, it’s still an impressive shot, Red. One of many.” His eyes lit up and he turned back to Suzette. “Your papa told me about another time when they –!” “Pierre, no more hunting stories. It’s time to settle down for the night.” “I like Pierre’s hunting stories!” Suzette complained. “How come I can’t go hunt with you and Papa, just for one time?” I stroked Crimson’s neck, as his eyes darted back and forth at the stable’s confining walls. Yes, how come? I wondered. Like Papa always said, we needed to be ready. Ready for anything. Pierre felt I could handle myself well enough. But what about Suzette? Who would protect her when the wolves came? I hugged Crimson’s neck, my fingers brushing back his mane as he gradually relaxed. “I’ll talk to Papa,” I said. “No promises.” Suzette’s whole face brightened. “Yay! I’m gonna be like you!” Pierre stood, looking pleased with himself. I hoisted Suzette into my arms. “Well, I want to be like you,” I said, stepping outside. She started one of her silly songs. “I wanna be like you, and you wanna be like me. And we 116 wanna be like Crimson. And Crimson wants to be a tree.” I set her down to close the stall door and lock it. “I doubt Crimson wants to be a tree.” “He has to. ‘Cuz that’s what rhymes.” “Why don’t we let Crimson be whatever he wants.” She ignored me and started up again, dancing in a circle. “And Crimson wants to be a tree. Or a butterfly. Or a frog. And Pierre likes to call you ‘Red’. ‘Cuz you blush when he’s around – !” “Shush!” I scolded her in a sharp voice. “Well, you do. Go see your face. It’s all –.” “‘Quiet’, I said. It’s almost time for bed.” “No, it’s not, either. I can –!” “Shush,” I told her, picking her up again to settle her. Suzette grumbled and sucked on her blanket, while Pierre tightened his lips, looking amused. I forced an awkward smile. “… She’s four.” He nodded with a grin. We heard a horse approaching. Shadowed against the setting sun, Father Vestille trotted toward our stoop on his gray Palomino. My gut went hollow. “Hello, Helena! Pierre! Suzette!” “Father Vestille!” Suzette squirmed like a fish until I set her down. She ran at Father Vestille, waving her blanket. He climbed down from his saddle and scooped her up. “Oh, you’re so heavy!” he joked. “How much candy have you eaten today?” 117 She giggled. “I’m not heavy, neither, Father Vestille.” He held her over his head and twirled her about. The same way he did with me, when I was only a child. “I can barely lift you!” he said. Suzette squealed, Pierre laughed, and Valiant barked. As I stood rigid, watching them. “Time to get inside, Suzette,” I said at last. “Awww.” Father Vestille stopped, surprised. He managed a smile and set her down. “Your sister’s right. Sorry I’m visiting so late in the day.” “Abier! How are you?” Papa appeared on the porch, with Mama and the Leónes behind him. He marched at Father Vestille and gave him a strong embrace. “How have you been, Henri?” They broke apart, looking a bit awkward. “We didn’t know when you’d be back,” Papa said. “Neither did I. I wanted to let you know I’ll be here this Sunday.” “We still gather.” Papa nodded toward the smiling group on the porch. “I’ve been leading prayers. Last weekend we discussed showing honor to the King, in spite of any rumors and misgivings.” He smiled sheepishly. “It was a humbling experience.” Father Vestille laughed and clapped him on the back. “You’re a good man, Henri. There’s no one I would rather have leading prayers when I’m away.” “Come inside. Have some wine.” They started toward the house. 118 “Only a little. I want to be up early tomorrow, visit some people in the village. I just got back and came here first.” “Why are we so special?” I asked. Papa and Father Vestille stopped where they stood. Everyone gaped at me. Father Vestille gave me his kindest eyes, the ones I remembered from years ago. “Because there’s no one I care more about than you and your family, Helena.” I said nothing. Just stared back at him. Mama stepped down from the porch and extended a hand toward him. “Come on in. Lisette brought over some fresh bread. She’s trying to convince me to start a clothing business together.” Father Vestille smiled. “You should. Between the two of you, you could already supply nearly half the dresses of the village.” Mama laughed. Madame Leóne stuck her hands on her hips with a clever grin. “Well, Father Vestille, most women won’t buy half a dress.” Everyone laughed, including Pierre, making Valiant bark again. I stiffened and waited for everyone to go inside. “Madame Lisette!” Suzette called, running to her. “Madame Suzette!” Madame Leóne smiled and squatted down. “How may I be of service?” Madame Leóne was beautiful like Mama, but in a different way. Although a few years older, she always looked radiant, her eyes crinkling at the corners with constant humor. 119 “I want you and Mama to make a special hunting dress ‘cuz I’m gonna go hunting with Helena!” Papa glared at me. So much for easing into the conversation. But he didn’t scold me. He only wrinkled his brow as he continued past Mama, who gaped at me from the porch. “Oh, a special hunting dress,” Madame Leóne said, playing along. “How about a little more blueberry pie instead?” “No! I wanna have my special hunting dress!” “Well, we’ll have to see about that with your Mama and Papa, I think. Come on inside.” Yes, we will, I thought as the adults meandered into the house. Pierre lingered outside a moment with me. Madame Leóne regarded him, then gave me a sly wink before ushering Suzette inside with a hand at her back. Mama threw a smiling glance at me before following them inside. I shook my head at their overactive imaginations. Pierre shoved his hands in his trouser pockets. “How come you’re mad at Father Vestille?” I turned and started walking away, past the bleating sheep. “Who said I’m mad?” “You did, with everything you’re doing. Figured you’d start throwing rocks at him next.” I didn’t want to talk about it. “We used to be close, when I was little,” I said. “Then I grew up. That’s it.” 120 “Red.” He stopped walking and faced me. “You act like he stole your horse. What did he do that’s so horrible?” I stiffened, wanting to turn away yet wanting to answer him. I knew I could still talk to Pierre about anything. Even this. “Nothing,” I said in a feeble voice, feeling myself tremble. “He didn’t do anything. When the wolf attacked, Francois came and killed it. Father Vestille came and helped get me to Doctor Renoire. After that – he stopped coming around.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “He’s at your house all the time.” I shook my head. “He used to visit us every Sunday for lunch and stay until dark. Some weeks he visited us a couple more times. Then the wolf killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me like this, and he started to disappear, making long trips to other provinces. Refusing to tell us where he was or what he was doing or why he had to go. He won’t admit that he’s looking for a better church to lead, in some province that’s not plagued by wolves.” Pierre dug his hands in his pockets and resumed our aimless stroll through the meadow. The sun dipped low, and I expected Papa’s voice to thunder from the front stoop at any moment. Don’t be caught out after dark, Helena. “Doesn’t fit,” Pierre said. “The way he preaches, the way he helps people. He’s been close to your parents since he moved here. Can’t see him moving on to another group of people.” I bit my lip. “Shows how wrong you can be about someone. You think he’ll be there when you 121 really need him. Then when there’s trouble, he’s nowhere around.” “Hmm,” Pierre said. “Well. Glad you’re not mad.” “Look, I just don’t –.” “Easy, Red. I’m teasing you. Will I still see you at Mass Sunday? I can find you a good spot at the back to throw rocks.” “I’ll be there. I can’t tell Mama and Papa I refuse to go. But don’t expect me to listen to anything he says.” Pierre fell silent. “You still pray?” “Of course,” I said. “Every morning and every night. But I haven’t gotten any answers yet.” “You’ve got Suzette, right? I never thought you’d love anything more than that crazy horse of yours. That’s an answer to prayer, isn’t it, having a sister?” I smiled. “Yes. It is.” My heart sank again as I turned toward the dismal forest. “But those things are still out there.” “You mean the wolves?” “They’re not wolves. I heard another lady was attacked a few months ago.” “Yeah, Madame Benoit, the miller’s wife. We went to the funeral.” “Was Father Vestille there?” “Uh, no. He was away. Another priest, Monsieur Benoit’s cousin, came from Dijon to lead the service.” “Hm. Surprising. The one thing Father Vestille rarely misses is a funeral.” 122 “You are really angry at him. Don’t you think you should give him another chance?” I considered that for all of two seconds. “He used to be there for our family. Now he’s not. And I’ve moved on. I needed him back then. I don’t need him now.” Pierre sighed deeply, dropping the subject. “All right. What’re you doing tomorrow?” “Helena!” We turned toward the sound of Papa’s voice, about fifty yards away. I barely noticed how far we had strayed. “Come on back. Pierre’s parents are about to head home and you don’t want to be caught out after dark. And you and I need to talk to your mother about Suzette joining us early tomorrow.” My pulse raced. “Yes, Papa!” I called back. So. He didn’t say that they needed to talk to Suzette, but that the two of us to talk to Mama. “Sounds like I’m going hunting,” I told Pierre. 123 13. The forest was cold and quiet the next morning, hardly a bird left to whistle among the naked branches. But we still hoped to find a few animals roaming about, if we could spot any through the clinging fog. We slowed to a trot and listened for movements. Papa rode ahead on Royale while Suzette sat in front of me on Crimson, clutching her blanket – her “fuzzy woolie”. Still as she was, I kept imagining that her racing heartbeat would frighten off every creature we approached. She had practically bounced up 124 and down when we left the cottage. But Papa instructed her – as he had instructed me on my first hunt – to obey his every command and keep silent in the forest. He put up a hand. I pulled Crimson to a halt. Papa rode Royale a few steps closer, one hoof at a time, his hand still raised to us. Suzette’s pulse thumped against me through her back but she kept still, sucking on her blanket. She would make an excellent hunter one day. As soon as she gave up her fuzzy woolie. My eyes narrowed on the area Papa faced. Then I spotted it: a large white-tailed buck emerging from a cluster of trees, bending to nibble some grass. I might never have noticed it through the dense fog without frightening it away, but Papa had a keen sense for subtle movements. He raised his musket and took aim between the spread antlers. The deer’s head suddenly jerked up as something pounced on top of it. Something large. The enormous shadow spread over the deer, making Suzette scream. I clamped my hand over her mouth as the beast stopped and turned on us. I gasped. It was the wolf, black as night. Its blue-gray eyes stabbed into us as its head rose, as tall as the deer’s neck. The buck staggered to its feet and fled, with the monster chasing it. Papa drove Royale after them. “Papa, stop!” I cried. 125 I tugged on Crimson’s reins. “Hyah!” We galloped after them, my crossbow raised. Suzette squealed and gathered her blanket close to her chest, grasping Crimson’s mane as I goaded him faster. The trees blurred past as I fixed my eyes on Papa and Royale, struggling to keep sight of them rushing through the fog. Ahead of them, I caught shadowy glimpses of the escaping wolf. “Come on, Crimson. Go!” Suzette screamed. “Stop, Helena! Stop!” I ignored her and drove Crimson harder. Royale began to pull away. I barely caught sight of the wolf’s whipping tail. As Crimson leaped over a thick tree root, Suzette slid sideways. She hung from the saddle as we sailed through the air. I yanked on the reins and clutched her to my chest as we toppled over. Crimson fell on my leg like a pile of stones and I screamed. He rose off me instantly, letting my heels slide and fall limply from the stirrups. I lay there and cradled Suzette, trying to stop her from squirming. I bit my lip and waited for feeling to return to my leg. After a few minutes, I managed to calm her down, assuring her I could still walk. My crossbow lay on the ground near my hand. It had fired its bolt when we fell. There was no time to search for it. “Bring me another bolt,” I groaned. Suzette got up quickly, smearing away tears with her blanket. She ran to the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle and returned with a new bolt. I sat on the ground and put my left foot in the crossbow’s loop. I leaned back and tugged 126 the bowstring taut to arm it, thankful to have one strong leg. I crawled to a nearby tree for support and stood to my feet. I limped to Crimson and he nuzzled me with his neck, as I lifted my long skirt to check my injury. The purpling bruise on my thigh and knee would spread over the next few days, but it would heal. A gunshot echoed through the trees. We froze. I grabbed Suzette and lifted her onto Crimson, clenching my teeth against the numbing pain. Gripping the horn tight, I planted my foot in the stirrup and hoisted myself up, swinging my dead leg over his back. Crimson hesitated at first, sensing my injury, but I urged him on and he tore after Papa with all speed. It took less than a minute to reach a clearing where we found the deer. Or rather, its head, ripped from its neck and lying in a pool of blood. There was no body. Near the head, Papa’s musket lay in the dirt, spattered with blood. I blocked Suzette’s eyes with my forearm and stared at Papa’s weapon. Just stared, holding Crimson in position. Unwilling – unable – to move forward. I finally turned Crimson away at a slow canter, leading him and Suzette to some thick brush and trees several yards away. “Wait here.” “Helena. Wasn’t that Papa’s –?” “Wait here, I said!” Suzette sniffed. “Don’t yell.” 127 I cradled her carefully. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to yell. But do as I say. Sit here and keep still.” She sniffed and buried her face in the blanket. “I hate this forest.” I hugged her tight, then swung my leg over the saddle and dropped down. The jarring pain rang all the way from my leg to my neck. I limped all the way back to the clearing to retrieve Papa’s musket. It was still warm. I could smell the gunpowder from its recent shot. He missed shooting whatever attacked him. Or his bullet failed to stop it. Something rustled through the bushes at my left. I dropped the musket and aimed my crossbow at the approaching footsteps. Father Vestille strode from the forest on his Palomino, right into my sight. He flinched as his horse started a little. I lowered the crossbow. “Helena? What –?” “Papa’s missing.” My words came out half-choked. His eyes widened at the bloody musket. He scanned the area. “Which way?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. I didn’t see. Somewhere back that direction.” His face turned to iron. “Take Suzette home and round up some men. Go.” “I’m coming with you.” “Take your sister home!” I bit my lip. I knew he was right. She had already seen too much. But I couldn’t lose the chance to find Papa. 128 I had to trust Father Vestille to find him. I hobbled quickly back to Crimson as Father Vestille galloped off. We raced home, faster than ever. It felt like forever. When we finally reached the cottage, Mama sat waiting on the front stoop, as always. Suzette screamed for her and Mama came running. I left Suzette with her. Suzette babbled, waving her blanket wildly as Mama hugged her tight. Mama turned to me with frantic eyes. “What happened? Where’s your father?” “I don’t know. Father Vestille’s searching for him. I’m going back.” “Helena, wait!” I sped away. I had no time to find more men in the village. Who would I find? Who would listen to me, other than the Leónes? Every moment spent asking for help was another moment lost. We pounded back into the darkness of the forest. A few minutes later, we reached the spot where Father Vestille had met me. I yanked the reins, jarring Crimson to a halt, and listened. Crimson followed my lead and kept still, while my heart beat like a drum. Something wailed. We charged toward it, darting around tree trunks. I ground my teeth, the crossbow in my fist. A dark figure knelt on the ground ahead. Crimson skidded to a halt as I aimed at the man in black. 129 It was Father Vestille, bent over on the ground. Sobbing as he clutched a scarlet cloth to his chest. It was Papa’s tunic. Covered in blood. I smelled the drying puddles of blood scattered throughout the area. I saw pieces of Papa. A scarlet finger. A boot with part of the torn leg still inside. Some piece of indistinguishable flesh lying mangled against a tree trunk. Bile rose at the back of my throat but I stilled it. Crimson snorted and stamped his hooves, sharing my shock and rage. Father Vestille simply wept, doubled over my father’s tunic, rocking back and forth. I searched in all directions, listening, smelling the air. Nothing but pine and decay from my father’s blood. Father Vestille finally rose, clutching Papa’s shirt. He trudged to his horse, hanging his head. His robe covered with Papa’s blood. “We must tell your mother,” he rasped. I kept scanning the trees, kept listening for movement. My grip ached on the crossbow. Something rustled in the bushes. I whirled and fired as a reflex, pinning a small rabbit to the dirt. It let out a pitiful squeal as my bolt pierced its belly. I examined it. Papa would have been impressed by my quick reaction. I studied the rabbit another few seconds. Then bent to grab another bolt from the saddle pouch, loaded it with my left boot, and waited. 130 There were no sounds. Only the bunny’s plaintive cries. No more of Papa’s booming voice, ordering me inside. No more of his smile or his pride in my latest kill. No more of his horsey-rides with Suzette bouncing on his shoulders. No more of his quiet kisses to Mama when he thought we weren’t looking. The forest was still. I dismounted and limped to the rabbit, gritting through the pain. I jammed the bolt deeper and worked it back and forth until the rabbit stopped struggling. I picked it up and tied it to the saddle. “Dinner,” I said as I dragged myself back onto Crimson. “Helena …” Father Vestille began in a broken voice. I met his gaze. “Can’t let good meat go to waste,” I told him, urging Crimson forward. We rode back to the clearing. I pulled Crimson to a halt and climbed down to gather up Papa’s musket. I wiped off some of the blood – Papa’s blood – on my burlap cloak. I cleaned it slowly, thinking about how Papa used his gun. How careful he was in the forest, how quick he was to fire. He must have shot the wolf. But it still killed him. And it still lived, somewhere in the blackness. I secured the musket to Crimson’s saddle beside the hanging rabbit. I mounted, allowing no more tears to start, no time to think. Only to act. I 131 turned at a sudden sound and stared at Father Vestille. “Did you hear that?” He looked about. I had jarred him out of his grief. “I – I don’t know. What did you hear?” I glared at him and wondered if I was going mad. “Perhaps nothing. We should go.” I stared at the path leading out of the forest, setting my jaw. “Don’t want to get caught out after dark.” We turned the horses back to the cottage. But I still felt an unsettling tremor in my spine. I could not possibly have heard what I imagined. Still, I glanced over my shoulder again as we rode toward home. From the dark recesses of the forest, I could have sworn I heard some wild animal laughing. “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” We sat quiet and still in the pew at la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu, listening as Father Vestille gave the eulogy and then prayed over Papa’s body. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The casket was closed. Father Vestille examined it, as though he could see Papa’s face beneath the heavy lid. “Henri Basque – was my dearest friend. A kind man who always looked out for others. Always wanted to provide for others. Protect others. Shelter others. Even in his death, he died protecting his daughters from a dangerous animal as he – as he chased after it.” 132 I sensed people staring at me. I was thankful to have Mama and Suzette beside me, with Pierre and his parents sitting nearby. “Henri and Celeste invited me here after they came and settled, when they saw there had been no priest for several years. They allowed me to stay with them, until I was able to purchase my own hovel. They supported the new church here, attending regularly and helping draw others in. Henri wanted to provide for people’s spiritual needs as well as their material needs. He lived his life providing for others, and he died protecting his daughters.” Mama withdrew one of her embroidered handkerchiefs and dabbed at her bloodshot eyes. She looked too tired to weep anymore. I felt hollow inside as Father Vestille concluded his eulogy. The Mass ended and the casket was carried outside by Monsieur Leóne, Duke Laurent, and four other men. They put thick ropes under the casket and lowered it down into the giant pit. Then they pulled the ropes out and left Papa’s body there. Pierre stood beside me. “Weird.” I said nothing, but waited for him to continue. “I mean, you’re certain your father wouldn’t have missed. But if he hit the wolf, why couldn’t they find it? It couldn’t have gotten far.” I didn’t answer. I just stared into the dark hole. 133 He cleared his throat. “Sorry, Red. I shouldn’t keep talking about the wolves.” He stepped away to join his parents. I stood stiff and unmoving, saying nothing at all. “I’m so sorry, Madame,” Duke Laurent was telling Mama as he led her gently by the hand. “Henri was one of the best men I’ve ever known.” He had a slight catch in his throat. “If there’s anything I can do for your family, please let me know and it will be done.” “That is very kind of you, Monsieur,” Mama said, sounding frail and numb. She turned tired eyes on me. “Helena. Are you ready to go home?” I nodded, wrapped my burlap cloak around my shoulders, and put an arm around Suzette as she clutched her blanket. We returned home in silence. The Leónes stayed with us that afternoon, along with Father Vestille. I know Mama and Suzette needed their company, but apart from Pierre, I was relieved when they all left before dusk. Leaving the house dark and quiet. Mama wanted to talk to me after she put Suzette to bed but I didn’t feel like talking. I didn’t feel like doing anything at all. I retired early and cried myself to sleep. 134 14. “The beast has returned!” I looked up to see Jacque Denue and his four cronies beside the stoop of the Leónes’ blacksmith shop as I exited with my new crossbow bolts. They stood between me and Crimson, hitched to the post. “Told you this was her horse,” Denue said. He jutted his chin at me. “We told you not to come here anymore, you ugly witch. You deaf or just stupid?” 135 “I’ll leave the stupidity to you, Jacque. Step away from my horse.” “What did you say, you hag? Come here and I’ll beat some sense into you.” “Leave me alone. For your own well-being.” Jacque no longer frightened me, and I was in no mood for his nonsense. As a child, I had longed for Papa to rescue me from this brainless bully. Now, six months after Papa’s death, I had learned to take care of myself, along with Mama and Suzette. I had accompanied them in the forest an hour ago, to provide safe escort to Father Vestille’s hovel in the woods. They wanted me to join them for lunch, but I preferred to hunt. I couldn’t tell them I had no interest in visiting with Father Vestille, despite his frequent invitations over the past several months. Even though Mama said he had made a cake to celebrate my sixteenth birthday. He apparently wished to make up for all the time spent away from us, visiting other provinces the last several years. But I wasn’t interested in his penance. My attention had shifted to more important matters. I had assumed the role of hunter and provider for our family. Mama urged me to rest, to spend more time with them, insisting we had plenty of meat, especially with Father Vestille sharing meals with us. But I kept hunting, kept working. And I kept secretly searching for signs of the wolves that took Papa. But I never found them. They seemed to have gone into hiding, as if 136 frightened by the attention that Papa’s death had brought about. After another fruitless search in the woods, I had driven Crimson into the village of La Rue Sauvage to visit Pierre at his shop. I traded a few kills – a rabbit and three birds – for an order of new crossbow bolts, but lingered a few moments afterward. I had to admit, I found it far easier to make time to visit with Pierre. But entering the village brought its own share of risk, as Jacque Denue and his cruel friends meant to remind me. Denue snorted at a fat boy with food stains on his shirt. “Grab her, Port. I’m gonna give this witch a spanking.” The slob snatched at my arm. I dodged him easily and spun toward him, to hammer my locked fists into his face. He went down hard, but the folds of my skirt bunched around my legs, constricting my movements. As I stepped to one side to free up my movements, a taller boy seized my wrist. His fingers locked on me like a vise and jerked me toward Denue. Denue’s breath smelled of chewing tobacco. I tried to yank myself free but my dress remained twisted, keeping me off-balance. “I dunno how you did that, freak, but you’ll be sorry you did. I’m gonna beat you so bad you’ll never show your face outside again!” He raised his fist. Then something knocked his friend into him, forcing a grunt from Jacque as they both sailed to the ground. I tugged myself free of Muscles and stepped aside. 137 Crimson snorted down at the freckle-faced boy who lay sprawled on top of Denue, grimacing as he massaged his ribs. I felt a wave of relief as Crimson tried to kick at the rest of them. But they backed away from the post where I had tied him. I couldn’t get past them to set him loose. Then Slob picked up a rock and hurled it past my head. “Grab her!” Denue growled. Muscles lunged for me. I dodged, still struggling in my long dress. The others bent to pick up rocks, standing between me and Pierre’s door. I could call for help, but then they would throw rocks at Pierre. I hiked up my skirt and sprinted away. I could outrun them, but I had no place to escape between the closely-packed shops and houses. I hurried down an alley, their feet pounding after me. I crossed the next street and nearly fell beneath the wheels of an approaching carriage. The driver spotted me and jerked on the reins. Behind me, Denue and the others were closing in. I stood and ran to knock on the carriage door, seeing a young family inside. The woman saw my scarred face and screamed. “Please! Help me!” I cried. The man blinked and gaped as the woman pulled a small boy close. Over my shoulder, I glimpsed Jacque Denue and his friends charging toward me. I hurried past the coach and down the next alley. A rock sailed past me, missing my head and striking a wine barrel. 138 “Hey, now, stop that, you boys!” the driver called from behind. But he remained in his high seat as the boys’ feet skittered across the cobbled path. I rushed down the next busy street. “Help!” I called, to anyone who would listen. “Help me!” They all backed away, startled by my manner and my appearance. Men, women, children, all dressed well, all strong and healthy, stepped clear of me. Clearing a path for the boys to chase after me, shouting their threats. “We’re coming for you, Scars!” Jacque sang. “We’re gonna kill you!” one of his friends shouted. I ducked into another alley and glanced over my shoulder. The boys grinned like demons, sprinting after me with rocks in their fists. Ahead of me, the alley was bricked in. I gasped and turned, searching for a way out. I grabbed onto an upper ledge and tried to scale the wall. But my skirt made it impossible. “Trapped like a rat,” Denue said. His gang filled the mouth of the alley. “More like a scar-faced pig, I’d say,” Slob chimed in. Denue tossed a rock up and down in his palm. “This’ll help you remember to keep your ugly face out of our village, Scars.” He hurled it at me. I ducked and it struck the brick wall. Muscles threw another one. I dodged and jumped behind a wine barrel. I sat with my back to it, like a child hiding in a cellar. 139 “Come on out, Scars,” Denue demanded. “Come get your punishment.” Their footsteps strolled closer, taking their time. They threw another rock at the wall to frighten me. Which meant they had gathered enough of them to waste a few. My breath came in rapid gasps. I suddenly remembered the black wolf looming over me, mocking me. Knowing I could do nothing to stop it. Until Francois charged in with his ax and struck it dead. Shove your fear aside, Papa’s voice reminded me, the day I made my first kill. Shove it aside and shoot. I tried not to imagine the boys’ rocks striking my gut. My head. My face. I remembered the voice of my other hero, Francois. You gotta stand up and do something, or nobody’s ever gonna get helped, he had urged. Stand up and do something. I looked around the empty alley, at the shrapnel of rocks and bricks scattered nearby. A broken wood plank lay among them. I seized it with both hands. I rose. The boys stared with surprise and delight. Denue hurled his rock at my eyes. I slapped it away with the plank and marched at them. Marched at Denue. The others fell silent and stopped. Muscles threw another stone. I smacked it against the wall and it shattered in half. Freckles hurled another one. I slammed it to the ground. 140 “Throw it!” Denue ordered the others. “Gimme the rock, then!” Slob surrendered his stone to Denue as I closed in. He tried to throw it but I smacked his wrist with the plank. He yelped as I jammed the end of the board into his chest and drove him back out of the alley with his friends. We emerged on the open street and I whacked him across the shoulder. He fell to the ground and rolled onto his back. I dropped to my knees in front of him, releasing the plank. The others gaped as I pummeled him with my fists. I continued with single-handed blows, one after the other. Until he lay on the ground, bloody and crying. I stopped. He cringed and whimpered beneath me, shielding his face with open palms. I could have beaten him into a helpless mass, the way he beat me all those years ago. But what would be the point? I stood to my feet. “You’re not the one I want. Just keep out of my way.” I stepped over him and marched back to Monsieur Leóne’s shop. Denue called after me, half-threatening, half-sobbing. “You freak! You’ll regret this, you scar-faced witch! You’ll regret this!” I ignored him. He was flesh and blood, like me. Beneath his savage surface, he was as frightened as the rest of us. I wanted the wolves. I returned to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and the post where I had left Crimson. He 141 snorted and stamped his feet until I released him and stroked his neck. The fire in his eye matched my own. If he had been free to fight, those boys could never have chased me. “I don’t think I’ll tie you up again, friend.” Crimson snorted. I think he understood. 142 15. Something disturbed my senses as I rode through the woods near our cottage. Something in the air. When we emerged from the forest, I understood. All of our sheep lay strewn about our meadow, turned on their sides, unmoving. A gentle breeze from our yard had carried the stench of their drying blood. I urged Crimson forward and he charged toward the house. The front door stood open, as if gaping in shock. No sheep were bleating, and a 143 glance told me that a few of them had likely run off, or been carried away. Those that remained lay in puddles of blood. Valiant lay beside them in his own scarlet stream. My crossbow was already out and loaded for our trip through the woods. I held it high as I leaped down from the saddle. In my hurry, my foot caught in the stirrup and I stumbled to the ground beside the carving table. I scrambled to my feet and ran inside. Pots and pans, clothing and half-cooked food, were scattered everywhere and stained with blood. Mama’s rocking chair lay in splintered fragments on the floor to my left. I smelled Mama’s stew bubbling in its pot on the cast-iron stove. I let it boil. Wind whistled through the house from the half-open rear door. Against the doorframe, a thick smear of blood was spread like tar. My throat went dry. On the floor beneath lay a large shred of Mama’s dress. I ran to it, clutched the fabric to my chest. I raised the crossbow high and kicked the back door open. Splotches of blood formed a trail from the rear stoop, across the grass behind the cottage, continuing toward the stable. Crimson cantered around the cottage to meet me, drawn by the noise at the back door. He noted my intensity and looked to one side, perhaps wondering what I was tracking. He sniffed at the blood and snorted, 144 sounding angry. I followed the scarlet trail to the stable entrance and hurried inside. The mess was everywhere. The walls, the posts, the hay, the troughs. All matted with thick blood. Most of it had collected in Royale’s stall. I moved toward it slowly, trembling. Within the stall, Royale’s saddle lay on its side. Strands of hay stuck to the blood that coated it. Beyond the stall, the rest of my mother’s dress lay in a sickening pile of straw and dark blood. Crimson stood back and stamped his hooves. My legs felt like melting wax as I stepped closer. I found her jewelry and one of her shoes. Nothing more. She had been taken naked, along with Papa’s horse. They had taken everything from us. Everything. Beside Mama’s abandoned dress lay a hand. A tiny skeletal hand. I fell to my knees before it. My crossbow fell to the hay. It landed on something soft and red, but it didn’t sink through the way it would have sunk into straw. I reached into the inky blood that coated the fabric and lifted it slowly. The blood clung to it and wouldn’t let go. It was her blanket. Her fuzzy woolie. I felt the moan gathering in my gut before it reached my throat and became a wail. Suzette. “Celeste! Suzette!” It was Father Vestille’s voice, calling from somewhere near the front of the cottage. I considered calling out to him from the stable. To come find my family’s remains. 145 My mouth would only whimper. Father Vestille’s feet kicked up a flurry of dust as he skidded into the stable. He gaped at me as I knelt beside Royale’s stall, next to the dress and my sister’s hand, holding her bloody blanket. He stood at the entrance beside Crimson, his chest heaving. “Helena. What – happened?” I didn’t answer. He knew what happened. Anyone seeing this would know. But just like Father Vestille, no one would admit to knowing. A wolf howled nearby. Dark rage surged through me and lifted me to my feet. I snatched up Papa’s crossbow and ran past Father Vestille. “Helena, wait!” He ran after me with Crimson trotting along behind. At the edge of the forest, barely hidden among the trees, a wolf stood. Stood. I had not imagined it. The monster stood on its hind legs, even now, and grinned. Mocking me from the woods. I lunged toward it. Father Vestille tackled me and pinned me to the ground. “Helena, no!” He held me down with his full weight, pressing me into the dirt. I strained to rise. To strike at the beast. To fire a bolt into its belly and turn that smile into a grimace of agony. I finally pushed Father Vestille off and rolled aside. I ran at the wolf as it turned to lope away. I heard it laugh as it fled – actually laugh – in a sort of whooping cackle. 146 I charged at the spot where it had stood. I squinted for a sign of its vanishing tail while Father Vestille chased after me. “Stop, Helena, stop!” Crimson galloped from behind me and clomped to a halt, blocking my path. Doing what Father Vestille could not do. Stopping me from rushing straight to my own death. Father Vestille soon reached us. Crimson snorted at me and I stood there, struggling to control my rage. To focus it. Father Vestille wheezed and bent over, his hands on his knees. He wasn’t used to sprinting. “Helena, please,” he gasped. “There’s nothing – you can do.” I stared through tree after dark tree, tracing the wolf’s likely path. “Not yet.” He hung his head. “Helena –.” “You saw it, Father. It stood.” “Stood?” he wheezed. “What, the wolf? No, Helena, no. It must have – must have simply appeared that way – from a distance.” Swallowing, he gathered his breath and straightened. “Helena. We’ll – We can clean up – your cottage. I’ll help – restore it.” He sounded as though he meant to convince himself as much as to console me. “There’s nothing to restore. They took my home. They’ve taken everything.” His eyes narrowed. “Who has taken everything?” “The wolves.” 147 He said nothing at first. He simply stood there, slowing his breathing, studying me. “Helena. You have a home. With me. I’ll stay here if you wish. Or you can come to my hovel. I’ll see to all your needs.” My breath came evenly as I watched the empty woods. The dark forest of wolves that had swallowed up Mama and Suzette. I had to stay angry to keep from screaming. “That’s very kind of you. But I’ll see to my own needs.” The wind whistled between us. “I know you can fend for yourself, Helena. But we all have needs besides food and shelter. Your father and – your mother – they were my closest friends, since before you were born. And you and Suzette …” His voice caught in his throat. “Helena, your family meant everything to me. I will not abandon you. Nor will I let you abandon yourself.” I stood like a statue before the woods. As a child, I always saw Father Vestille as a source of assurance and comfort. But there was no comfort here at the forest’s edge. I scanned its endless blackness for signs of movement. Any signs of the wolf or its companions. Nothing. I turned from it and strode to Crimson, climbing onto his back. I snapped at the reins and galloped past Father Vestille without a word. I returned to the village and rode straight to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. When I threw the 148 door open, Pierre seemed delighted to see me twice in the same day. Then his face fell. “Red? What’s wrong?” “Can I sleep here tonight?” “Of course, Red. We’ll make some room for you in the loft. What happened?” I tried to speak clearly. My voice rattled. “There was an attack. On – our cottage. Mama and Suzette – They’re gone.” The color drained from his face. “Suzette? How –? What happened?” “The wolves. They took my – The wolves took them. They’re gone. Can I sleep here tonight?” “Yes. Sure, I said you could. Just – sit over here. Did anyone else see it?” I walked to the stool he offered, brushed sawdust from it, and sat. Like a horse being led to its stable, without thought or will or emotion. “Father Vestille was there. He’s – He’s been helping out, looking in on us more often, since Papa died. He wants me to stay with him.” Pierre waited for more. “But you don’t want to. Why not?” I pressed my lips tight, feeling my blood boil again. “Red, what is it? Why are you so mad at him?” “Because he did nothing!” I burst. “Grand’Mere died and he did nothing. Francois died and he did nothing. Papa died and he couldn’t stop the wolf, couldn’t even find it. And now –!” I 149 couldn’t speak their names again. Couldn’t say again that I had lost everyone. Even Suzette. “But – he’s trying to –.” “Please, Pierre. Don’t tell me what he’s trying to do. Please don’t tell me people are trying to help, or that the King will send soldiers, or that everything will be all right, because it won’t. Nothing is going to be all right, ever again.” “Red …” I fell into his arms and clung to him. I needed someone who could understand and let me lean against him and cry. Someone who wouldn’t look down on me for my weakness or my irresponsibility or my ugliness. Someone who would let me cry, and never reveal it to anyone if I asked him. I buried my wet cheeks against his chest and sobbed in gulps, craving his comfort. He held me until I finished, then gently released me as I pulled away. He gave me a crooked smile and offered me a rag, beating some sawdust from it. I took it gratefully and wiped my eyes and nose. “This never happened.” He wrinkled his brow. “The hug?” “No. The crying.” “… Why?” “I don’t want anyone to know. And I don’t want to remember.” “Everyone cries, Red.” “I’ve cried enough. I’m through crying.” He narrowed his eyes, not sure what to make of me. “Listen, Red. I’ll let Papa know you’re here and tell him what happened. You’re 150 welcome to stay. I’ll make up the cot for you upstairs and get some blankets so you can rest.” I nodded obediently, feeling numb. As if all the emotion had been drained from my soul. At least, all the emotion I could reveal. My rage, my fear, the storm building inside me – I had to keep these reined in, lest they be fully unleashed. “Let me just add some more wood,” he said, stepping to the large center furnace and grabbing a poker to pull open its grate. A blast of light and heat emitted from within. “You sure you need more fire in there?” I asked dully. He grinned at me over his shoulder. “It’s supposed to storm tonight. Never know when you might need some extra heat.” He chucked a couple of logs into the opening, letting the mighty blaze roar at us before he shut the grate again. He lit a lantern and strode past it to the ladder at the rear of the shop. I followed him up to the loft with wooden movements. We emerged through the square opening. Pierre’s lantern lit the long-forgotten room in a dusty haze. Cobwebs connected the enormous wardrobe on the far wall to a standing mirror, covered in a dusty film. Near the shuttered window stood a cot. I longed to collapse onto it and sleep for hours, as Pierre suggested. My mind and strength were spent. He set the lantern on the nightstand and clomped to the wardrobe, his boots leaving footprints in the floorboard dust as I sneezed twice. 151 He opened the double doors, peeling cobweb strings apart, and bent to lift two thick blankets from a bottom shelf. Among the coats and dresses that hung above the blankets, something flashed a brilliant red. I stepped to the wardrobe and pushed the other garments aside. Behind coats, nightshirts and tunics, covered with dust and age, hung a long red hooded cloak. Just like the one Grand’Mere Marie made for me when I was little. The cloak I was forbidden to wear after the attack. I pulled it out. “That was Mama’s,” Pierre said. I kept staring at it. “Sorry,” I mumbled. “No, it’s all right. It’s beautiful, I know. Like the one you used to – uh, here. You should be warm enough with these.” The hood and cloak looked roomy, slightly too large for me. But they would fit. “I want this.” Pierre turned to me. “Huh? Oh. Sure, I’ll ask Papa. No one’s using it, so it shouldn’t be –.” “I want this,” I repeated. “I’ll give you anything you want for it.” “Red, you can have it. But you should get some rest.” I couldn’t take my eyes off the cloak. The red hooded cloak. I had not worn anything red since before I started hunting. Since the wolves took all peace and happiness from our lives. Now they had taken our lives, too. Grand’Mere and Francois and my parents. Even Suzette. For the first time, I had known some of the joy my mother 152 always wanted for me. To feel like a mother, or at least a big sister. And they had taken it away. I clutched the cloak to my chest. Then I moved to the cot. “I’ll use this as well. To keep warm.” “All right,” Pierre allowed. I sat on the cot. “Father Vestille will plan a service for my mother and – my sister. Can you find out the time and have someone wake me?” “Of course.” I clutched the cloak in my fist and admired it once more. “I’ll wear this to the service.” Pierre frowned. “We might have a black veil you can use. I don’t think you can wear red for a funeral.” I flashed on him. “Don’t tell me what to wear.” He studied me, then shrugged: “Red it is,” he said. “Get some sleep.” I lay down, wrapped the red cloak around myself and pulled the blankets up as Pierre returned to the ladder. I sat up. “Pierre?” His head poked up through the square opening. “Thank you,” I said. He smiled and gave a nod, then descended through the hole. I blew out the candle and the room sank into darkness. 153 16. Where are you going, little girl? I saw myself walking through the woods and tensed. The same woods I traveled as a child. I was on my way to Grand’Mere Marie’s house again, carrying a basket of bread and cheese. But I was myself, sixteen years old. I knew I was having a nightmare, but I couldn’t wake up. “Where are you going, little girl?” a gruff voice repeated from the forest. 154 I peered through black trees, thick as a fortress gate. A pair of low eyes studied me. The creature came slowly between the trunks, a thick shadow of black fur and pointed ears. Eyes shone from the shadow, a pale bluish-gray. The large wolf came into view, still lingering behind a few trees. I stepped backward, my heart racing. “Don’t be afraid,” it said. “… You’re a wolf.” The shadow nodded. It seemed to grin. “Wolves don’t talk.” I clutched the basket to my chest and took another step back. As if I could disappear within the folds of my cloak. “I do,” it said. “Where are you going, little girl?” A chilling breeze tickled my cheeks. My voice was barely a breath. “To my Grand’Mere’s house.” “And where does she live?” “… just over the hill, past the three oaks.” My eyes locked on the furry shadow as my fingers locked around the basket’s handle. “I’ve never seen a wolf like you.” “No?” Its voice was sheer mockery. I shook my head. I wanted to run, to scream. But my legs stiffened in place like a terrified fawn. The wolf stood taller than me, as it had appeared when I was only seven. Its head was half the size of my body. “You have – such big eyes. And ears. And such big teeth.” His fangs spread with pleasure. “The better to see and hear you with, Mademoiselle.” 155 I heard my breath flowing in and out. In and out. “… And your teeth?” It leaned toward me. It kept leaning in as it padded closer, closer. “The better to eat you!” I clutched the basket and raised it to protect my face. To hide my eyes from its open, dripping mouth. A sharp crack sounded over the hill. It was Grand’Mere’s neighbor, Francois, splitting wood with his ax. He would hear if I screamed. The wolf regarded me casually. “We’ll meet again, Mademoiselle. Soon. But keep silent about our first meeting.” It raised its paw to its pursed lips, as if signaling me to be quiet. The way a human would. “Now run to your Grand’Mere’s. Before she starts to worry.” The wolf turned and loped away. Beyond it, the eyes of six other wolves shone in the distance. Watching and waiting. I backed away carefully as they remained in their positions like sentinels. I hurried off through the trees. As I ran, I noticed the first wolf nearby, keeping pace with me. Its enormous black figure loped gently at first. Then it bounded through the woods, leaving me far behind. It was headed to Grand’Mere’s. I gasped and ran harder. About ten minutes later, I finally reached her cottage and threw open the door. Inside, on Grand’Mere’s bed, the wolf circled about her sheets and nightgown, smeared with her blood. It turned toward me and smiled. 156 It jumped down from the bed, padding toward me. I had rushed too far into the cottage to retreat in time. I ran behind Grand’Mere’s rocking chair to shield myself. The black wolf stood on its hind legs and knocked the chair aside like a toy. It loomed over me, eyes shining, and spread its claws. I jumped back from it. Its claws still connected, cutting into the tender flesh of my forehead and cheeks. I spun and fell back. My own blood flew about my head. Then it dripped into a scarlet pool on Grand’Mere’s wooden floor where I fell. The open wound burned like fire. I screamed but I couldn’t hear myself. Couldn’t think of anything but the wolf as it dropped to all fours. The monster prowled closer, its open mouth salivating. Something kicked open the front door. Francois Revelier burst in, carrying his ax in two fists like a hammer of judgment. He rushed at the giant wolf and raised his weapon. Its silver edge caught the sunlight from the door and flashed with blinding light. He brought the heavy blade down as the beast charged, striking its shoulder and knocking it to the floor. The wound trickled blood as the wolf struggled to rise. Then it stumbled, confused, and fell. Fell to the floor and didn’t move. Francois squinted at it, looking perplexed. The wolf’s vacant eyes no longer blinked. Francois set his jaw and stomped forward. He lopped off the monster’s head with one clean stroke. The wolf lay there in its own blood, still 157 and horrible and harmless, while Francois stood over it like David over the head of the slain Goliath. In that instant, I learned that heroes existed. People who would risk their own lives to save mine. People like Francois. Something growled from outside. At each window, the head of another large wolf eyed us. The same wolves that studied me from the forest. Francois turned as they burst through the openings. They leaped on top of him and bit into his back, his shoulders, his arms. Francois dropped his ax and screamed as he sank to his knees beneath the bloodthirsty pile. Then the head of the first wolf – the one Francois has slain – turned again to smile at me. Then – impossibly – its head slid back to its body to rejoin its neck, re-forming itself. It stood on its hind legs again and grinned at me in triumph. Then it joined the others feeding on Francois as he flailed his arms and shrieked. I jerked upright in bed and whirled about in the blackness, trying to focus. I relaxed my neck and shoulders in the dark room. On the cot in the loft above the blacksmith’s shop, where Pierre let me sleep. I was alone. No beasts or monsters. Only me and my scars. I lay back down and drew the red cloak back around myself. The cloak that belonged to Pierre’s mother, before she died. I pulled the blankets up to my shoulders and lay there on the warm cot, wide-eyed and shivering. 158 17. “Red?’ Pierre’s head popped up through the hole in the loft floor. I pulled the dress up in front of my bare shoulders and gasped. He spotted me standing in nothing but my linen chemise, before I covered myself with his mother’s cream-white gown. He immediately lowered his gaze. “Uh, sorry, Red. I just – I noticed you lit the candle and you were up, so – Just wanted to let you know Father Vestille’s 159 preparing for burial. People are already heading to the church.” “All right,” I said, still clutching the dress. “My clothes were covered in blood. I hope you don’t mind me borrowing one of your mother’s gowns.” He cleared his throat. “Yeah. Sure. No problem.” I waited. “I’m just dressing now.” “Right. Yeah. Of course. I’ll just, uh – wait down in the shop.” “Yes, you will.”",

      "content": "“Yes, I will,” he repeated, and was gone. I waited to hear him descend the last step of the wooden ladder before I lowered my hands. I resumed dressing in his mother’s satin gown. It was the only suitable outfit that wasn’t tattered with age. A full-length mirror stood beside the wardrobe. The dress would work, though it seemed more suited for a ball than a funeral. I donned her red cloak and tied it about my neck. “Let me know when you’re ready, all right, Red?” Pierre called from below. I stared at my reflection. At the red cloak around my head and shoulders. The bright color I had been forbidden to wear for nine years. Ever since the wolves began to rule my life and the lives of everyone around me. Wearing this cloak gave me a surge of energy inside, a sense of strength I had never known, even when hunting. 160 “Yes, Pierre,” I called back. “I’m ready now.” “Here she is,” Pierre said, waving a hand toward Madame Leóne as he gently guided me toward her with his hand on my back. Madame Leóne bent forward in her elegant homemade gown, spun of midnight blue silk with an embroidered bodice. The exquisite sort of dress Mama might have made for me, if I were wearing it for someone else’s funeral. She clutched me to herself as we stood outside la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu. “I’m so sorry, dear,” she said, cradling me. I remained rigid, ashamed that I could not return her tender hug. All of my emotions had been burned to ashes, leaving me empty. I kept still and silent as a harsh wind began to whip at our skirts, warning of the approaching storm. She finally broke off the embrace, as cautiously as she had started it, and offered a weak smile. She struggled to clear her throat. “That’s – such a beautiful cloak, Helena. Your mother would have loved to see you in it.” Monsieur Leóne emerged, holding open the door for us. “He’s about to start, Lisette,” he said in a subdued tone. “We should – .” He gaped at me. At my bright red cloak. “… Brianna …” he muttered. Madame Leóne turned sharply to him. “Oh, dear. Is that – ?” She glanced back at me, her eyes 161 wide. “I had no idea. But – it’s so beautiful, isn’t it, Frayne?” Monsieur Leóne continued to stare at me, not moving. “No one’s really – using it, Papa,” Pierre broke in slowly. “And Helena’s old enough to wear it. I just thought – .” Monsieur Leóne held up a hand, stopping him. “It’s fine,” he said. “Yes, she – she looks lovely. So sorry it’s – being worn for such a sad occasion.” He swallowed. “You’re welcome to the cloak, Helena. I believe – perhaps it’s right for you to have it.” He turned aside, staring at the dirt. Then regained his composure. “Come along. It’s – time to get things started.” “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” I sat quiet and still in the pew beside Pierre inside the church, watching Father Vestille prepare to give the eulogy and pray over the bodies of Mama and Suzette. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The caskets were closed. Nearly thirty people had assembled to pay honor to my family’s memory. As always, Duke Laurent’s presence in the second row gave the service added a significant prestige. His advisor, Monsieur Simonet, sat beside him, his usual frown now seeming appropriate. Father Vestille hung his head, slow to begin. Finally, he lifted his eyes, grimaced, and 162 spoke in a hoarse voice. “My friends …” He cleared his throat and started again. “My friends. Thank you for coming. We are here to lay to rest – the bodies of Celeste Basque and – her youngest daughter, Suzette Basque. Both brutally attacked by beasts earlier this morning.” He paused, closing his eyes. Gathering his breath. “Our hearts cannot be heavier. My heart cannot be heavier. To lose such a wonderful woman and her innocent child. The Basque family has been like my own family. They welcomed me into this community and into their home. Their kindness, their openness and hospitality, inspired me to be more open to others. To find ways to reach out and welcome neighbors and strangers, the way they welcomed me.” Father Vestille observed the silent coffins. He looked so sad, so defeated, as if he might struggle to lift his head. His voice choked. “Celeste and Suzette Basque have become – even closer to me these last few months, since – since Henri Basque died. He was also – He was also cruelly taken by a wolf. Their eldest daughter, Helena, is still with us. And I urge all of you to do whatever you can, anything you can, to show her support and comfort in this time of great loss. It’s more than anyone, especially a young girl like Helena, should be forced to bear.” I felt the eyes of others staring at me. Even Pierre glanced at me. To see my reaction. I ignored all of them, staring back at Father Vestille in stony silence. Memorizing each hollow word. 163 He stood a little taller, finding more of his voice. “But we must encourage ourselves, not only in the face of death, but in life. In all that we face, even in the midst of the most horrible tragedy, we must seek the face of the Lord and draw strength from him to continue with every task of daily life. With every disappointment, every grief, every threat –.” I rose from my seat. Father Vestille stopped. Covering the cream dress, I still wore the red cloak, which had drawn several curious stares when we entered the church. But no one dared criticize what I had chosen to wear for the burial of my remaining family. And no one would interfere with me now as I stepped toward the caskets. I stopped in front of the smaller one and stared down at it. I turned to Father Vestille. “Open it.” His skin paled like a phantom. “Helena. I – I know how horrible this is for you, but –.” “Open it.” He stood frozen behind the pulpit, with no idea how to respond. The rest of the crowd kept silent in their seats. I walked behind the wooden coffin. Peeling my hood back, I lifted the lid. Inside, a few pieces of Suzette’s body had been carefully laid. Each one stripped clean of the majority of decaying flesh and dried blood. I marveled at how quickly Father Vestille had gathered and prepared them. Each piece had been neatly arranged, the hand and partial skull and 164 ribcage exactly where they should be. Except that the lower part of the ribcage was a pile of fractured sticks. This was not my sister. Only her bones. My sister’s soul had ascended and I would not see her again until my own death. All that remained of her was this pile of lifeless flesh, which would never smile again, never run again, never laugh again. I faced the spectators. Neighbors, cousins, and friends I had not seen for months. I couldn’t even remember some of their names. Pierre and his parents, Duke Laurent and even Simonet, stared at me in shock, almost fear. I lifted Suzette’s skeletal hand up high, to show everyone it was no longer connected to her tiny wrist. Women squealed and nestled against their husbands, while mothers shielded their children’s eyes. I no longer cared. I met their stares, glaring back at them. I held the hand higher. “This … will end.” I laid the hand gently back in its place with the rest of my sister’s useless parts. Then I slammed the coffin lid down, letting it echo through the sanctuary. I secured my hood once more and marched past the stunned crowd toward the rear oak doors. Ignoring Father Vestille as he gaped from the front. Past Duke Laurent, Papa’s old friend, who seemed ready to stand and comfort or dissuade me, but wisely held his place. Past Pierre, wrinkling his brow with worry, as his parents looked on with stunned faces. 165 I pushed the double doors open and strode to Crimson, who snorted eagerly beside Pierre’s horse. I climbed onto his back and he lifted his hooves, as if sensing my urgency. We galloped off into the darkening afternoon as a storm threatened on the horizon. 166 18. I rode back to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and found the spare key beneath the stone near the front stoop, where I knew Monsieur Leóne kept it. I unlocked the shop’s front door and went inside, wondering if I might ruin the late Madame Leóne’s satin gown just by walking through the warm oily air. I didn’t climb up to the loft to rest or gather my thoughts. Instead, I lit a few candles and started rummaging through the shop. I had decided on my 167 next course of action. I just needed to work out the details. I was still gathering bolts and knives when I heard fast hooves approaching. I continued working as I recognized Diamond’s whinny from out front before Pierre burst through the door. “Red! Red, what are you doing?” “Preparing for a hunt.” I continued to pace the tables and shelves, selecting weapons. “I need your help, Pierre. I need a pair of boots.” “Boots?” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “What for? If you need slippers or sandals –.” “No. I’m going hunting and I need boots to get through the mud.” He remained confused. “I know you can hunt, but … boots? I mean –.” He shook his head, as if unable to speak. “What?” “Well – You’re a girl.” We stared at one another in silence. “I am aware of that. I need the boots, nevertheless.” “We don’t even sell boots.” “I know.” I bit my lip. “I was hoping you might have an extra pair I can borrow.” “Yeah. I guess. I have some old boots I meant to pass on to someone. They might fit you, if you really need them.” “Thank you.” He remained confused. “Still seems awfully odd for a girl.” I took another deep breath. “I also need a pair of trousers.” 168 He stared blankly at me. “I realize I’m still a girl,” I said. He studied the cold stone floor. “You’re going after those wolves, aren’t you?” I said nothing. The wind outside gave a shrill whistle. “Red, those things could kill you. We can get some men together and –.” “No, we can’t. Because none of them will go.” Pierre swallowed. “Then I’ll go with you.” “No, you won’t.” “Why not?” “Because.” I struggled for an answer. I would welcome anyone’s help to hunt those beasts. Anyone but Pierre. “Because if anything happens to me, I need you to tell the others what I’ve done. Apart from that, I’m binding you to secrecy.” “What? But, Red –!” “Promise me. Promise you won’t tell anyone. If they know, they’ll try to stop me, the same way you are. If they stop me, no one else will hunt them. Then more people will be killed and it will never stop. Promise me.” All the color drained from his face, leaving him a helpless phantom. “… all right. I promise.” “Thank you, Pierre.” He looked about the shop. “If you won’t change your mind, at least let me supply you with some good weapons.” “I’ve already started.” He studied my pile of knives and ammunition. “That’s a good start, but you’ll need 169 more. If you’re right, these are no ordinary wolves. You’ll need extraordinary weapons. Too bad you can’t have your own set of claws, to even it up.” I lifted my father’s crossbow. “This should help, at least.” “Yeah,” Pierre said, studying the crossbow with a curious look. He continued to eye it carefully as he spoke. “I’ve actually been working on something for you. I meant to surprise you with it, but – guess I’d better give it to you now. I also designed some tools people could use to guard their homes, with all these attacks.” He shook his head. “Never thought I’d be giving them all to you, but – Let me find those boots, and, uh – a pair of extra trousers.” “Where are you getting those?” “… from my wardrobe.” I swallowed, sharing his discomfort. “… thank you.” He nodded and stepped away. “Let me get you some gloves, too. Should come in handy out there. I’ll be right back.” He dimmed the candles, lit a lantern and headed toward his room at the rear of the shop. For a moment, I felt warmer inside, knowing Pierre would give me all the protection he could. In the upper room a few minutes later, I untied my red hood and let it fall to the bed, then removed my cream dress. I donned Pierre’s ivory tunic and deerskin trousers, feeling perverse. I had 170 not worn pants since I was seven, when I had to borrow clothes from Doctor Renoire’s son. I wondered what my parents would think if they could see me tonight. Mama would grieve and abandon all hope that I would ever become a sophisticated woman. Papa might share her concern, but feel a sense of pride that I was doing what I had to do. What someone had to do. As I thought of them, I stifled a half-choking sob. But I had vowed to stop crying. It felt strange, preparing to go out in public with folds of cloth surrounding my legs. At the same time, I felt freedom to move, back and forth, twisting and turning, with no skirt getting in the way. I tied the cloak about my neck and stood, moving my toes about in the boots, getting used to the feel of them. I stepped back a few quick paces, then forth again, then spun about. My cloak twirled after me, threatening to catch against me the way my skirt used to. But there was little comparison. I had to be careful how I moved, to avoid wrapping my shoulders tightly into the cloak, but I wouldn’t fall over myself or tangle my legs together the way I might in a dress. And I needed the cloak to feel less exposed. I smiled. In this outfit, I could run and leap without holding back. I could climb or descend a hill fast, and quickly position myself to launch a bolt in any direction. Most important, I could fight. I could dodge or strike someone without fear of stumbling or appearing unladylike. I caught my reflection in the mirror and my heart sank. 171 I looked like a man. Not even a handsome man, but a pretentious dandy with blonde locks. Scarred and disfigured by some accident, now trying to compensate for it by dressing in a flowing silk shirt, cuffed leather boots and an oversized red cloak. I looked horrendous. I took a deep breath and released it. What did it matter how I looked? I had lived with my ugly scars for nine years. What did it matter if I looked even worse? I kept staring at myself – at the strange person in the mirror – and wondered what would become of me, if I even survived this night. Would anyone mourn the strange scarred girl from the sheep farm outside the village? But if I didn’t go, who would even be left to mourn? Those beasts would return, again and again. Picking us off one by one until they had eaten their fill. They had to be stopped. They had to be killed. I donned the hood. It shaded my eyes and made me look fearsome. Otherwise, I felt naked with my legs uncovered. But there was nothing I could do about it. I left the dress in the wardrobe, my legs exposed for all the world to see. I prepared to venture into the forest, looking like an animal. I descended the ladder. I heard Pierre scraping metal against metal, sharpening something, as I clomped onto the wood floor and stepped past the furnace to face him. He gasped. “Helena. You look –.” “Even less attractive, I know.” “Uh, no. Just, uh – just different.” 172 “How I look doesn’t matter. What matters is how well I can move, and I can move more freely in this.” “Uh – All right.” He continued to stare at me. At my legs in particular. “Are you sure you want to – go out like that?” “Are you sure you can’t stop staring?” I was glad the long cloak covered me from the rear or he might have had fits. “Sorry. It’s just odd to see you – I mean – for you to wear trousers.” I drew the cloak around myself a little, knowing how bizarre I looked. “Why should it matter? You’ve seen other men in trousers.” “Well, that’s a little different. I mean – they’re men.” He finally shook his head, like a dog shaking himself dry, and tore his eyes away from my legs. He returned his attention to the table, where he had arranged a couple of slim daggers he had sharpened, several bolts, and a rope and hook beside a pair of leather gloves. “I’ve been working on some things here to give you some extra help.” He demonstrated the various tools, including an impressive grappling hook for scaling a wall or a cliff face. Its prongs flicked out when he slid a metal catch open with his thumb. With each new device, I found myself more enchanted by his cleverness. Finally, he held up a crossbow, crowned with something that resembled a long snuff box. “What’s that?” 173 “Chinese repeating crossbow,” he said with pride. “I read about it and figured out how to build one. You load the top slot here –.” He dropped in ten bolts, one at a time. “Then you just keep pulling back on this top lever. Every time you pull back, it fires another bolt.” I almost yanked it from him. Then stared at the priceless treasure in my hands. “Pierre. This is – incredible. Thank you.” He shrugged. “Anything I can do to help. I figure, this way, you can fire again if you miss the first time.” I raised an eyebrow at him. “I won’t miss.” “All right, but – if you need to shoot again, you can fire right away.” I studied the crossbow up and down. It was pure genius. “This is perfect, Pierre. Two shots to make sure I kill it. With enough bolts to shoot down four more before I reload.” “Four – four more?” I squinted at him, wondering why he seemed surprised. “Wolves hunt in packs, Pierre. You know that. There were at least four that attacked Francois.” “Yeah, but I didn’t think – I mean, you can’t hunt them all down at once.” “I can try.” I tugged Pierre’s thick leather gloves on, then gathered my father’s crossbow and a handful of bolts. I slung the strap of Pierre’s repeating crossbow over my shoulder and grabbed tucked a few knives into a sheath, placing them in a leather pouch with the bolts, to hang from Crimson’s saddle. 174 I strode into the brisk evening with Pierre fast on my heels. Crimson turned sharply at the opening door, eager to be off. “Red, you’ll be careful, right? Promise you’ll watch yourself.” “I’ll watch myself.” I hooked the repeating crossbow onto the saddle, along with Papa’s crossbow and the ammunition pouch, then hoisted myself up. “With that red hood, they’ll see you coming a mile away.” I knew he was right. But I refused to live another day in fear. And this hooded cloak was the only thing bolstering my confidence to survive the night. “I want them to see me coming,” I said. He narrowed his eyes. “… What?” My blood surged. Crimson stamped his hooves, perhaps feeling the same fire. “I want to make them afraid, the way they made us afraid. Whatever those things are, I want them to know one of us is fighting back.” Pierre gaped, as if uncertain what to think. “Red, what are you going to do?” I set my jaw like stone. “Something.” I spurred Crimson forth. He snorted and charged ahead. Lightning stabbed at the horizon as Pierre called after me. I saw Father Vestille on his Palomino, trotting toward L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. We met with surprised eyes and I fumbled with the reins, nearly making Crimson stumble before he galloped past. Father Vestille tugged his horse to a halt and struggled to turn about. 175 “Helena! Helena, come back!” he called. I can only imagine how he would react to the bare trousers beneath my flapping cloak. I might be cast out of the church. It no longer mattered. I still had faith, but I had lost all patience. If he put me out of the church for trying to save our province, so be it. The cries of Pierre and Father Vestille echoed behind me, farther and farther away as I galloped through the darkening streets. 176 177 178 MY DISCOVERY 179 180 19. Rain started to drizzle as I arrived at La Maison de Touraine, but it didn’t dampen the wild revelry within its walls. I could see why Mama often referred to taverns as “dens”. The crowd inside rumbled like a pack of growling beasts. I had never set foot in this place except for the banquet to honor Francois, the night he died. But La Maison was a center for local gossip. The perfect starting place to learn what anyone knew about the wolves. Someone must have heard rumors or witnessed recent attacks. 181 An alcoholic stench filled the misty air. I wished for a safer way to seek information. My parents would have preferred that I forget this place altogether. But Francois had told me to seek out his friend if I ever needed help. As we trotted toward the hitching post, two men on the front porch stopped their conversation and stared. At the red horse and its red-cloaked rider. The short man’s mouth hung open. I wondered how much I resembled the Apocalyptic horseman that brought a plague of war. Though I doubted this squat man or his liquor bottle spent much time listening to the Scriptures. “Evening, Monsieur,” he greeted. I said nothing as I swung off Crimson’s flank to plant both boots together on the ground. I had no business with this man and his tone seemed more demanding than friendly. “I said, ‘Evening,’” Squat repeated. He and his slim mustached companion stepped between me and the entrance. “Evening,” I muttered. The mustached man squinted at me. He grabbed at my shoulder and spun me to face him. I looked up in his astonished face. “Why, she’s a girl!” he sputtered. “What sort of game do you think you’re playing, Mademoiselle?” Squat demanded. “This ain’t no place for someone like you.” I swallowed down fear and anger. I had no time for this. “I’ll see for myself and let you know,” I said. 182 I started forward. Moustache moved to block me. Behind me, Crimson grumbled and shifted uneasily, while Squat took another swig of his bottle. “You should listen to your betters, Mademoiselle,” Moustache said. “If you want some drinks, I’ll show you where to find some. More private, away from all these gawkers.” Crimson snorted, ready to charge him. “Step aside, Monsieurs,” I warned. Squat chuckled and glanced at Moustache, who laughed along. “Now, now, Mademoiselle. You didn’t say, ‘please’.” I pulled my crossbow from beneath my cloak and aimed its bolt-end directly beneath Squat’s jowls. They stopped laughing abruptly as my other hand settled on the lever. “Please.” Squat nodded, slow and careful, backing away to let me pass. I lowered the crossbow, measuring their reactions. Satisfied that they would not bother me further, I concealed it beneath my cloak once more. “Would you look after my horse while I’m inside? He sometimes gets agitated around strangers.” Squat and Moustache turned to Crimson, who glared back with eyes that seemed to spit flame. “Yeah,” Moustache said dully. “Sure.” “Why, thank you,” I said. Moustache took a step toward me and Crimson stamped his hoof. Both men spread their arms as they backed up to the wall. Crimson would have no trouble with them. 183 I moved to the oak doors and pushed inside. Into a room of noise and smoke and wild laughter. Where men dressed formally but acted foolishly, and a handful of women moved from table to table, dressed even less modestly than I was, serving drinks and letting men gawk at them from every angle. At the bar counter, separated from the chaos surrounding him, stood a plump man with thinning auburn hair. He talked with two men there as he busied himself polishing a wooden mug. The man I had come to see. The tavern owner, Gerard Touraine. I strode toward the counter, noting the quiet that came in my wake. Like the ripples of a swan wading through a polluted stream. Everyone seemed dumbstruck at the sight of me. Including the men at the counter who watched me approach. For a moment, none of them spoke. “That’s quite a cloak, Monsieur,” said Touraine, wiping the mug in his hand. He turned to put it away and grab a new one from the pegs on the wall. I didn’t know if he had meant that as a compliment. I assumed not. “Thank you.” Touraine stopped and turned on his heel. He took a step toward me and crouched to peer at my mouth beneath the hood. “Eh – are you lost, Mademoiselle?” he asked with a chuckle. Then his face fell. “Wait. You’re that little girl, from Francois’ party. With the, eh –.” His hand rose to make a gesture at his face. He stopped himself before making reference to my 184 scars. I appreciated that. “Francois saved my life,” I said. “He was a good friend of mine.” “Yes,” Touraine said. He cleared his throat. “Mine, too.” One of the other men laughed. “What’s this, Gerard? Your niece paying you a visit? Or is it someone else, eh?” He nudged his friend on the next wooden stool and both men chuckled. Touraine ignored them, focusing on me. “Uh – I’m afraid women aren’t allowed in here, Mademoiselle.” I glanced at the tall brunette leaning over a table of men with her hands on her hips. “She is a woman.” “Of course, but she’s – eh –.” “She has a point, Gerard,” the other man insisted. “That is definitely a woman over there. So it stands to reason, if this mademoiselle insists upon –.” “Enough,” Touraine said, silencing him. “She’s made a mistake. She came to the wrong place, nothing more.” I climbed up onto the stool across from him. I had never sat in such a high chair. But then, I started wearing trousers before today, either. “All I want is a drink.” Touraine shook his head, his brown eyes apologizing. “I couldn’t serve you.” “Oh, come now, Gerard.” The man fished out some coins to toss on the counter. “Here, Mademoiselle. I’ll buy you one.” 185 “Move on,” Touraine ordered the men. “I’ll handle this. Find yourselves a table. We’ll talk later.” The second man held up his hands. “We’re only teasing her, Gerard. Don’t get excited.” Touraine leaned toward them suddenly, almost menacing. “Find a table,” he repeated. The men climbed awkwardly down from their stools and walked away, staring over their shoulders at Touraine as he watched them go. “I only want water,” I said. “Can you serve me that?” Touraine paused to consider, then turned to grab a fresh mug. “I am also curious,” I said as he filled it. “You’re curious?” he asked, amused. “You enter a tavern with that huge cloak and you’re curious. Very well. What are you curious about, Mademoiselle?” “Wolves.” His wrist twitched, then continued to fill the mug. He set it on the counter before me, his head down. He looked up. “Wolves in general?” “Wolves in particular. A large wolf that killed a little girl near here.” “Heard about that. Tragic.” “She was my sister.” Touraine buried his heavy gaze in the floor. “… Very sorry, Mademoiselle.” “I’m curious about that wolf. A lot of people pass through here. Have you heard anything about it?” 186 He narrowed his eyes, looking confused. “Why should I tell you if I did?” “Tell me tonight and you’ll know why tomorrow.” He stepped around the counter. “I think someone should see you home, Mademoiselle.” “I have no home,” I said. The sudden rise in my voice stopped him cold. “The wolves took it from me.” “Well, what about your parents?” My shoulders trembled as I thought of Mama and Papa and Suzette. I stiffened to hide it. “… The wolves took everything.” He swallowed. “I’m so sorry, Mademoiselle. I am. But I don’t see how I can help you.” “You can’t tell me what you know about the wolves that killed my mother and father and little sister? That keep killing off more and more people in the village? I only want to know what they are, what they might be doing.” “Look. I understand you’re hurting. But whatever killed your parents and your sister is dangerous. Probably more dangerous than you can imagine. It’s no business of mine and certainly no business of yours. And I don’t think you want me to hear of another young girl’s death tomorrow. Do you?” “But you have heard things. Haven’t you?” He started to say something. Then chewed on his lip. “I think they’re the same wolves that killed Francois,” I prodded. 187 “Francois was a good man,” he said, his lip protruding in a sideways pout. “A very good man.” “He was too late to save my Grand’Mere from the wolf, but he saved me. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. He was my hero. He still is. He’s the one who sent me to you.” Touraine shot a look at me and narrowed his eyes. “How’s that?” “He said if I ever needed to know anything about anything in the village or beyond, you would be the one to ask.” That was not quite true. Francois had told me to seek Touraine out if I got in real trouble. But this qualified. I needed help and Touraine was the one who could give it. I pressed on. “He also said people need to stand up and do something to help others. Or there would be more killings. More children suffering. He said we can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s right, because some things are worth fighting for.” Touraine lifted his chin. “Francois said that?” I stiffened my jaw. “Yes.” He stared hard at me. Then relaxed. “Yeah, that sounds like something Francois would say. Good man.” “But he’s gone now,” I said, leaning forward on the stool. “He’s dead. A pack of wolves broke into his home and killed him.” Touraine nodded. “I know.” “You also know something about those wolves. I’m a good hunter. If you tell me, I can 188 stop some of them, at least. If you don’t, they’ll keep killing.” He still hesitated, but seemed intrigued. Almost believing me. “Please.” He studied me another moment. Then he resumed his position behind the counter and leaned over it. “If I don’t tell you, I expect you’ll find out from someone else. Won’t you?” I nodded. “All right, Mademoiselle. Don’t ask anyone but me. Understand? You want to know anything, or if something is true, you come straight to me, no one else.” “I will,” I promised. I meant it. This was exactly what I wanted. Touraine glanced from one side of the bar to the other. Then he began to polish a new mug as he spoke in a low murmur. “I don’t know much, Mademoiselle. Some men come in here regularly, and they seem to know something about those wolves. Always eager for news about them, just like you. Always asking for details about recent attacks. It’s odd. They seem delighted by it, like someone’s telling a joke. Lately they’ve been asking about Monsieur Favreau’s farm.” “Monsieur Favreau?” “Pig farmer on the other side of the hill, west end of the forest. Lost four of his fattest pigs to a wolf over the last two weeks. He’s worried he’ll lose the rest, though he’s got plenty to spare, if you ask me.” “When did he lose them?” 189 Touraine rubbed his stubbly chin. “One was two nights ago, the other two nights before that.” He narrowed his eyes and blinked with sudden realization. “Seems it’s been every two nights since it took the first one. Following a pattern.” “Which continues tonight,” I said, finishing the thought that was surely brewing in his mind. I rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle, your drink.” I retrieved the mug. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” I downed the water in one long swallow and returned the mug before heading to the door. “Mademoiselle?” I turned at the door. He looked helpless as a child. “I trust – you have someone to look after you?” “Yes,” I said, stepping out into the storm. “I am.” I let the door thud behind me. 190 20. Favreau’s farm was easy enough to find. I just followed the smell. Even in the rain, the distinctive odor of pig manure spread for a mile. Smoke rose from a thin chimney above the farmer’s spacious cabin, set in a broad clearing surrounded by dense forest. A long narrow pigpen sat beside it, the large pigs kicking up mud and manure as the silvery moon rose above the trees. To the left of the pen sat a small and well-kept stable, large enough to keep two or more horses. 191 Monsieur Favreau would have his eyes and ears pricked for any intruders. He must have noticed the same pattern of attack by now, how the wolf seized one of his pigs every other night. Tonight he could expect to lose another one. I climbed down from the saddle and led Crimson carefully around the perimeter. He moved so cautiously, I don’t think he broke a single twig. Hidden from the cabin windows by the horse stable, I crept toward it, leading Crimson. As we came around the corner, Monsieur Favreau’s black horse started in alarm, stamping and neighing. I quickly found the feedbag, hanging from a hook on the wall, and grabbed a handful of oats. I opened my hand for the horse to see and sniff. He calmed immediately and let me approach so he could nibble from my hand. I shared some with his companion, who had just woken, then grabbed more oats to feed them again. Once they relaxed, I brought Crimson into the stable to stand between their twin stalls. I scanned the clearing. Nothing moved in the dark woods around the farm, though the drizzle made it difficult to be certain. I hoped that any wolves would have equal trouble spotting me. Dim light issued from within the house. Monsieur Favreau must have lit a lantern to keep a late vigil over his property. I grabbed more oats and prepared to lay the pile in my skirt. Then I remembered I was no longer wearing one. I stuffed them in my pants pockets instead, wishing I could store more. I 192 reminded myself that the trousers still gave me the best advantage. I crouched and crept toward the pen. A few pigs squealed upon seeing me approach in my sweeping cloak. I scattered a few oats at them, and they returned to their agitated pacing. Farmer Favreau wasn’t the only one anxious about the wolves tonight. I crawled carefully between the wooden bars of their pen. The pigs backed away and huddled against one another, but they no longer cried out. They gradually spread apart to move freely about the pen once more, though they kept an eye on me, snorting little warnings as they passed by. I crouched in the filthy mud and slop and waited, forcing my senses to adapt to the intolerable smell. At least the rain would wash away some of the manure from my clothes, once I left the pen. But that would be a long time in coming. I would keep vigil until the wolf arrived. I felt the crossbow at my hip. Not my father’s, but Pierre’s Chinese repeating crossbow. As brave as I made myself appear to everyone else, I couldn’t afford to miss or waste time reloading. I sat for over twenty minutes. By then, the pigs seemed to regard me as part of their pen – a piece of scenery to walk around as they continued their nervous pacing. Nearly half of them had fallen asleep. The others seemed as tense as I was. I finally sat in the slop. My knees and thighs were tired, and I no longer cared how I looked or smelled, or what I had to scrub off the 193 cloak later. In any case, this almost guaranteed that the Leóne family would not ask for it back. I leaned against the gate post, turning my head now and then to check for anything approaching from behind the farmhouse. It felt good to finally rest. Nervous as I was, my shoulders and head felt heavy. I closed my eyes and thought of Suzette. Sweet, pure Suzette. Playing among the white daffodils in our meadow, running from me and laughing, her golden hair streaming in the biting wind. I saw her run toward the dark forest. Beyond the first line of trees, the woods were black as coal. Except for the eyes. More than a dozen pairs of eyes, shining from the darkness. “Suzette, stop!” Papa called from behind me. “Come back!” “Suzette, no! Suzette!” Mama screamed. Suzette continued to laugh and run in an irregular pattern, playing a game of escaping me, escaping us all, while the eyes watched from the forest. “Suzette, turn around!” It was Francois Revelier shouting, beckoning her back. Suzette wouldn’t listen. “Helena, go after her!” Papa told me. “Bring her back!” I stood where I was. I watched Suzette, laughing and playing as she drew closer to the forest. “Go, Helena!” Mama urged. “You can get her! Bring her back!” 194 “But the wolves …” I muttered. I felt a tremor through my skin, like a spider crawling up my spine. “You can bring her back, Helena,” Francois said. “You’re the only one who can do it.” Suzette giggled and dodged back and forth, closer and closer to the forest. To the waiting eyes that had grown in number, nearly twenty of them now. “But they’ll kill me, too …” “Helena,” Mama said in a quiet voice. “Helena, please …” “You can do it, Helena,” Papa said. “Bring her back. Bring her back.” A tear flowed down my cheek. “I can’t …” Suzette’s laughter echoed from the forest’s edge. “Can’t catch me!” Then she turned and ran straight into the dark abyss, where teeth flashed open beneath each pair of eyes. “Papa?” I started suddenly. Soft rain fell on my cheeks and I rankled at the damp odor of pig manure. The tiny voice came from the front porch. A little freckled girl stood there in her nightgown, staring out into the dark clearing. I looked and saw a heavyset man standing between puddles, holding a musket. Farmer Favreau, no doubt, watching for the wolves. I had dozed off. Never even noticed him leaving the house. As he surveyed the outer perimeter of trees, I craned my neck, letting the rain needle down on me. Moonlight shone between 195 rolling clouds, directly overhead. I had slept nearly an hour. I looked back at Favreau as his gun whirled in my direction. Its barrel aimed squarely at my hooded forehead. I sat frozen in the mud and darkness. The bearded Favreau stood rigid, squinting through rain at the pigpen. Watching for any movement, listening for any strange sounds. I made none. He finally relented and turned slowly back to the trees, while rain pelted the surrounding leaves. I felt my heart start beating again. “Lucille, go back to bed,” he called over his shoulder, still watching the forest. “I’m not sleepy, Papa,” the girl complained, rubbing her eyes. I estimated her to be four years old. A year younger than Suzette, but just as lively, just as playful. Just as innocent. “Get back inside,” I muttered in a violent whisper. “Into bed,” he repeated. “Your mother wouldn’t have wanted you out in this cold, God rest her soul. Now go on.” I swallowed. He was a widower, raising little Lucille on his own. Just the two of them. “Papa, what’re you doing? Did you hear the wolf?” I felt my breath through my teeth. I alternated between my study of the trees and of the light from Favreau’s house, shining on little Lucille’s white gown. “Get back inside,” I murmured again. 196 “I heard something,” Favreau said over his shoulder. “Might be that wolf, so go on inside, like I told you.” “Yes, Papa,” she said. The rising irritation in his voice finally convinced her. My shoulders relaxed. “Look, Papa! There it is!” Blood flooded my temples as I sat higher. Lucille was right. Striding forth from the forest was a gray wolf – taller and larger than a normal wolf. It grinned, showing no fear of the musket. Perhaps it had never seen one. Or simply didn’t fear it. The rain fell harder as I raised Pierre’s crossbow. If the wolf didn’t fear a bullet, it certainly wouldn’t fear a bolt. Until I sank enough of them into its belly. At least, that’s what I hoped. It padded through the muddy field toward Favreau. As if daring him to shoot. “Get inside, Lucille,” Favreau ordered. “Kill it, Papa. Kill it before it takes another pig!” “Inside, I said!” Favreau couldn’t escort his daughter to safety and face down the wolf at the same time. He leaned his head to one side and sighted the animal patiently. Letting it draw closer into range, he waited for the right shot and pulled the trigger. A beautiful shot, right to its face. It sent the beast spinning backward to the slippery ground, dead. 197 Favreau lifted his head as Lucille jumped up and down on the porch, her fists raised in victory. “You did it, Papa, you did it!” The clearing fell quiet. The creature was dead. It was over. I was never even needed. I felt relieved and strangely cheated. But I couldn’t help but feel grateful over the huge wolf carcass lying still on the soaked grass. Then four more wolves padded into the clearing. They emerged at once, from four different positions, like an organized battalion. Grinning, they marched at Monsieur Favreau like soldiers, each as large as the first one. 198 21. Favreau stood gaping at the gathering wolves, his fingers loosening and tightening on his gun. The wolves moved closer, ignoring their fallen companion as the mounting rain pelted his carcass. “Papa, there’s more of them!” “… get back inside,” he said quietly. He started to back away slowly. The wolves picked up their pace. 199 Favreau continued to back up. He lifted his musket to a firing position, but abandoned the effort as the wolves kept coming, kept grinning. They weren’t rushing at the pigs, or even at Favreau. They focused their attention beyond him, at the porch. At Lucille. My head pounded with terror. They had planned this, waited for this opportunity. They stole a pig every couple of nights to draw the family out into the open, until they found an opportunity to attack Favreau’s daughter. Then they all emerged at once, the same way they must have attacked Francois at his home. Favreau would never get Lucille inside before the beasts devoured them both. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and sliced into the side of a pig. It squealed and ran to the other side of the pen. The wolves jerked toward the commotion as the pigs began to rush back and forth, thumping and sliding against one another. I cut into another one, encouraging their panic. Two wolves sniffed the air, perhaps smelling the flow of animal blood. I rose, my cloak billowing up from my shoulders as I brandished the crossbow. The wolves gaped along with Favreau and his daughter as I rushed between the pigs to the gate. I kicked up at the top bar to flip it open, flinging rainwater. The pigs spilled out of the pen, slipping and stumbling as they darted back and forth across the clearing. 200 The wolves continued to stare as I marched out of the pen and fired at the nearest brown beast, piercing its chest. It fell to the ground hard. The others snarled and charged, struggling for traction. “Get inside,” I ordered Favreau. “Who are you?” “Get inside!” I stepped sideways, angling to face the next wolf as it approached. The others closed in, eyeing me warily. I pulled back twice on the crossbow’s lever, firing one bolt into the first animal’s gut, the other into its paw. My racing pulse had thrown off my aim, but I had wounded it. Enough that it stayed down. I moved in a curving path between the pigs as they skidded across the muddy grass. The remaining wolves circled around me, craning to peer over the herd for a path to get at me. Between the wild flurry of pigs and the misty haze, I couldn’t tell whether there were two or three wolves closing in. They ignored Favreau and his daughter as he scuttled her into the house and shut the door. That was all that mattered. The wolves bared their teeth, dripping with saliva. I registered three of them surrounding me, a gray one to my left, brown to my right, and black behind me. The rain had played tricks on my eyes. What seemed like a perfect hit on the second wolf must have only grazed him. Two of them charged, one from each side. The gray one leaped at me as I whirled to launch a bolt into its stomach. It spun and rolled aside, howling, while I dropped backward to the ground, 201 planting my elbows in the mud. I kicked at a pig as it scurried in front of me, thrusting it at the attacking brown wolf. The startled pig knocked it several feet away, stopping it for a second. Long enough for me to roll to one side and fire a bolt into his companion behind me. Then to fire two more into the brown wolf as it bore down on me, dropping it to the puddle-soaked field. I scrambled to my feet. Three bolts left. The gray wolf rose to its feet, staggering a moment before it turned to lunge. I fired once, keeping my final bolts in reserve. It spun to the ground as the black wolf struggled to all fours and sprang at me. Another bolt finished it as the gray wolf reared back to lunge again. I tugged on the lever, sinking my last bolt into its heart. It fell in a heap and lay still. I stood in the quiet. Chest heaving in the drizzling rain. Waiting for my pulse and heartbeat to slow while the remaining pigs squealed and ran in circles through the clearing. My hands shook. I took deep breaths, ordering my arms and shoulders to relax. I reached into my pouch for another round of bolts and started loading them into the top slot, one by one, in case there were more of them. … More of them … I turned back to the clearing, where the first gray wolf had fallen. The grass there was matted down a little, where the animal had lain. But the wolf was now gone. The rain wasn’t playing tricks on my eyes. Four wolves had come from the forest, but after I 202 struck down the first one, four wolves remained. Only one of the wolves was gray. The first wolf, the one Favreau shot with his musket. It had risen to join the others and attack me again. The wolf nearest to me – the one I shot four times – groaned and rolled to its side. Then it rose and shook its head to recover. I watched, crossbow ready, as it studied its wounded paw, from which a bolt still protruded. Two similar bolts remained embedded in its stomach. It lifted the paw to its teeth, bit hard on the bolt, and tugged, nearly dislodging it. Then the creature set its paw down and reached for the bolt with its other paw. I gaped as it wrapped its claws around the bolt to seize a firm hold – the way a human would – and pulled it out. It dropped the bloody bolt to the ground and regarded me, while I blinked at the impossible feat. Crimson whinnied from his hiding place in the stable. He burst into the clearing, pounding toward me at full gallop. I grabbed onto his saddle as the wolf’s jaws opened to chomp at my legs. Crimson whisked me away and raced into the woods, as I clung to him with one foot in the stirrup. Behind me, three other wolves rose in similar fashion, grinning and showing little signs of the battle. Crimson knew when to run. 203 22. Crimson thundered through the misting rain over twigs and pine needles, as I hung precariously alongside. Pressing hard into the stirrup, I grabbed the saddle’s horn and tugged myself onto his back to settle onto him. I crouched low against his neck as he galloped through the black woods, leaving Favreau’s drenched farm behind. My fingers ached from their grip around the repeating crossbow but I refused to let go of it, despite how little it had helped me. What were these creatures that looked 204 like wolves, but withstood bullets and pulled metal bolts from their paws? Clinging to Crimson, I glanced back at the monsters chasing us. Up ahead, more pairs of red and yellow eyes leered from the darkness. I tugged at the reins and Crimson skidded to a halt, twisting to one side. Three wolves strolled out from behind tree trunks, cutting off our exit while the others closed in from behind. I tugged Crimson to the right. Two more pairs of eyes blazed in the distance. The wolves that owned them padded into the spreading moonlight. I continued circling. Another wolf loped toward us from the opposite direction. We were dead. I swallowed and drew Pierre’s crossbow. If I sank enough bolts into one of them – just one of them – it might bring him down. It was the best I could do. I was about to die, like my family. Like Francois. I would never know love. Never have children. Never see Pierre or Father Vestille or Monsieur Laurent or anyone else again. And no one in the village would know that I had died in a foolish attempt to save them. But I could still honor Suzette, if I could kill one of these monsters. Just one. The wolves blocking our escape stood ready to attack, yet they restrained themselves. I turned about to face the wolves that had chased us from the farm. Their gray leader strode toward me, his three companions following close behind. I choked back a sob. Why did I have to die? A young girl, scarred and helpless and stupid 205 enough to fight these creatures because I knew that someone needed to. Why should I die while these beasts lived to kill again? I had six bolts. It was all that could load before the wolves rose to chase me. I fired the first one. It sank into the gray wolf’s chest, throwing him backward in a tumble. The others waited as it lay on the ground. Then it rolled back to its feet, the bolt protruding from its shoulder. One of his companions padded over to him and yanked the bolt out with its teeth. Then they marched forward. I fired another. I struck him in the same place, close to his shoulder wound, hoping to weaken it. Surely their blood couldn’t flow fast enough to heal the same damaged spot. The wolf rolled backward, grunting against the pain of the blow. Then it rose to its feet again, letting another wolf tear the bolt out. They continued to advance on me as an organized mob. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I fired a third bolt. It gleamed in the moonlight as it flew, striking the wolf in the center of his skull. The animal tipped backward and its eyes rolled in a look of surprise. It spun onto its back and lay on the ground. It did not move. The forest fell quiet. The other wolves gaped at it. Not with anger or fear, but a look of actual shock. They turned toward me and I shuddered. I raised the crossbow with its pitiful three bolts 206 remaining. As I wondered how it would feel to be torn apart and eaten. Instead of attacking, the pack stared at me with wide eyes, as if frightened. Or awestruck. They backed away. I turned Crimson to face the two wolves behind me, expecting them to pounce. But at my sudden turn, they skittered backward. So did the wolves on either side. I turned Crimson again to face them, measuring their reactions. They turned and ran off in all directions, howling and scrambling as if I had set them on fire. The leader’s carcass remained still on the damp ground. Rain dripped like a drum from the tree leaves, as I felt the wild pounding of my heart. Crimson shuffled his hooves in the mud, looking from one side of the dark forest to the other as though he shared my relief and confusion. One bolt – one single bolt – had killed this beast, when every other one failed. What sort of monsters were these? I waited for a few seconds. Resting in the quiet and calm and the cooling breeze from the dissipating rain. I dismounted and touched down carefully on the ground, as though I expected it to swallow me up. But nothing happened. No wolves returned. The gray wolf leader didn’t rise to attack. Its mouth hung open with no breath, no movement. The beast was dead as a fallen log. As any wolf should be after being shot seven times. But why didn’t the first six bolts kill it? Why only the seventh? And why only this wolf? 207 I recalled the wolves from the clearing. This first one entered and was shot by Monsieur Favreau. Four more joined it, and this gray wolf rose up to attack alongside them. But only four of them followed us from the farm. I grabbed hold of the bolt lodged in the wolf’s forehead and pulled. I pressed my boot heel over its open eye and tugged, but it wouldn’t budge. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and cut into the forehead around the bolt, sawing until I made a wide bloody hole. The quieting rain turned the fresh blood even fouler. I swallowed back the bile rising in my throat and spat on the ground. I seized the bolt with both fists, pressed my boot against the animal’s face and yanked hard. The bolt came free all at once. I fell onto my rump holding the shaft, its end covered with blood and bits of bone and flesh. I shut my eyes and quieted my soul a moment. Then I stared at the mess of flesh and fur matted with blood. Underneath it, the bolt looked the same as every other one. What made it so powerful? I stood and shoved it into the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle. He flinched slightly. His stomach seemed stronger than mine, but not much stronger. I mounted and returned to the Favreau farm. I drove Crimson hard, but he needed little encouragement. He seemed just as eager to escape the forest and find shelter before the wolves returned. Favreau’s farm was the last place I wanted to be, but we had to go back. 208 It took little over a minute to reach the clearing. A dim lantern still burned within the house. Favreau might be watching us from inside or rocking his daughter back to sleep, or both. Near the house, a single brown wolf lay still, unmoving. Dead. We trotted up to it and I swung down from the saddle, landing on both feet. I ran to the carcass and rolled it onto its back. Two bolts stuck out from its belly. But blood surrounded only one bolt, in the animal’s stomach. The other bolt yielded no blood, even though it had struck the wolf’s heart. I pressed my boot against its pelt and tugged the bolt free. It pulled far more easily than the one from the gray wolf’s skull. I stared at the bloodstained bolt in the moonlight, turning it back and forth in my fist. I shot and killed this wolf the same way I had killed the gray wolf. Why did these two die when the rest of the wolves survived every attack? Something howled in the distance. Crimson and I whirled toward the forest. I shoved the bolt into the pouch with the other one and hurled myself onto Crimson’s back. We fled, leaving the large wolf carcass for Favreau to clean up in the morning, if he ever chose to leave his house again. I had to find out how Pierre forged these two bolts. And I had to live long enough to do it. 209 23. We charged through the forest, pounding over twigs and pine needles as the rain turned to mist. Back to the village and to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne, the only home I had now. How long it would remain a home, I couldn’t know. But Pierre and his parents had to let me stay at least one more night! Another howl rang through the trees, closer than the first. The wolves had picked up our scent. Crimson thundered ahead without any prodding. My sides ached from the jarring ride, but 210 I refused to restrain him. Not with so much forest to cover. The howling increased, from two or more wolves. They could be organizing themselves, picking out a trail, searching for us. They would find us in minutes. Well before we reached the village. A growing chorus of howls rose as we raced on, sweating in the fresh humidity. They would surround us again, in greater numbers. This time, they would not hold back. “Helena? Helena!” I gasped. Had someone called me? I wished it was possible, this deep into the forest. I tugged on Crimson’s reins for a moment. “Helena! Helena, is that you?” I froze in the saddle. Crimson stamped his hooves, eager to flee. I scanned the area, searching between black trees. A horse approached from the fog, its rider bearing a lantern. The trotting silhouette took on a dark shape, lightening as it drew closer. Beneath the wide-brimmed hat, Father Vestille’s eyes held a look of horror. “Helena! Helena, what’s happened? Are you all right?” I couldn’t answer as he came toward us, appearing from nowhere. I was too exhausted to think. “Helena, what’s wrong? I’ve been searching everywhere for you.” The wolves howled again, less than half a mile away. I jerked at the sound. 211 Father Vestille studied the woods behind us. “You went after them, didn’t you? The wolves.” I said nothing. He turned sharply at another shrill howl. “They’re closing in. Come. My hovel is nearby.” He turned and took Crimson’s reins, leading us away at a fast trot. I said nothing, did nothing to resist. The battle and blood and terror left me numb and aching. I only wanted to sleep. To sleep without dreams or nightmares. We continued through the woods at a steady pace. Father Vestille focused on the muddy path, seeming to ignore the wolves’ terrible howls. We entered the little clearing where his house stood, a sturdy structure of clay and large stones, small but protected. For the first time since my childhood, the sight of Father Vestille’s hovel warmed my heart. A place to lie down and rest, where the wolves could not break in. I was so intent on returning to Monsieur Leóne’s shop that I had never considered retreating to Father Vestille’s home. Of course, I would never have accepted his invitation tonight if I wasn’t so desperate. He led us to his stable behind the cottage and jumped down from his saddle. He looked about, then led his Palomino into its stall, closed the gate and moved to the pile of hay beside it. I sat atop Crimson, heart pounding, chest heaving. The wolves would find this stable any moment. But I waited, my mind and body numb. Waited for Father Vestille to hurry! 212 Even if I hid in the stone house, the wolves would pass by here soon and catch Crimson’s scent. My throat went dry as I imagined them feeding on his flanks while I drifted off to sleep in the warm cottage. We couldn’t stay here. We would have to race on to the village and take our slim chances. Father Vestille set down his lantern and grabbed a pitchfork from the wall. Then he started to rake and pitch hay aside in a mad rush. I froze, exhausted and horrified at his sudden desire to clean. His own fear had driven him mad. He cleared the hay in front of the stalls and set the pitchfork back in place. Two narrow wooden doors, over twelve feet across, had been built into the floor. I blinked. “What is that?” He glanced about once more, then pulled up on the ropes attached to each door handle. Hay and dust fell from them, making my nose twitch. I waved it away and squinted at the wooden ramp extending beneath them. It led deep into the earth below Father Vestille’s hovel. He retrieved his lantern and beckoned us forward. Crimson took a cautious step, then permitted Father Vestille to lead him by his reins down the broad ramp. I expected to duck my head as we descended, but found that even Crimson could stand upright on the ramp and in the long musty room below. A dust-laden cot stood in a cobwebbed corner, opposite some wooden crates of ammunition and gunpowder in the far corner. 213 “The man who sold me this property was a retired soldier,” Father Vestille said in an urgent hush. “He built this underground shelter during the Spanish War, to hide supplies and weapons. I’ve since used it to hide refugees, but not since the War of the Territories.” Near the cot sat a sturdy, long forgotten rocking chair. In addition to soldiers, this place had housed families and mothers with small children. Who had Father Vestille hidden down here? Crimson snorted at something on the far right. I wrinkled my nose at the molded hay strewn across the floor, next to a hitching post built into the wall. This cellar had been designed to hide horses as well as their riders. A true shelter. Sheer genius. “I’ll clean that out of here and get some fresh hay in the morning,” Father Vestille said, setting his lantern on a table. “I’m afraid you’ll have to endure the odor for tonight. Come. Let’s get you cleaned up so you can rest.” I climbed down, but ignored Father Vestille’s offered hand. Instead, I led Crimson to the hitching post, letting Father Vestille hurry back up the ramp to pull both doors shut. He tramped back down as I removed Crimson’s saddle to let him bed down beside the old hay. He gave no argument, showing the same exhaustion I felt. I turned back to Father Vestille. He paled. “Helena, what – what happened? Who did this to you?” He wasn’t staring at the blood or patches of wolf fur or even the manure staining my clothes. 214 Only the trousers that shamelessly exposed my legs to the world. “I did,” I said weakly. “What?” He stared as though I had told him I stuck my hands into a fire. “I can’t explain right now. I just – just want to rest.” He gaped at me for a moment longer, then recovered. “Of course, of course.” He moved to the old cot and lit a candle on the table beside it. “Let me clean this off so you can lie down.” “There’s no need,” I said, dropping backward onto the mattress and sending up a cloud of old dust. I shut my eyes and shielded my nose. I couldn’t get any filthier. “Helena. We should clean you up …” “I just want … to sleep …” The wolves howled from the forest above us, their cries now faint. I opened my eyes to see Father Vestille studying the ceiling. He listened intently for a moment, then turned back to me. “All right, Helena. I’ll be back for you in the morning. Get some rest. And … tomorrow, we can talk. All right?” I didn’t answer or make any promise. I just stared back at him, tired and weak. He nodded, as if we had agreed on something, and stepped away. He left the candle burning for me, to give off a dim light. Finally safe, finally free for a few hours, I shut my eyes and descended into heavy sleep. 215 24. I awoke with a start as something pounded in the darkness. I sat up in bed and blinked, trying to distinguish shapes and remember where I was. Had I returned to Pierre’s loft? My head ached as if something was hammering my skull. The pounding continued from above. I squinted in the hazy light. The candle had burned down to a fuming spark, but dusty rays of light shone through cracks and holes in the ceiling. “Helena, are you awake?” Father Vestille’s voice was muffled. 216 “I’m –,” I started, hearing the harsh rasp of my voice. I cleared my throat and called louder. “I’m awake. You can come down.” One of the long shaft doors creaked open, shedding more light on the tiered ramp. Something surged inside me, a strange sense of hope and freedom that I couldn’t understand. Then Father Vestille’s boots descended the thin boards of the ramp, carrying a tray of food. He wore plain tan trousers and suspenders with a linen shirt. I wrinkled my brow, feeling even more like an intruder. I had rarely seen him without his priestly robe, not since I was a child. He looked tired and worried. “Good morning,” he said. He moved past Crimson, who was rousing himself from the floor, as I sat up in bed. He set the tray on a small table beside the cot. Warm bread and cheese and smoked sausage. The welcome smells nearly overcame the cellar’s musty odor. My stomach rumbled as I closed my dry mouth. Why did I suddenly feel so safe here? Not just in this secret hideaway, but under Father Vestille’s care? He pulled up a stool beside the bed, sliding it past the rocking chair. “Go ahead, Helena. I’m sure you must be famished.” I swallowed. “Thank you.” I started in, seizing the bread with a ferocity that startled me. I didn’t realize how hungry I was. How tired and sore. I felt like a wounded stray puppy Father Vestille had rescued from the forest. 217 He watched me, saying nothing. As though he wanted to make certain I ate. “Do you mind if I join you?” I chewed on one side of my mouth to answer. “Of course. It’s your food.” He smiled. Then he closed his eyes and crossed himself, mouthing a silent prayer. I stopped chewing, feeling ashamed. It never occurred to me to give thanks for the meal, as I normally would. I was too hungry. He lifted his head and opened his eyes. “I’m sorry I didn’t pray.” He shrugged. “The Lord understands. I expect you’ve had quite an ordeal.” I chewed quietly on the bread. He glanced at my legs, covered only by trousers, then looked away, embarrassed. He met my eyes. “Can you tell me what happened?” I kept chewing. He waited for me to swallow. “… It’s more than I can explain.” He frowned, studying my face. “Very well.” He took a piece of bread and sliced off an end of sausage. “I’ll bring down a wash basin for you to bathe, whenever you’re ready. Or you can bathe upstairs and I’ll wait outside.” I sat up at the thought of leaving the dingy cellar to clean up. “If – you don’t mind – yes, I would rather go upstairs.” He gave a curt nod. “I’ll show you where the sponges are. And I’ll start cleaning down here. Or I can wait outside, if you wish, and watch for any uninvited guests.” 218 I lowered my gaze, eyeing the plate of warm food. I never expected him to accommodate me so much after I ran off last night. Especially with the way I now looked. He had no idea what I had done or what monsters were chasing me. Yet he welcomed me into his home without demanding any explanation. “Thank you. But I don’t think they’ll be looking for me now.” “Hopefully not.” His eyes looked kind but wounded. “Are you all right, Helena?” I curled my lips shut. I wanted to tell someone what happened. What I had discovered about the wolves, whatever that was, exactly. I needed to learn what made those two bolts kill the wolves when the others failed. But Father Vestille was the last person I wanted to confess my activities to, let alone boast about them. “I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you for your hospitality. It’s very kind of you.” He seemed ready to say something, then shook his head slightly. “You can stay here if you wish. I’ll keep you hidden. My home will always be open to you, no matter where you go or what you do. I just want you to be safe.” “Thank you. I’ll consider that.” I hardly knew what to say. After I had rejected all of his hospitality, he still offered me a home. His home. Or at least, the secret longhouse hidden beneath it. My own underground refuge, for as long as I wanted. Somehow it seemed right to hide here. Despite its musty odor, it felt so comfortable and 219 familiar. As if I belonged here, where nothing could touch me. I studied the dusty rocking chair as Father Vestille leaned forward on the awkward stool to tear off some bread. “Who did you hide down here during the war?” He blinked in surprise. “I hid you.” I nearly choked on my bread. He leaned forward anxiously, but I held up a hand as I chewed and swallowed. “What?” “You and your parents, and your Grand’Mere. When foreigners started raiding the villages, they were hunting for soldiers. Like your father. This underground shelter was a secret that the former owner shared with me, for just such a purpose. We’ve all kept it secret ever since.” He shook his head, recalling troubled times. “Your father came home frantic, the last survivor of his regiment. Not certain whether to fight the invaders or protect your mother, who was with child – you. He decided, wisely, to protect his family. You were born down here, with your Grand’Mere serving as midwife. You all lived here nearly two years, while the invaders tried to secure territory up above. Your father snuck out at night on several occasions to wreak havoc on their equipment and supplies, then retreated back here to safety.” “Papa hid here and snuck out to battle the enemy at night?” “One successful ambush after another,” Father Vestille said. “He took great risks, but he always returned home safe to your mother, here.” Just like I did last night, I thought. 220 I stared back at the rocking chair, laden with years of dust. I tried to imagine Mama rocking an infant in it. Tried to imagine her wondering how long she would be confined to this underground prison, struggling to keep her child hidden. To keep me hidden. As she wondered if the invasion would ever end, and whether Papa would return that night, or leave her and Grand’Mere to raise me all alone. Father Vestille folded his hands over his mouth. “The invading forces never bothered me. I was only a priest, submitting to their rule. So I could keep you all safe.” He lowered his gaze. “That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. Your parents invited me here from Burgundy, and let me stay with them until I could find a place of my own. This place. I owe them a great deal.” I felt cobwebs lifting from my memories. “I remember a wide door opening in the ceiling,” I said. “I remember sunlight pouring in.” He smiled. “We all celebrated when the King’s soldiers arrived to secure order. We were free. Free to return to our separate homes. But we kept meeting every week at your home.” Until the wolf attacks, when you decided to spend your time visiting safer provinces, I thought. Still, it was clear my family owed him a great debt. I owed him a great debt. “I never knew that,” I said. He ate his bread and sausage while I broke off a chunk of cheese. We chewed in silence. When we finally finished, he gathered up the tray and moved to a far corner of the room, where a 221 ladder stood upright near the wall. It ended at the dusty ceiling. “Let me show you where the basin and sponges are. Then I’ll get some oats for your horse and start tidying up down here.” He moved the tray to one arm and started up the ladder. I stood, amazed. “This leads up to your home?” “Of course,” he said. He pounded with one fist against the ceiling and pushed open a door. Light poured in from above. I felt the same rush of memories from childhood, feelings of instant safety and freedom. Father Vestille slid the tray up onto the floor above, then brushed away clumps of dust from the opening. “It was designed well, to hide soldiers and refugees as well as weapons. If anyone attacked, there was another means of escape. However, I figured it would be best to enter through the ramp we used last night. I didn’t want to startle you. You can eat meals with me or down here. Or you can stay somewhere else and come here if you need refuge. Whatever you choose.” He ascended the ladder and stepped out of sight. I hesitated to follow him. He had invited me into his home many times, but I had never looked or smelled so foul. With my strange and wanton appearance, I expected him to deny he even knew me. I rose from the cot, feeling stiff pain throughout my body, especially my ankles and lower back. I didn’t realize how much last night’s ordeal took out of me until I tried to simply stand 222 up. Crimson went back to sleep on the floor. He must have felt the same exhaustion, or perhaps more. I climbed the ladder, stepping gingerly on bruises and blisters that stung the soles of my feet. I clutched the rung and grit my teeth. If I planned to continue this crusade, my body would have to adapt. The door in the ceiling opened onto a corner of Father Vestille’s front room, warm and free of dust. I breathed in clean air and felt my body relax. He had few furnishings, but they looked comfortable. Three cushioned chairs, a breakfast table, a reading table with a lantern and his Bible beside another leatherbound book, a broad round rug, some portraits of the Christ and of some friends, and a stoop leading up to the front door. The outer porch was all I had ever seen of this place. Who could imagine it hid such a refreshing home? I looked back at the wall of portraits, seeing one that looked familiar. I stepped forward and saw that it was my parents, with me as a child, only a few years old. Mama held me on her lap, unable to contain her smile. Papa sat beside her, strong and upright, lifting his stiff chin as if daring anyone to attack his family. I forced down emotions, refusing to let myself cry. Then I realized, he had no paintings of any other friends. He kept this portrait alone, alongside the portrait of the Christ. A picture of Mama and Papa and me from long ago, before I was scarred. I tightened my lips and stood taller. 223 Father Vestille noticed me staring at the portrait. “You were only four then,” he said. “That was painted by a young man who came through the village, a couple of years after the war. Your father paid to have it made and it was remarkable. He could tell I wanted it badly, but I would never ask. I still feel it should have been hanging in your home all these years, but he insisted I keep it. He told me they would see it often enough, every time they came over.” I felt a lump of shame in my throat. I had never even seen it. I turned back to the reading table, picking up the leatherbound book. “Is this a book of Latin translation or something?” He deftly extracted it from my hands, so suddenly and gracefully it felt like it had vanished into thin air. “No, this is nothing,” he said, sliding it beneath his Bible. “Just an old journal of personal notes.” I swallowed. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to be so nosy. I’ve just – I’ve never been here before.” “It’s all right, Helena. You have nothing to apologize for.” He pointed at a large oval washtub against the wall. A bucket was set beside it with a rag slung over its rim. “The washbasin is here. I’ll fetch some water to heat up and fill it for you. Should have it ready in less than an hour.” He pointed at the rear door. “My room is in the back, if you need more rest while you’re waiting.” “Father Vestille. My clothes are filthy. I can’t lie down on your bed.” 224 He didn’t look at me as he grabbed a bucket from the corner. “I can wash the bedsheets later. Right now, I’m caring for you.” “Don’t you need to know what happened? Where I went after the funeral?” He started toward the front door. “I’m sure you’ll tell me when you’re ready, if you wish to.” “Why did you ask if I went after the wolves last night?” “I heard them howling. Obviously, they were chasing you.” “But why did you hide me underground? You don’t mind me being here now. Why didn’t you take us straight into the house last night?” He stopped with the door half-open. Standing like a statue, he stared at the stoop in silence. Then he slowly closed the door and stepped down, setting the bucket on the floor. “Helena, sit down.” “I told you, I’m filthy. I can’t sit on these nice –.” “Helena, please,” he implored in a mournful tone. “I need to speak with you.” He sat in one cushioned chair. I sat in the one opposite him, struggling to ignore the mud and manure of my cloak staining its cushion. Father Vestille folded his hands and stared at the floorboards. “I hid you underground because – I thought others might be chasing you. Along with the wolves.” 225 I stared at his balding head. Wondering what secrets he held inside it. “You know something about these attacks.” He looked up, his eyes desperate and sad. “Helena. I don’t know what happened to you as a child. I don’t know what killed your parents and Suzette.” “Father Vestille, I think I –.” “— but I have my suspicions.” Blood surged through my cheeks like fire. “I’ve heard many rumors over the years. Of attacks on women and children in this area and other provinces. In Gevaudan and Dijon and several villages throughout France. Attacks by wolves.” My breath grew heavier. My heart beat harder. “And not ordinary wolves. Witnesses describe them as something larger than a wolf, but similar in appearance. The largest wolves are about five feet long, but these are more than six feet long, standing over four feet high.” I stifled an inward gasp. He was describing the size of the wolves I had fought last night. The size of the wolf that scarred me when I was seven. “People also claim that these wolves act strangely. Almost cunning in their approach, the way they avoid men and their weapons. Almost stealthy in their patience and strategy, attacking victims when they’re alone and most vulnerable. Some insist they have noticed these wolves waiting several nights for an opportunity to seize a 226 small child, the moment she ventured outside her home.” In my mind, I pictured Favreau’s farmhouse and the thinning ivory nightgown of his young daughter. I felt a shiver in my skin. “What are these creatures?” Father Vestille shook his head, looking helpless. “I have no idea. But there have been rumors of other activity in those same areas. Some people claim there is a cult that worships wolves, believing the animals to be superior to men in both power and cunning. This cult calls itself the Lycanthru.” He held my locked gaze. “Many believe the Lycanthru are responsible for these attacks.” I could hear my breath now. Feel my chest heaving up and down. “How?” He shook his head again. “I don’t know. Some say they capture wolves and practice witchcraft on them. They believe the Lycanthru have the power to transform these wolves into the creatures that attacked those women and children.” Every nerve of my body was on fire. “How do I find them?” “You don’t!” he barked. He struggled to calm himself, shaking. “Helena. I’m telling you this to help you understand. These men are practicing witches. They’re performing rituals on wolves to make them kill people.” I stifled my fear. “Like Mama and Papa? And Suzette and Francois?” He frowned. “Yes. And like you, if you keep after them. Do you understand?” 227 I stood to my feet. “Someone has to stop them, whatever they’re doing. Someone has to make this stop.” He rose with me. “But you are not that person, Helena.” “You don’t think I can face them? You’re wrong. You would know how wrong you were if you saw me last night. I killed two of them.” “Two of how many? There have been over a hundred attacks reported, just in the surrounding villages. Do you expect to hunt them all down?” He stopped himself. Then he took me by the shoulders. “Helena. I know you’ve suffered. I’ve suffered, too, though not as greatly. I lost your father and mother and your sweet sister. I don’t want to lose you, too.” I felt my cheek twitch, but I steadied my resolve. “I’ll see to it that you don’t.” “It’s not that simple, Helena.” He turned from me, wringing his hands. “What happens when they come after you? Were they chasing you when I found you?” I said nothing, but shuddered. “You’re dealing with something far more dangerous than you realize.” I bit my lip. “Maybe I am. But someone has to.” He hung his head, defeated. “I cannot tell you what to do. I can only beg you to stay away from those people. These attacks have been occurring for decades, and no one has yet found a way to stop them.” 228 I thought of the two crossbow bolts in my satchel bag, my senses on fire. “I might have found it.” He blinked and narrowed his eyes at me. “How, Helena?” “I’ll look into it further and let you know.” I knew better than to tell him anything more. He already had little faith in my abilities. What would he think of my report that two bolts had killed wolves when all of the other bolts failed, and I just needed to figure out why. “All right, Helena.” His eyebrows lifted in a shrug of surrender. He stood as if shouldering a heavy weight. “Please consider what I said. And don’t do anything foolish.” His warning had come far too late, but I said nothing. “Rest in my bed for a while. I’ll fetch water and heat the bath. You can make this your home, if you wish.” He frowned again. “You are – You’re the only one left of your family. I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Please stay safe.” I swallowed. “I will. I promise.” He nodded, pursing his lips. As though he accepted my vow but knew I wouldn’t give up my dangerous plans. He retrieved the bucket and moved to the front door, creaking it open to scan for intruders before stepping outside. I felt a strange emptiness in the silent house. Father Vestille was the last person I wanted in my life, especially now. But he might understand my loss better than anyone else. In an 229 odd way, he was the closest thing to a family I had left. I sighed, dismissing my grief. His hovel kept me warm and secure. That was all that mattered. If this Lycanthru cult was behind the attacks, they would never search for me in a priest’s home, let alone his secret underground retreat. I could no longer sleep in the loft at L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Not after attacking the wolves last night. Some villagers might expect me to seek help from Pierre, and that expectation could endanger him and his parents. I would have to avoid meeting him too often. After I returned there today, of course. 230 25. By late afternoon, I had bathed and eaten a little more. I even slept another few hours in Father Vestille’s underground retreat, which smelled much nicer once he finished his cleaning. After I woke, I cleaned and fed Crimson, who seemed to feel as fresh and alive as I did, eager to gallop again. As we pounded toward the blacksmith shop, a few villagers cast odd glances at my bright hood and burnt umber horse. They would surely 231 have gaped at my offending trousers as well, if they knew I was a girl. The odor of burning iron filled the inside of L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Pierre looked up from his smelting pot and quickly extinguished the flame, setting his tools aside. He met me with eyes full of panic. “Red! Where did you go? Where have you been all day? Father Vestille was searching for you for hours, and I’ve been –.” “He found me,” I said. “I’m –.” I stopped short, catching myself before I announced I was staying with Father Vestille. Pierre was the one person I could confide in. But to protect him and myself, I had to keep that retreat secret. From everyone. “What?” “I’m not sure where I’ll be staying now.” He looked wounded. “Red. You can stay here as long as you want.” “That’s not entirely safe. I appreciate the offer, and I may take advantage of it now and then. But your loft can’t be a permanent home. It will draw too much attention.” “From who? I don’t care what anyone in town thinks.” “Not from people in town.” “Red, what’s happened?” “I found them.” Color drained from his cheeks. “The wolves?” “And I fought them. About twelve of them.” 232 He glared at me, trembling slightly. He looked me up and down, apparently checking for cuts or missing limbs. “Are you – Are you all right? You – You got through it.” “Yes,” I said, sounding more annoyed than I should have. Pierre knew I was a better hunter than most men. But no one, man or woman, would likely survive an attack from a dozen wolves. If it weren’t for Father Vestille, I would be dead. I softened, touching his hand. “I’m fine, Pierre. Thank you for your concern, and your help. Everything you gave me.” He released an anxious sigh. “How did the blades work for you?” “Fine, Pierre,” I said. “They work just fine.” “And the new crossbow?” I lifted the repeating crossbow for him to see. “It worked perfectly. Twice. That’s why I need your help.” He took the crossbow and studied it with a quizzical expression. “It only fired twice?” “No. It fired thirteen bolts.” He blinked at me, looking even more amazed. “You missed?” Heat rose in my cheeks and I stuck my fists on my hips. “I sank every single bolt into those things.” “Oh,” he said, satisfied with the answer to one puzzle but still confounded by the remaining one. I calmed myself and realized he was complimenting me. He believed his own repeating 233 crossbow was more likely to fail than I was likely to miss. “Most of my shots would have killed a normal wolf. But these things kept coming. The bolts had no effect on them. Except for these two.” I held up the grimy bolts I had pulled from my satchel. He took them from me and squinted closely. “What’s so special about these two?” “That’s what I need you to find out. Do you make every bolt the same way?” “Yes,” he said. Then he seemed to recall something and looked a bit ashamed. “Although – the process is the same, but – we don’t always use the same material. You asked me to make you extra bolts, so I used the metal we had in supply. I had to mix in some other metal for some of them, to give you a few more.” “How many bolts did you make that way?” “Only two or three.” We gaped at one another. Tugging on his work gloves, Pierre grabbed a rag and dunked it into a steaming pot of water. He squeezed it out, then used it to wipe most of the blood and grime from each bolt. He took them to a smelting pot at the opposite end of his work table, adding some kindling to heat a flame beneath it. Then he held the bolts over it, melting them slowly. After a full minute, I watched a single drip fall into the pot. I stepped aside to sit on a bench. This would take some time. Beyond the furnace, the rear door of Pierre’s house opened. Monsieur Leóne came out, marching straight across the room. “Pierre, I need 234 you to finish those stokers for Monsieur Denue by Friday.” Pierre turned on his heel to stand at attention. “Yes, sir.” Monsieur Leóne studied his son a moment, then noticed me sitting quietly in the corner. “Helena? What are you –?” He blinked hard at my legs. I broke the silence. “I came to ask Pierre for some help. Something’s wrong with my bolts.” He seemed to be struggling for words. I crossed my legs and tried to pull the outer edges of my cloak over them. It didn’t help. He seemed just as perplexed, just as offended. “Helena …” He started to speak, wrinkled his brows some more, and shut his mouth. He tried again. “Helena, I – I’m so sorry for your loss. Your mother and Suzette, they were wonderful people.” I stared back, feeling numb. “Thank you.” He couldn’t tear his eyes away from my masculine garb. “Do you – need anything? Food or – clothes?” “No, thank you. I’m well taken care of.” He forced his mouth to close. Then at last, he turned and walked away, but stopped to address his son. “Pierre, I need to pick up some more iron. The miners finally broke through and found a rich supply, so we won’t run short again. I’ll return in two hours.” He glanced sideways at me, then turned back to Pierre. “Can you handle everything while I’m away?” “Of course, Papa.” 235 Monsieur Leóne gave a curt nod, blinked at me twice more, then left through the door to their home. Pierre looked irritated. “First time he’s ever asked me if I can handle the shop by myself. I usually do when he’s away.” “I don’t think he approves of my wardrobe,” I said flatly. Pierre shrugged. “Well – it’s a little different.” I looked away, feeling even more isolated. But I no longer cared what Monsieur Leóne thought of me. Or what anyone else thought. Pierre studied the falling drips of metal. “Nothing unusual so far. Regular iron, like we always use. Some lead, though, showing here. All right, so this one had some other metal mixed in. But I can’t see how that would matter, when – wait – all right, some copper. Traces of silver …” Blood surged through my shoulders. As though I was meant to pay attention to that detail. As though I had been given the answer. Silver. Francois said his ax blade was made of silver. His blade only grazed the wolf, but had killed it instantly. “Try the other one,” I said. He narrowed his eyes at me, confused. “I haven’t finished studying this one.” “It’s enough. Melt the other one.” He frowned, but set his tools and the first bolt aside. Within a few minutes, he found what I expected him to find. 236 “– some lead in this one, too – Some traces of silver. Must have just poured everything in at once. Nothing else yet, but –.” “It’s silver,” I said. “What?” “Silver. That’s what kills them.” “Red, that makes no sense. A silver bolt couldn’t hurt a wolf any more than an ordinary bolt.” “You should tell them that.” “But how’s that possible?” “I don’t know. But these bolts killed them, and so did Francois Revelier’s silver ax. Killed it easily, just like the two I shot last night. That must be the difference.” “Red, silver isn’t any kind of poison.” “It might be to them.” He shrugged again. “All right. How can we know for sure?” I sat rigid on the bench and stiffened my lip. “Only one way. I’ll have to start using silver bolts.” “You’re going after them again?” “Yes. But this time, I’ll be better armed.” “Red, if you’re wrong, they’ll kill you!” “They’ll kill us all, anyway,” I said hotly. “That’s what no one seems willing to grasp. They’re not going to stop. They’ll keep coming. They’ll keep getting stronger and more numerous and killing everyone they feel like killing. We can die trying to stop them or sit at home and wait for them to come. I’m not waiting.” “But – silver? That’s impossible, Red.” 237 “So are these wolves, over six feet long and able to …” He waited for me to finish. “Able to what?” I almost said they could talk and stand upright. Something I never shared with anyone outside my family, not even Pierre. At least, not after the week of the attack, after seeing the confused faces of Father Vestille and Francois when I told them what happened. I couldn’t bear to receive that same look from Pierre. “… able to organize themselves to attack in large numbers,” I finished. “They staked out that pig farmer’s house to get at his daughter.” “What makes you think that?” “There were plenty of wolves on hand last night to attack. Yet for the last two weeks, they only took one pig at a time. They didn’t care about the pigs. They only wanted to draw out the farmer and his little girl. Once she came outside, the wolves showed up in full force.” “But why would wolves attack a little girl when they could go after a whole herd of pigs?” I thought of Father Vestille’s story about the Lycanthru, practicing witchcraft on wolves. “They’re not wolves. They’re some other sort of creatures, under some kind of spell. I’ll need silver bolts. My blades and other weapons need to be silver, too. Even my grappling hook, just in case.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “We don’t have that much silver to spare, Red. How much does it take?” 238 I peered into the smelting pot at the sparse drops of melted silver. “How much was in those bolts?” “Barely a trace.” “Then that’s all I need. Just a little on the tip of each bolt and the sharp edges of each blade.” Pierre rubbed the back of his neck. “Red, suppose you’re right. Suppose this will kill them. They’re not likely to show up at that farm again. How will you even find them?” I thought of Touraine, telling me about the men who delighted in reports of wolf attacks. Men who might belong to the Lycanthru. “I have an idea where to start.” 239 26. A few hours later, after I ate some bread and pork prepared by Pierre and rested a little more in his loft, I rode toward La Maison de Touraine. Pierre had outfitted all of my weapons while I slept, gilding each new bolt and knife edge with silver. He said his father would be furious to learn he had melted down other customers’ works to make new bolts for me, putting their orders further behind. But he planned to tell him he found some imperfections and needed extra time to finish. I thanked him for it. 240 It was near nightfall. Villagers started to tug their cloaks about their shoulders as they passed by in the street. Many of them stared at me with a fresh sense of surprise. Instead of wrinkling their noses at me, they stopped in their tracks and followed my movements, almost in a sense of wonder. As though it had suddenly become admirable to wear a giant red cloak. I rode up to the hitching post at La Maison and left Crimson to stand beside it. I patted his neck. He had slept well at Father Vestille’s last night and gotten more water and oats from Pierre. He seemed fit and ready for whatever might come tonight. I pushed through the thick doors of the tavern. Raucous conversations stopped. I scanned the room. Every eye fell on me. I stood at the door, uncertain what to do. Were they staring at my scars? At the red hood? I stepped forward, listening to my own slow boot steps on the floorboards as I approached the bar counter. People began to murmur and resume their excited conversations, now strangely hushed. Were they talking about me? At the bar, Touraine wiped the counter where a man had just spilled his beer. As I drew near, the gaping man slid off his stool, filling my face with his alcohol breath. He continued to stare as he turned in a circle and backed away, forgetting the rest of his drink on the counter. “So,” Touraine said quietly. “You’ve returned.” 241 “I seem to be popular this evening.” His broad shoulders heaved and sighed. “Yes, you are. You went to Favreau’s farm last night.” It was not a question. “I might have.” “You fought five or six large wolves there, killed two of them. They found the bodies this morning.” “There were about a dozen, actually. They chased me into the –.” “You’re him, aren’t you?” interrupted a well-dressed man. His large elbow came to rest on the far end of the counter. His voice was smooth, almost mocking. “You’re that red rider. The one who fought all the wolves at that farmhouse.” I turned slowly toward him, keeping my head down, saying nothing. It seemed prudent to let him think I was a man. Even more prudent when I took a good look at him out of the corner of my eye. Tall and strong, with a broad black moustache. He held his drink at his side, grinning as if he was somehow challenging me. Not doubting me, but wanting to test my abilities. “Move along, Brocard,” Touraine said. “Those are just rumors. How could one man take on a pack of wolves by himself?” The man ignored Touraine and didn’t budge. He sipped his drink, studying me. “Those wolves. They’re dangerous, you know. You’re lucky to be alive.” His face lit up like the devil, or something worse. As if he could picture the wolves tearing me apart. “I’m Jean Paul Brocard. I farm 242 cattle and do some business in the village. I trade livestock, horses, weapons, tools. Anything a man might need.” He raised his eyebrows with an unconvincing show of friendliness. “Perhaps I could outfit you some day, Monsieur. A man who fights off a whole pack of wolves will surely need help now and again. Extra food for your horse. Extra bolts for that crossbow.” Touraine cleared his throat, looking nervous. “I really don’t think the man’s interested, Brocard.” The smiling man edged closer along the bar counter. “You might discover I’m a good man to have on your side, Monsieur. You need someone you can count on, to help you survive. When the odds are overwhelming.” He slid his drink along ahead of him, stopping it near me. He sat on the stool beside mine and leaned forward, folding his fists as he tried to look beneath my hood. “Because those wolves will come looking for you, you know. All of them. And they’ll find you. And tear you into small pieces. Who will help you then?” I stood and raised my crossbow to his face. Every conversation halted again as Brocard lifted his chin. His Adam’s apple swallowed hard. Then he smiled wider, as if to cover his anxiety. I understood, since I had drawn my crossbow in order to keep him from seeing my shoulders trembling. I focused on steadying the weapon, the way Papa had taught me to do when we were hunting, to push aside my fear. Brocard lifted his palms in gracious surrender. I allowed him to take a step back. “I see 243 it is a ‘No’ for now,” he said. “We’ll talk again another time, Monsieur.” He continued to back away, hands raised as he grinned. I turned toward the watching crowd. They all kept silent. A few of them turned away as I met their gaze. “Yes, you’re popular all right,” Touraine said. “Be glad I’m not telling anyone you’re a girl. A strange young girl at that, dressing like a man and fighting wolves in the dead of night. They’d never leave you alone.” I lowered my crossbow, concealing it beneath my cloak. “Am I really that strange?” He pursed his lips. “Have you seen a mirror lately?” “But you meet all sorts of people here. Even women. Am I actually the strangest girl you’ve ever met?” He considered for a moment. “Ever?” I nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, you are. Just watch yourself. Men like Brocard are charming enough, but he’s part of a dangerous crowd.” I resumed my place on the stool. “Dangerous, how?” “Excuse me, Monsieur.” I flinched at the gruff voice. A tall man marched straight at me. He wore the broad blue cloak of the village police. “I hear you were involved in an incident at Monsieur Favreau’s farm last night.” I kept my head down a little, hiding beneath the hood as best I could while I studied him. He looked strong and severe, with inky black 244 hair beneath his broad-brimmed hat. He squinted at me with narrow eyes. Eyes that shone blue-gray.",

      "content": "“Yes, I will,” he repeated, and was gone. I waited to hear him descend the last step of the wooden ladder before I lowered my hands. I resumed dressing in his mother’s satin gown. It was the only suitable outfit that wasn’t tattered with age. A full-length mirror stood beside the wardrobe. The dress would work, though it seemed more suited for a ball than a funeral. I donned her red cloak and tied it about my neck. “Let me know when you’re ready, all right, Red?” Pierre called from below. I stared at my reflection. At the red cloak around my head and shoulders. The bright color I had been forbidden to wear for nine years. Ever since the wolves began to rule my life and the lives of everyone around me. Wearing this cloak gave me a surge of energy inside, a sense of strength I had never known, even when hunting. 160 “Yes, Pierre,” I called back. “I’m ready now.” “Here she is,” Pierre said, waving a hand toward Madame Leóne as he gently guided me toward her with his hand on my back. Madame Leóne bent forward in her elegant homemade gown, spun of midnight blue silk with an embroidered bodice. The exquisite sort of dress Mama might have made for me, if I were wearing it for someone else’s funeral. She clutched me to herself as we stood outside la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu. “I’m so sorry, dear,” she said, cradling me. I remained rigid, ashamed that I could not return her tender hug. All of my emotions had been burned to ashes, leaving me empty. I kept still and silent as a harsh wind began to whip at our skirts, warning of the approaching storm. She finally broke off the embrace, as cautiously as she had started it, and offered a weak smile. She struggled to clear her throat. “That’s – such a beautiful cloak, Helena. Your mother would have loved to see you in it.” Monsieur Leóne emerged, holding open the door for us. “He’s about to start, Lisette,” he said in a subdued tone. “We should – .” He gaped at me. At my bright red cloak. “… Brianna …” he muttered. Madame Leóne turned sharply to him. “Oh, dear. Is that – ?” She glanced back at me, her eyes 161 wide. “I had no idea. But – it’s so beautiful, isn’t it, Frayne?” Monsieur Leóne continued to stare at me, not moving. “No one’s really – using it, Papa,” Pierre broke in slowly. “And Helena’s old enough to wear it. I just thought – .” Monsieur Leóne held up a hand, stopping him. “It’s fine,” he said. “Yes, she – she looks lovely. So sorry it’s – being worn for such a sad occasion.” He swallowed. “You’re welcome to the cloak, Helena. I believe – perhaps it’s right for you to have it.” He turned aside, staring at the dirt. Then regained his composure. “Come along. It’s – time to get things started.” “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” I sat quiet and still in the pew beside Pierre inside the church, watching Father Vestille prepare to give the eulogy and pray over the bodies of Mama and Suzette. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The caskets were closed. Nearly thirty people had assembled to pay honor to my family’s memory. As always, Duke Laurent’s presence in the second row gave the service added a significant prestige. His advisor, Monsieur Simonet, sat beside him, his usual frown now seeming appropriate. Father Vestille hung his head, slow to begin. Finally, he lifted his eyes, grimaced, and 162 spoke in a hoarse voice. “My friends …” He cleared his throat and started again. “My friends. Thank you for coming. We are here to lay to rest – the bodies of Celeste Basque and – her youngest daughter, Suzette Basque. Both brutally attacked by beasts earlier this morning.” He paused, closing his eyes. Gathering his breath. “Our hearts cannot be heavier. My heart cannot be heavier. To lose such a wonderful woman and her innocent child. The Basque family has been like my own family. They welcomed me into this community and into their home. Their kindness, their openness and hospitality, inspired me to be more open to others. To find ways to reach out and welcome neighbors and strangers, the way they welcomed me.” Father Vestille observed the silent coffins. He looked so sad, so defeated, as if he might struggle to lift his head. His voice choked. “Celeste and Suzette Basque have become – even closer to me these last few months, since – since Henri Basque died. He was also – He was also cruelly taken by a wolf. Their eldest daughter, Helena, is still with us. And I urge all of you to do whatever you can, anything you can, to show her support and comfort in this time of great loss. It’s more than anyone, especially a young girl like Helena, should be forced to bear.” I felt the eyes of others staring at me. Even Pierre glanced at me. To see my reaction. I ignored all of them, staring back at Father Vestille in stony silence. Memorizing each hollow word. 163 He stood a little taller, finding more of his voice. “But we must encourage ourselves, not only in the face of death, but in life. In all that we face, even in the midst of the most horrible tragedy, we must seek the face of the Lord and draw strength from him to continue with every task of daily life. With every disappointment, every grief, every threat –.” I rose from my seat. Father Vestille stopped. Covering the cream dress, I still wore the red cloak, which had drawn several curious stares when we entered the church. But no one dared criticize what I had chosen to wear for the burial of my remaining family. And no one would interfere with me now as I stepped toward the caskets. I stopped in front of the smaller one and stared down at it. I turned to Father Vestille. “Open it.” His skin paled like a phantom. “Helena. I – I know how horrible this is for you, but –.” “Open it.” He stood frozen behind the pulpit, with no idea how to respond. The rest of the crowd kept silent in their seats. I walked behind the wooden coffin. Peeling my hood back, I lifted the lid. Inside, a few pieces of Suzette’s body had been carefully laid. Each one stripped clean of the majority of decaying flesh and dried blood. I marveled at how quickly Father Vestille had gathered and prepared them. Each piece had been neatly arranged, the hand and partial skull and 164 ribcage exactly where they should be. Except that the lower part of the ribcage was a pile of fractured sticks. This was not my sister. Only her bones. My sister’s soul had ascended and I would not see her again until my own death. All that remained of her was this pile of lifeless flesh, which would never smile again, never run again, never laugh again. I faced the spectators. Neighbors, cousins, and friends I had not seen for months. I couldn’t even remember some of their names. Pierre and his parents, Duke Laurent and even Simonet, stared at me in shock, almost fear. I lifted Suzette’s skeletal hand up high, to show everyone it was no longer connected to her tiny wrist. Women squealed and nestled against their husbands, while mothers shielded their children’s eyes. I no longer cared. I met their stares, glaring back at them. I held the hand higher. “This … will end.” I laid the hand gently back in its place with the rest of my sister’s useless parts. Then I slammed the coffin lid down, letting it echo through the sanctuary. I secured my hood once more and marched past the stunned crowd toward the rear oak doors. Ignoring Father Vestille as he gaped from the front. Past Duke Laurent, Papa’s old friend, who seemed ready to stand and comfort or dissuade me, but wisely held his place. Past Pierre, wrinkling his brow with worry, as his parents looked on with stunned faces. 165 I pushed the double doors open and strode to Crimson, who snorted eagerly beside Pierre’s horse. I climbed onto his back and he lifted his hooves, as if sensing my urgency. We galloped off into the darkening afternoon as a storm threatened on the horizon. 166 18. I rode back to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and found the spare key beneath the stone near the front stoop, where I knew Monsieur Leóne kept it. I unlocked the shop’s front door and went inside, wondering if I might ruin the late Madame Leóne’s satin gown just by walking through the warm oily air. I didn’t climb up to the loft to rest or gather my thoughts. Instead, I lit a few candles and started rummaging through the shop. I had decided on my 167 next course of action. I just needed to work out the details. I was still gathering bolts and knives when I heard fast hooves approaching. I continued working as I recognized Diamond’s whinny from out front before Pierre burst through the door. “Red! Red, what are you doing?” “Preparing for a hunt.” I continued to pace the tables and shelves, selecting weapons. “I need your help, Pierre. I need a pair of boots.” “Boots?” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “What for? If you need slippers or sandals –.” “No. I’m going hunting and I need boots to get through the mud.” He remained confused. “I know you can hunt, but … boots? I mean –.” He shook his head, as if unable to speak. “What?” “Well – You’re a girl.” We stared at one another in silence. “I am aware of that. I need the boots, nevertheless.” “We don’t even sell boots.” “I know.” I bit my lip. “I was hoping you might have an extra pair I can borrow.” “Yeah. I guess. I have some old boots I meant to pass on to someone. They might fit you, if you really need them.” “Thank you.” He remained confused. “Still seems awfully odd for a girl.” I took another deep breath. “I also need a pair of trousers.” 168 He stared blankly at me. “I realize I’m still a girl,” I said. He studied the cold stone floor. “You’re going after those wolves, aren’t you?” I said nothing. The wind outside gave a shrill whistle. “Red, those things could kill you. We can get some men together and –.” “No, we can’t. Because none of them will go.” Pierre swallowed. “Then I’ll go with you.” “No, you won’t.” “Why not?” “Because.” I struggled for an answer. I would welcome anyone’s help to hunt those beasts. Anyone but Pierre. “Because if anything happens to me, I need you to tell the others what I’ve done. Apart from that, I’m binding you to secrecy.” “What? But, Red –!” “Promise me. Promise you won’t tell anyone. If they know, they’ll try to stop me, the same way you are. If they stop me, no one else will hunt them. Then more people will be killed and it will never stop. Promise me.” All the color drained from his face, leaving him a helpless phantom. “… all right. I promise.” “Thank you, Pierre.” He looked about the shop. “If you won’t change your mind, at least let me supply you with some good weapons.” “I’ve already started.” He studied my pile of knives and ammunition. “That’s a good start, but you’ll need 169 more. If you’re right, these are no ordinary wolves. You’ll need extraordinary weapons. Too bad you can’t have your own set of claws, to even it up.” I lifted my father’s crossbow. “This should help, at least.” “Yeah,” Pierre said, studying the crossbow with a curious look. He continued to eye it carefully as he spoke. “I’ve actually been working on something for you. I meant to surprise you with it, but – guess I’d better give it to you now. I also designed some tools people could use to guard their homes, with all these attacks.” He shook his head. “Never thought I’d be giving them all to you, but – Let me find those boots, and, uh – a pair of extra trousers.” “Where are you getting those?” “… from my wardrobe.” I swallowed, sharing his discomfort. “… thank you.” He nodded and stepped away. “Let me get you some gloves, too. Should come in handy out there. I’ll be right back.” He dimmed the candles, lit a lantern and headed toward his room at the rear of the shop. For a moment, I felt warmer inside, knowing Pierre would give me all the protection he could. In the upper room a few minutes later, I untied my red hood and let it fall to the bed, then removed my cream dress. I donned Pierre’s ivory tunic and deerskin trousers, feeling perverse. I had 170 not worn pants since I was seven, when I had to borrow clothes from Doctor Renoire’s son. I wondered what my parents would think if they could see me tonight. Mama would grieve and abandon all hope that I would ever become a sophisticated woman. Papa might share her concern, but feel a sense of pride that I was doing what I had to do. What someone had to do. As I thought of them, I stifled a half-choking sob. But I had vowed to stop crying. It felt strange, preparing to go out in public with folds of cloth surrounding my legs. At the same time, I felt freedom to move, back and forth, twisting and turning, with no skirt getting in the way. I tied the cloak about my neck and stood, moving my toes about in the boots, getting used to the feel of them. I stepped back a few quick paces, then forth again, then spun about. My cloak twirled after me, threatening to catch against me the way my skirt used to. But there was little comparison. I had to be careful how I moved, to avoid wrapping my shoulders tightly into the cloak, but I wouldn’t fall over myself or tangle my legs together the way I might in a dress. And I needed the cloak to feel less exposed. I smiled. In this outfit, I could run and leap without holding back. I could climb or descend a hill fast, and quickly position myself to launch a bolt in any direction. Most important, I could fight. I could dodge or strike someone without fear of stumbling or appearing unladylike. I caught my reflection in the mirror and my heart sank. 171 I looked like a man. Not even a handsome man, but a pretentious dandy with blonde locks. Scarred and disfigured by some accident, now trying to compensate for it by dressing in a flowing silk shirt, cuffed leather boots and an oversized red cloak. I looked horrendous. I took a deep breath and released it. What did it matter how I looked? I had lived with my ugly scars for nine years. What did it matter if I looked even worse? I kept staring at myself – at the strange person in the mirror – and wondered what would become of me, if I even survived this night. Would anyone mourn the strange scarred girl from the sheep farm outside the village? But if I didn’t go, who would even be left to mourn? Those beasts would return, again and again. Picking us off one by one until they had eaten their fill. They had to be stopped. They had to be killed. I donned the hood. It shaded my eyes and made me look fearsome. Otherwise, I felt naked with my legs uncovered. But there was nothing I could do about it. I left the dress in the wardrobe, my legs exposed for all the world to see. I prepared to venture into the forest, looking like an animal. I descended the ladder. I heard Pierre scraping metal against metal, sharpening something, as I clomped onto the wood floor and stepped past the furnace to face him. He gasped. “Helena. You look –.” “Even less attractive, I know.” “Uh, no. Just, uh – just different.” 172 “How I look doesn’t matter. What matters is how well I can move, and I can move more freely in this.” “Uh – All right.” He continued to stare at me. At my legs in particular. “Are you sure you want to – go out like that?” “Are you sure you can’t stop staring?” I was glad the long cloak covered me from the rear or he might have had fits. “Sorry. It’s just odd to see you – I mean – for you to wear trousers.” I drew the cloak around myself a little, knowing how bizarre I looked. “Why should it matter? You’ve seen other men in trousers.” “Well, that’s a little different. I mean – they’re men.” He finally shook his head, like a dog shaking himself dry, and tore his eyes away from my legs. He returned his attention to the table, where he had arranged a couple of slim daggers he had sharpened, several bolts, and a rope and hook beside a pair of leather gloves. “I’ve been working on some things here to give you some extra help.” He demonstrated the various tools, including an impressive grappling hook for scaling a wall or a cliff face. Its prongs flicked out when he slid a metal catch open with his thumb. With each new device, I found myself more enchanted by his cleverness. Finally, he held up a crossbow, crowned with something that resembled a long snuff box. “What’s that?” 173 “Chinese repeating crossbow,” he said with pride. “I read about it and figured out how to build one. You load the top slot here –.” He dropped in ten bolts, one at a time. “Then you just keep pulling back on this top lever. Every time you pull back, it fires another bolt.” I almost yanked it from him. Then stared at the priceless treasure in my hands. “Pierre. This is – incredible. Thank you.” He shrugged. “Anything I can do to help. I figure, this way, you can fire again if you miss the first time.” I raised an eyebrow at him. “I won’t miss.” “All right, but – if you need to shoot again, you can fire right away.” I studied the crossbow up and down. It was pure genius. “This is perfect, Pierre. Two shots to make sure I kill it. With enough bolts to shoot down four more before I reload.” “Four – four more?” I squinted at him, wondering why he seemed surprised. “Wolves hunt in packs, Pierre. You know that. There were at least four that attacked Francois.” “Yeah, but I didn’t think – I mean, you can’t hunt them all down at once.” “I can try.” I tugged Pierre’s thick leather gloves on, then gathered my father’s crossbow and a handful of bolts. I slung the strap of Pierre’s repeating crossbow over my shoulder and grabbed tucked a few knives into a sheath, placing them in a leather pouch with the bolts, to hang from Crimson’s saddle. 174 I strode into the brisk evening with Pierre fast on my heels. Crimson turned sharply at the opening door, eager to be off. “Red, you’ll be careful, right? Promise you’ll watch yourself.” “I’ll watch myself.” I hooked the repeating crossbow onto the saddle, along with Papa’s crossbow and the ammunition pouch, then hoisted myself up. “With that red hood, they’ll see you coming a mile away.” I knew he was right. But I refused to live another day in fear. And this hooded cloak was the only thing bolstering my confidence to survive the night. “I want them to see me coming,” I said. He narrowed his eyes. “… What?” My blood surged. Crimson stamped his hooves, perhaps feeling the same fire. “I want to make them afraid, the way they made us afraid. Whatever those things are, I want them to know one of us is fighting back.” Pierre gaped, as if uncertain what to think. “Red, what are you going to do?” I set my jaw like stone. “Something.” I spurred Crimson forth. He snorted and charged ahead. Lightning stabbed at the horizon as Pierre called after me. I saw Father Vestille on his Palomino, trotting toward L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. We met with surprised eyes and I fumbled with the reins, nearly making Crimson stumble before he galloped past. Father Vestille tugged his horse to a halt and struggled to turn about. 175 “Helena! Helena, come back!” he called. I can only imagine how he would react to the bare trousers beneath my flapping cloak. I might be cast out of the church. It no longer mattered. I still had faith, but I had lost all patience. If he put me out of the church for trying to save our province, so be it. The cries of Pierre and Father Vestille echoed behind me, farther and farther away as I galloped through the darkening streets. 176 177 178 MY DISCOVERY 179 180 19. Rain started to drizzle as I arrived at La Maison de Touraine, but it didn’t dampen the wild revelry within its walls. I could see why Mama often referred to taverns as “dens”. The crowd inside rumbled like a pack of growling beasts. I had never set foot in this place except for the banquet to honor Francois, the night he died. But La Maison was a center for local gossip. The perfect starting place to learn what anyone knew about the wolves. Someone must have heard rumors or witnessed recent attacks. 181 An alcoholic stench filled the misty air. I wished for a safer way to seek information. My parents would have preferred that I forget this place altogether. But Francois had told me to seek out his friend if I ever needed help. As we trotted toward the hitching post, two men on the front porch stopped their conversation and stared. At the red horse and its red-cloaked rider. The short man’s mouth hung open. I wondered how much I resembled the Apocalyptic horseman that brought a plague of war. Though I doubted this squat man or his liquor bottle spent much time listening to the Scriptures. “Evening, Monsieur,” he greeted. I said nothing as I swung off Crimson’s flank to plant both boots together on the ground. I had no business with this man and his tone seemed more demanding than friendly. “I said, ‘Evening,’” Squat repeated. He and his slim mustached companion stepped between me and the entrance. “Evening,” I muttered. The mustached man squinted at me. He grabbed at my shoulder and spun me to face him. I looked up in his astonished face. “Why, she’s a girl!” he sputtered. “What sort of game do you think you’re playing, Mademoiselle?” Squat demanded. “This ain’t no place for someone like you.” I swallowed down fear and anger. I had no time for this. “I’ll see for myself and let you know,” I said. 182 I started forward. Moustache moved to block me. Behind me, Crimson grumbled and shifted uneasily, while Squat took another swig of his bottle. “You should listen to your betters, Mademoiselle,” Moustache said. “If you want some drinks, I’ll show you where to find some. More private, away from all these gawkers.” Crimson snorted, ready to charge him. “Step aside, Monsieurs,” I warned. Squat chuckled and glanced at Moustache, who laughed along. “Now, now, Mademoiselle. You didn’t say, ‘please’.” I pulled my crossbow from beneath my cloak and aimed its bolt-end directly beneath Squat’s jowls. They stopped laughing abruptly as my other hand settled on the lever. “Please.” Squat nodded, slow and careful, backing away to let me pass. I lowered the crossbow, measuring their reactions. Satisfied that they would not bother me further, I concealed it beneath my cloak once more. “Would you look after my horse while I’m inside? He sometimes gets agitated around strangers.” Squat and Moustache turned to Crimson, who glared back with eyes that seemed to spit flame. “Yeah,” Moustache said dully. “Sure.” “Why, thank you,” I said. Moustache took a step toward me and Crimson stamped his hoof. Both men spread their arms as they backed up to the wall. Crimson would have no trouble with them. 183 I moved to the oak doors and pushed inside. Into a room of noise and smoke and wild laughter. Where men dressed formally but acted foolishly, and a handful of women moved from table to table, dressed even less modestly than I was, serving drinks and letting men gawk at them from every angle. At the bar counter, separated from the chaos surrounding him, stood a plump man with thinning auburn hair. He talked with two men there as he busied himself polishing a wooden mug. The man I had come to see. The tavern owner, Gerard Touraine. I strode toward the counter, noting the quiet that came in my wake. Like the ripples of a swan wading through a polluted stream. Everyone seemed dumbstruck at the sight of me. Including the men at the counter who watched me approach. For a moment, none of them spoke. “That’s quite a cloak, Monsieur,” said Touraine, wiping the mug in his hand. He turned to put it away and grab a new one from the pegs on the wall. I didn’t know if he had meant that as a compliment. I assumed not. “Thank you.” Touraine stopped and turned on his heel. He took a step toward me and crouched to peer at my mouth beneath the hood. “Eh – are you lost, Mademoiselle?” he asked with a chuckle. Then his face fell. “Wait. You’re that little girl, from Francois’ party. With the, eh –.” His hand rose to make a gesture at his face. He stopped himself before making reference to my 184 scars. I appreciated that. “Francois saved my life,” I said. “He was a good friend of mine.” “Yes,” Touraine said. He cleared his throat. “Mine, too.” One of the other men laughed. “What’s this, Gerard? Your niece paying you a visit? Or is it someone else, eh?” He nudged his friend on the next wooden stool and both men chuckled. Touraine ignored them, focusing on me. “Uh – I’m afraid women aren’t allowed in here, Mademoiselle.” I glanced at the tall brunette leaning over a table of men with her hands on her hips. “She is a woman.” “Of course, but she’s – eh –.” “She has a point, Gerard,” the other man insisted. “That is definitely a woman over there. So it stands to reason, if this mademoiselle insists upon –.” “Enough,” Touraine said, silencing him. “She’s made a mistake. She came to the wrong place, nothing more.” I climbed up onto the stool across from him. I had never sat in such a high chair. But then, I started wearing trousers before today, either. “All I want is a drink.” Touraine shook his head, his brown eyes apologizing. “I couldn’t serve you.” “Oh, come now, Gerard.” The man fished out some coins to toss on the counter. “Here, Mademoiselle. I’ll buy you one.” 185 “Move on,” Touraine ordered the men. “I’ll handle this. Find yourselves a table. We’ll talk later.” The second man held up his hands. “We’re only teasing her, Gerard. Don’t get excited.” Touraine leaned toward them suddenly, almost menacing. “Find a table,” he repeated. The men climbed awkwardly down from their stools and walked away, staring over their shoulders at Touraine as he watched them go. “I only want water,” I said. “Can you serve me that?” Touraine paused to consider, then turned to grab a fresh mug. “I am also curious,” I said as he filled it. “You’re curious?” he asked, amused. “You enter a tavern with that huge cloak and you’re curious. Very well. What are you curious about, Mademoiselle?” “Wolves.” His wrist twitched, then continued to fill the mug. He set it on the counter before me, his head down. He looked up. “Wolves in general?” “Wolves in particular. A large wolf that killed a little girl near here.” “Heard about that. Tragic.” “She was my sister.” Touraine buried his heavy gaze in the floor. “… Very sorry, Mademoiselle.” “I’m curious about that wolf. A lot of people pass through here. Have you heard anything about it?” 186 He narrowed his eyes, looking confused. “Why should I tell you if I did?” “Tell me tonight and you’ll know why tomorrow.” He stepped around the counter. “I think someone should see you home, Mademoiselle.” “I have no home,” I said. The sudden rise in my voice stopped him cold. “The wolves took it from me.” “Well, what about your parents?” My shoulders trembled as I thought of Mama and Papa and Suzette. I stiffened to hide it. “… The wolves took everything.” He swallowed. “I’m so sorry, Mademoiselle. I am. But I don’t see how I can help you.” “You can’t tell me what you know about the wolves that killed my mother and father and little sister? That keep killing off more and more people in the village? I only want to know what they are, what they might be doing.” “Look. I understand you’re hurting. But whatever killed your parents and your sister is dangerous. Probably more dangerous than you can imagine. It’s no business of mine and certainly no business of yours. And I don’t think you want me to hear of another young girl’s death tomorrow. Do you?” “But you have heard things. Haven’t you?” He started to say something. Then chewed on his lip. “I think they’re the same wolves that killed Francois,” I prodded. 187 “Francois was a good man,” he said, his lip protruding in a sideways pout. “A very good man.” “He was too late to save my Grand’Mere from the wolf, but he saved me. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. He was my hero. He still is. He’s the one who sent me to you.” Touraine shot a look at me and narrowed his eyes. “How’s that?” “He said if I ever needed to know anything about anything in the village or beyond, you would be the one to ask.” That was not quite true. Francois had told me to seek Touraine out if I got in real trouble. But this qualified. I needed help and Touraine was the one who could give it. I pressed on. “He also said people need to stand up and do something to help others. Or there would be more killings. More children suffering. He said we can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s right, because some things are worth fighting for.” Touraine lifted his chin. “Francois said that?” I stiffened my jaw. “Yes.” He stared hard at me. Then relaxed. “Yeah, that sounds like something Francois would say. Good man.” “But he’s gone now,” I said, leaning forward on the stool. “He’s dead. A pack of wolves broke into his home and killed him.” Touraine nodded. “I know.” “You also know something about those wolves. I’m a good hunter. If you tell me, I can 188 stop some of them, at least. If you don’t, they’ll keep killing.” He still hesitated, but seemed intrigued. Almost believing me. “Please.” He studied me another moment. Then he resumed his position behind the counter and leaned over it. “If I don’t tell you, I expect you’ll find out from someone else. Won’t you?” I nodded. “All right, Mademoiselle. Don’t ask anyone but me. Understand? You want to know anything, or if something is true, you come straight to me, no one else.” “I will,” I promised. I meant it. This was exactly what I wanted. Touraine glanced from one side of the bar to the other. Then he began to polish a new mug as he spoke in a low murmur. “I don’t know much, Mademoiselle. Some men come in here regularly, and they seem to know something about those wolves. Always eager for news about them, just like you. Always asking for details about recent attacks. It’s odd. They seem delighted by it, like someone’s telling a joke. Lately they’ve been asking about Monsieur Favreau’s farm.” “Monsieur Favreau?” “Pig farmer on the other side of the hill, west end of the forest. Lost four of his fattest pigs to a wolf over the last two weeks. He’s worried he’ll lose the rest, though he’s got plenty to spare, if you ask me.” “When did he lose them?” 189 Touraine rubbed his stubbly chin. “One was two nights ago, the other two nights before that.” He narrowed his eyes and blinked with sudden realization. “Seems it’s been every two nights since it took the first one. Following a pattern.” “Which continues tonight,” I said, finishing the thought that was surely brewing in his mind. I rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle, your drink.” I retrieved the mug. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” I downed the water in one long swallow and returned the mug before heading to the door. “Mademoiselle?” I turned at the door. He looked helpless as a child. “I trust – you have someone to look after you?” “Yes,” I said, stepping out into the storm. “I am.” I let the door thud behind me. 190 20. Favreau’s farm was easy enough to find. I just followed the smell. Even in the rain, the distinctive odor of pig manure spread for a mile. Smoke rose from a thin chimney above the farmer’s spacious cabin, set in a broad clearing surrounded by dense forest. A long narrow pigpen sat beside it, the large pigs kicking up mud and manure as the silvery moon rose above the trees. To the left of the pen sat a small and well-kept stable, large enough to keep two or more horses. 191 Monsieur Favreau would have his eyes and ears pricked for any intruders. He must have noticed the same pattern of attack by now, how the wolf seized one of his pigs every other night. Tonight he could expect to lose another one. I climbed down from the saddle and led Crimson carefully around the perimeter. He moved so cautiously, I don’t think he broke a single twig. Hidden from the cabin windows by the horse stable, I crept toward it, leading Crimson. As we came around the corner, Monsieur Favreau’s black horse started in alarm, stamping and neighing. I quickly found the feedbag, hanging from a hook on the wall, and grabbed a handful of oats. I opened my hand for the horse to see and sniff. He calmed immediately and let me approach so he could nibble from my hand. I shared some with his companion, who had just woken, then grabbed more oats to feed them again. Once they relaxed, I brought Crimson into the stable to stand between their twin stalls. I scanned the clearing. Nothing moved in the dark woods around the farm, though the drizzle made it difficult to be certain. I hoped that any wolves would have equal trouble spotting me. Dim light issued from within the house. Monsieur Favreau must have lit a lantern to keep a late vigil over his property. I grabbed more oats and prepared to lay the pile in my skirt. Then I remembered I was no longer wearing one. I stuffed them in my pants pockets instead, wishing I could store more. I 192 reminded myself that the trousers still gave me the best advantage. I crouched and crept toward the pen. A few pigs squealed upon seeing me approach in my sweeping cloak. I scattered a few oats at them, and they returned to their agitated pacing. Farmer Favreau wasn’t the only one anxious about the wolves tonight. I crawled carefully between the wooden bars of their pen. The pigs backed away and huddled against one another, but they no longer cried out. They gradually spread apart to move freely about the pen once more, though they kept an eye on me, snorting little warnings as they passed by. I crouched in the filthy mud and slop and waited, forcing my senses to adapt to the intolerable smell. At least the rain would wash away some of the manure from my clothes, once I left the pen. But that would be a long time in coming. I would keep vigil until the wolf arrived. I felt the crossbow at my hip. Not my father’s, but Pierre’s Chinese repeating crossbow. As brave as I made myself appear to everyone else, I couldn’t afford to miss or waste time reloading. I sat for over twenty minutes. By then, the pigs seemed to regard me as part of their pen – a piece of scenery to walk around as they continued their nervous pacing. Nearly half of them had fallen asleep. The others seemed as tense as I was. I finally sat in the slop. My knees and thighs were tired, and I no longer cared how I looked or smelled, or what I had to scrub off the 193 cloak later. In any case, this almost guaranteed that the Leóne family would not ask for it back. I leaned against the gate post, turning my head now and then to check for anything approaching from behind the farmhouse. It felt good to finally rest. Nervous as I was, my shoulders and head felt heavy. I closed my eyes and thought of Suzette. Sweet, pure Suzette. Playing among the white daffodils in our meadow, running from me and laughing, her golden hair streaming in the biting wind. I saw her run toward the dark forest. Beyond the first line of trees, the woods were black as coal. Except for the eyes. More than a dozen pairs of eyes, shining from the darkness. “Suzette, stop!” Papa called from behind me. “Come back!” “Suzette, no! Suzette!” Mama screamed. Suzette continued to laugh and run in an irregular pattern, playing a game of escaping me, escaping us all, while the eyes watched from the forest. “Suzette, turn around!” It was Francois Revelier shouting, beckoning her back. Suzette wouldn’t listen. “Helena, go after her!” Papa told me. “Bring her back!” I stood where I was. I watched Suzette, laughing and playing as she drew closer to the forest. “Go, Helena!” Mama urged. “You can get her! Bring her back!” 194 “But the wolves …” I muttered. I felt a tremor through my skin, like a spider crawling up my spine. “You can bring her back, Helena,” Francois said. “You’re the only one who can do it.” Suzette giggled and dodged back and forth, closer and closer to the forest. To the waiting eyes that had grown in number, nearly twenty of them now. “But they’ll kill me, too …” “Helena,” Mama said in a quiet voice. “Helena, please …” “You can do it, Helena,” Papa said. “Bring her back. Bring her back.” A tear flowed down my cheek. “I can’t …” Suzette’s laughter echoed from the forest’s edge. “Can’t catch me!” Then she turned and ran straight into the dark abyss, where teeth flashed open beneath each pair of eyes. “Papa?” I started suddenly. Soft rain fell on my cheeks and I rankled at the damp odor of pig manure. The tiny voice came from the front porch. A little freckled girl stood there in her nightgown, staring out into the dark clearing. I looked and saw a heavyset man standing between puddles, holding a musket. Farmer Favreau, no doubt, watching for the wolves. I had dozed off. Never even noticed him leaving the house. As he surveyed the outer perimeter of trees, I craned my neck, letting the rain needle down on me. Moonlight shone between 195 rolling clouds, directly overhead. I had slept nearly an hour. I looked back at Favreau as his gun whirled in my direction. Its barrel aimed squarely at my hooded forehead. I sat frozen in the mud and darkness. The bearded Favreau stood rigid, squinting through rain at the pigpen. Watching for any movement, listening for any strange sounds. I made none. He finally relented and turned slowly back to the trees, while rain pelted the surrounding leaves. I felt my heart start beating again. “Lucille, go back to bed,” he called over his shoulder, still watching the forest. “I’m not sleepy, Papa,” the girl complained, rubbing her eyes. I estimated her to be four years old. A year younger than Suzette, but just as lively, just as playful. Just as innocent. “Get back inside,” I muttered in a violent whisper. “Into bed,” he repeated. “Your mother wouldn’t have wanted you out in this cold, God rest her soul. Now go on.” I swallowed. He was a widower, raising little Lucille on his own. Just the two of them. “Papa, what’re you doing? Did you hear the wolf?” I felt my breath through my teeth. I alternated between my study of the trees and of the light from Favreau’s house, shining on little Lucille’s white gown. “Get back inside,” I murmured again. 196 “I heard something,” Favreau said over his shoulder. “Might be that wolf, so go on inside, like I told you.” “Yes, Papa,” she said. The rising irritation in his voice finally convinced her. My shoulders relaxed. “Look, Papa! There it is!” Blood flooded my temples as I sat higher. Lucille was right. Striding forth from the forest was a gray wolf – taller and larger than a normal wolf. It grinned, showing no fear of the musket. Perhaps it had never seen one. Or simply didn’t fear it. The rain fell harder as I raised Pierre’s crossbow. If the wolf didn’t fear a bullet, it certainly wouldn’t fear a bolt. Until I sank enough of them into its belly. At least, that’s what I hoped. It padded through the muddy field toward Favreau. As if daring him to shoot. “Get inside, Lucille,” Favreau ordered. “Kill it, Papa. Kill it before it takes another pig!” “Inside, I said!” Favreau couldn’t escort his daughter to safety and face down the wolf at the same time. He leaned his head to one side and sighted the animal patiently. Letting it draw closer into range, he waited for the right shot and pulled the trigger. A beautiful shot, right to its face. It sent the beast spinning backward to the slippery ground, dead. 197 Favreau lifted his head as Lucille jumped up and down on the porch, her fists raised in victory. “You did it, Papa, you did it!” The clearing fell quiet. The creature was dead. It was over. I was never even needed. I felt relieved and strangely cheated. But I couldn’t help but feel grateful over the huge wolf carcass lying still on the soaked grass. Then four more wolves padded into the clearing. They emerged at once, from four different positions, like an organized battalion. Grinning, they marched at Monsieur Favreau like soldiers, each as large as the first one. 198 21. Favreau stood gaping at the gathering wolves, his fingers loosening and tightening on his gun. The wolves moved closer, ignoring their fallen companion as the mounting rain pelted his carcass. “Papa, there’s more of them!” “… get back inside,” he said quietly. He started to back away slowly. The wolves picked up their pace. 199 Favreau continued to back up. He lifted his musket to a firing position, but abandoned the effort as the wolves kept coming, kept grinning. They weren’t rushing at the pigs, or even at Favreau. They focused their attention beyond him, at the porch. At Lucille. My head pounded with terror. They had planned this, waited for this opportunity. They stole a pig every couple of nights to draw the family out into the open, until they found an opportunity to attack Favreau’s daughter. Then they all emerged at once, the same way they must have attacked Francois at his home. Favreau would never get Lucille inside before the beasts devoured them both. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and sliced into the side of a pig. It squealed and ran to the other side of the pen. The wolves jerked toward the commotion as the pigs began to rush back and forth, thumping and sliding against one another. I cut into another one, encouraging their panic. Two wolves sniffed the air, perhaps smelling the flow of animal blood. I rose, my cloak billowing up from my shoulders as I brandished the crossbow. The wolves gaped along with Favreau and his daughter as I rushed between the pigs to the gate. I kicked up at the top bar to flip it open, flinging rainwater. The pigs spilled out of the pen, slipping and stumbling as they darted back and forth across the clearing. 200 The wolves continued to stare as I marched out of the pen and fired at the nearest brown beast, piercing its chest. It fell to the ground hard. The others snarled and charged, struggling for traction. “Get inside,” I ordered Favreau. “Who are you?” “Get inside!” I stepped sideways, angling to face the next wolf as it approached. The others closed in, eyeing me warily. I pulled back twice on the crossbow’s lever, firing one bolt into the first animal’s gut, the other into its paw. My racing pulse had thrown off my aim, but I had wounded it. Enough that it stayed down. I moved in a curving path between the pigs as they skidded across the muddy grass. The remaining wolves circled around me, craning to peer over the herd for a path to get at me. Between the wild flurry of pigs and the misty haze, I couldn’t tell whether there were two or three wolves closing in. They ignored Favreau and his daughter as he scuttled her into the house and shut the door. That was all that mattered. The wolves bared their teeth, dripping with saliva. I registered three of them surrounding me, a gray one to my left, brown to my right, and black behind me. The rain had played tricks on my eyes. What seemed like a perfect hit on the second wolf must have only grazed him. Two of them charged, one from each side. The gray one leaped at me as I whirled to launch a bolt into its stomach. It spun and rolled aside, howling, while I dropped backward to the ground, 201 planting my elbows in the mud. I kicked at a pig as it scurried in front of me, thrusting it at the attacking brown wolf. The startled pig knocked it several feet away, stopping it for a second. Long enough for me to roll to one side and fire a bolt into his companion behind me. Then to fire two more into the brown wolf as it bore down on me, dropping it to the puddle-soaked field. I scrambled to my feet. Three bolts left. The gray wolf rose to its feet, staggering a moment before it turned to lunge. I fired once, keeping my final bolts in reserve. It spun to the ground as the black wolf struggled to all fours and sprang at me. Another bolt finished it as the gray wolf reared back to lunge again. I tugged on the lever, sinking my last bolt into its heart. It fell in a heap and lay still. I stood in the quiet. Chest heaving in the drizzling rain. Waiting for my pulse and heartbeat to slow while the remaining pigs squealed and ran in circles through the clearing. My hands shook. I took deep breaths, ordering my arms and shoulders to relax. I reached into my pouch for another round of bolts and started loading them into the top slot, one by one, in case there were more of them. … More of them … I turned back to the clearing, where the first gray wolf had fallen. The grass there was matted down a little, where the animal had lain. But the wolf was now gone. The rain wasn’t playing tricks on my eyes. Four wolves had come from the forest, but after I 202 struck down the first one, four wolves remained. Only one of the wolves was gray. The first wolf, the one Favreau shot with his musket. It had risen to join the others and attack me again. The wolf nearest to me – the one I shot four times – groaned and rolled to its side. Then it rose and shook its head to recover. I watched, crossbow ready, as it studied its wounded paw, from which a bolt still protruded. Two similar bolts remained embedded in its stomach. It lifted the paw to its teeth, bit hard on the bolt, and tugged, nearly dislodging it. Then the creature set its paw down and reached for the bolt with its other paw. I gaped as it wrapped its claws around the bolt to seize a firm hold – the way a human would – and pulled it out. It dropped the bloody bolt to the ground and regarded me, while I blinked at the impossible feat. Crimson whinnied from his hiding place in the stable. He burst into the clearing, pounding toward me at full gallop. I grabbed onto his saddle as the wolf’s jaws opened to chomp at my legs. Crimson whisked me away and raced into the woods, as I clung to him with one foot in the stirrup. Behind me, three other wolves rose in similar fashion, grinning and showing little signs of the battle. Crimson knew when to run. 203 22. Crimson thundered through the misting rain over twigs and pine needles, as I hung precariously alongside. Pressing hard into the stirrup, I grabbed the saddle’s horn and tugged myself onto his back to settle onto him. I crouched low against his neck as he galloped through the black woods, leaving Favreau’s drenched farm behind. My fingers ached from their grip around the repeating crossbow but I refused to let go of it, despite how little it had helped me. What were these creatures that looked 204 like wolves, but withstood bullets and pulled metal bolts from their paws? Clinging to Crimson, I glanced back at the monsters chasing us. Up ahead, more pairs of red and yellow eyes leered from the darkness. I tugged at the reins and Crimson skidded to a halt, twisting to one side. Three wolves strolled out from behind tree trunks, cutting off our exit while the others closed in from behind. I tugged Crimson to the right. Two more pairs of eyes blazed in the distance. The wolves that owned them padded into the spreading moonlight. I continued circling. Another wolf loped toward us from the opposite direction. We were dead. I swallowed and drew Pierre’s crossbow. If I sank enough bolts into one of them – just one of them – it might bring him down. It was the best I could do. I was about to die, like my family. Like Francois. I would never know love. Never have children. Never see Pierre or Father Vestille or Monsieur Laurent or anyone else again. And no one in the village would know that I had died in a foolish attempt to save them. But I could still honor Suzette, if I could kill one of these monsters. Just one. The wolves blocking our escape stood ready to attack, yet they restrained themselves. I turned about to face the wolves that had chased us from the farm. Their gray leader strode toward me, his three companions following close behind. I choked back a sob. Why did I have to die? A young girl, scarred and helpless and stupid 205 enough to fight these creatures because I knew that someone needed to. Why should I die while these beasts lived to kill again? I had six bolts. It was all that could load before the wolves rose to chase me. I fired the first one. It sank into the gray wolf’s chest, throwing him backward in a tumble. The others waited as it lay on the ground. Then it rolled back to its feet, the bolt protruding from its shoulder. One of his companions padded over to him and yanked the bolt out with its teeth. Then they marched forward. I fired another. I struck him in the same place, close to his shoulder wound, hoping to weaken it. Surely their blood couldn’t flow fast enough to heal the same damaged spot. The wolf rolled backward, grunting against the pain of the blow. Then it rose to its feet again, letting another wolf tear the bolt out. They continued to advance on me as an organized mob. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I fired a third bolt. It gleamed in the moonlight as it flew, striking the wolf in the center of his skull. The animal tipped backward and its eyes rolled in a look of surprise. It spun onto its back and lay on the ground. It did not move. The forest fell quiet. The other wolves gaped at it. Not with anger or fear, but a look of actual shock. They turned toward me and I shuddered. I raised the crossbow with its pitiful three bolts 206 remaining. As I wondered how it would feel to be torn apart and eaten. Instead of attacking, the pack stared at me with wide eyes, as if frightened. Or awestruck. They backed away. I turned Crimson to face the two wolves behind me, expecting them to pounce. But at my sudden turn, they skittered backward. So did the wolves on either side. I turned Crimson again to face them, measuring their reactions. They turned and ran off in all directions, howling and scrambling as if I had set them on fire. The leader’s carcass remained still on the damp ground. Rain dripped like a drum from the tree leaves, as I felt the wild pounding of my heart. Crimson shuffled his hooves in the mud, looking from one side of the dark forest to the other as though he shared my relief and confusion. One bolt – one single bolt – had killed this beast, when every other one failed. What sort of monsters were these? I waited for a few seconds. Resting in the quiet and calm and the cooling breeze from the dissipating rain. I dismounted and touched down carefully on the ground, as though I expected it to swallow me up. But nothing happened. No wolves returned. The gray wolf leader didn’t rise to attack. Its mouth hung open with no breath, no movement. The beast was dead as a fallen log. As any wolf should be after being shot seven times. But why didn’t the first six bolts kill it? Why only the seventh? And why only this wolf? 207 I recalled the wolves from the clearing. This first one entered and was shot by Monsieur Favreau. Four more joined it, and this gray wolf rose up to attack alongside them. But only four of them followed us from the farm. I grabbed hold of the bolt lodged in the wolf’s forehead and pulled. I pressed my boot heel over its open eye and tugged, but it wouldn’t budge. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and cut into the forehead around the bolt, sawing until I made a wide bloody hole. The quieting rain turned the fresh blood even fouler. I swallowed back the bile rising in my throat and spat on the ground. I seized the bolt with both fists, pressed my boot against the animal’s face and yanked hard. The bolt came free all at once. I fell onto my rump holding the shaft, its end covered with blood and bits of bone and flesh. I shut my eyes and quieted my soul a moment. Then I stared at the mess of flesh and fur matted with blood. Underneath it, the bolt looked the same as every other one. What made it so powerful? I stood and shoved it into the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle. He flinched slightly. His stomach seemed stronger than mine, but not much stronger. I mounted and returned to the Favreau farm. I drove Crimson hard, but he needed little encouragement. He seemed just as eager to escape the forest and find shelter before the wolves returned. Favreau’s farm was the last place I wanted to be, but we had to go back. 208 It took little over a minute to reach the clearing. A dim lantern still burned within the house. Favreau might be watching us from inside or rocking his daughter back to sleep, or both. Near the house, a single brown wolf lay still, unmoving. Dead. We trotted up to it and I swung down from the saddle, landing on both feet. I ran to the carcass and rolled it onto its back. Two bolts stuck out from its belly. But blood surrounded only one bolt, in the animal’s stomach. The other bolt yielded no blood, even though it had struck the wolf’s heart. I pressed my boot against its pelt and tugged the bolt free. It pulled far more easily than the one from the gray wolf’s skull. I stared at the bloodstained bolt in the moonlight, turning it back and forth in my fist. I shot and killed this wolf the same way I had killed the gray wolf. Why did these two die when the rest of the wolves survived every attack? Something howled in the distance. Crimson and I whirled toward the forest. I shoved the bolt into the pouch with the other one and hurled myself onto Crimson’s back. We fled, leaving the large wolf carcass for Favreau to clean up in the morning, if he ever chose to leave his house again. I had to find out how Pierre forged these two bolts. And I had to live long enough to do it. 209 23. We charged through the forest, pounding over twigs and pine needles as the rain turned to mist. Back to the village and to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne, the only home I had now. How long it would remain a home, I couldn’t know. But Pierre and his parents had to let me stay at least one more night! Another howl rang through the trees, closer than the first. The wolves had picked up our scent. Crimson thundered ahead without any prodding. My sides ached from the jarring ride, but 210 I refused to restrain him. Not with so much forest to cover. The howling increased, from two or more wolves. They could be organizing themselves, picking out a trail, searching for us. They would find us in minutes. Well before we reached the village. A growing chorus of howls rose as we raced on, sweating in the fresh humidity. They would surround us again, in greater numbers. This time, they would not hold back. “Helena? Helena!” I gasped. Had someone called me? I wished it was possible, this deep into the forest. I tugged on Crimson’s reins for a moment. “Helena! Helena, is that you?” I froze in the saddle. Crimson stamped his hooves, eager to flee. I scanned the area, searching between black trees. A horse approached from the fog, its rider bearing a lantern. The trotting silhouette took on a dark shape, lightening as it drew closer. Beneath the wide-brimmed hat, Father Vestille’s eyes held a look of horror. “Helena! Helena, what’s happened? Are you all right?” I couldn’t answer as he came toward us, appearing from nowhere. I was too exhausted to think. “Helena, what’s wrong? I’ve been searching everywhere for you.” The wolves howled again, less than half a mile away. I jerked at the sound. 211 Father Vestille studied the woods behind us. “You went after them, didn’t you? The wolves.” I said nothing. He turned sharply at another shrill howl. “They’re closing in. Come. My hovel is nearby.” He turned and took Crimson’s reins, leading us away at a fast trot. I said nothing, did nothing to resist. The battle and blood and terror left me numb and aching. I only wanted to sleep. To sleep without dreams or nightmares. We continued through the woods at a steady pace. Father Vestille focused on the muddy path, seeming to ignore the wolves’ terrible howls. We entered the little clearing where his house stood, a sturdy structure of clay and large stones, small but protected. For the first time since my childhood, the sight of Father Vestille’s hovel warmed my heart. A place to lie down and rest, where the wolves could not break in. I was so intent on returning to Monsieur Leóne’s shop that I had never considered retreating to Father Vestille’s home. Of course, I would never have accepted his invitation tonight if I wasn’t so desperate. He led us to his stable behind the cottage and jumped down from his saddle. He looked about, then led his Palomino into its stall, closed the gate and moved to the pile of hay beside it. I sat atop Crimson, heart pounding, chest heaving. The wolves would find this stable any moment. But I waited, my mind and body numb. Waited for Father Vestille to hurry! 212 Even if I hid in the stone house, the wolves would pass by here soon and catch Crimson’s scent. My throat went dry as I imagined them feeding on his flanks while I drifted off to sleep in the warm cottage. We couldn’t stay here. We would have to race on to the village and take our slim chances. Father Vestille set down his lantern and grabbed a pitchfork from the wall. Then he started to rake and pitch hay aside in a mad rush. I froze, exhausted and horrified at his sudden desire to clean. His own fear had driven him mad. He cleared the hay in front of the stalls and set the pitchfork back in place. Two narrow wooden doors, over twelve feet across, had been built into the floor. I blinked. “What is that?” He glanced about once more, then pulled up on the ropes attached to each door handle. Hay and dust fell from them, making my nose twitch. I waved it away and squinted at the wooden ramp extending beneath them. It led deep into the earth below Father Vestille’s hovel. He retrieved his lantern and beckoned us forward. Crimson took a cautious step, then permitted Father Vestille to lead him by his reins down the broad ramp. I expected to duck my head as we descended, but found that even Crimson could stand upright on the ramp and in the long musty room below. A dust-laden cot stood in a cobwebbed corner, opposite some wooden crates of ammunition and gunpowder in the far corner. 213 “The man who sold me this property was a retired soldier,” Father Vestille said in an urgent hush. “He built this underground shelter during the Spanish War, to hide supplies and weapons. I’ve since used it to hide refugees, but not since the War of the Territories.” Near the cot sat a sturdy, long forgotten rocking chair. In addition to soldiers, this place had housed families and mothers with small children. Who had Father Vestille hidden down here? Crimson snorted at something on the far right. I wrinkled my nose at the molded hay strewn across the floor, next to a hitching post built into the wall. This cellar had been designed to hide horses as well as their riders. A true shelter. Sheer genius. “I’ll clean that out of here and get some fresh hay in the morning,” Father Vestille said, setting his lantern on a table. “I’m afraid you’ll have to endure the odor for tonight. Come. Let’s get you cleaned up so you can rest.” I climbed down, but ignored Father Vestille’s offered hand. Instead, I led Crimson to the hitching post, letting Father Vestille hurry back up the ramp to pull both doors shut. He tramped back down as I removed Crimson’s saddle to let him bed down beside the old hay. He gave no argument, showing the same exhaustion I felt. I turned back to Father Vestille. He paled. “Helena, what – what happened? Who did this to you?” He wasn’t staring at the blood or patches of wolf fur or even the manure staining my clothes. 214 Only the trousers that shamelessly exposed my legs to the world. “I did,” I said weakly. “What?” He stared as though I had told him I stuck my hands into a fire. “I can’t explain right now. I just – just want to rest.” He gaped at me for a moment longer, then recovered. “Of course, of course.” He moved to the old cot and lit a candle on the table beside it. “Let me clean this off so you can lie down.” “There’s no need,” I said, dropping backward onto the mattress and sending up a cloud of old dust. I shut my eyes and shielded my nose. I couldn’t get any filthier. “Helena. We should clean you up …” “I just want … to sleep …” The wolves howled from the forest above us, their cries now faint. I opened my eyes to see Father Vestille studying the ceiling. He listened intently for a moment, then turned back to me. “All right, Helena. I’ll be back for you in the morning. Get some rest. And … tomorrow, we can talk. All right?” I didn’t answer or make any promise. I just stared back at him, tired and weak. He nodded, as if we had agreed on something, and stepped away. He left the candle burning for me, to give off a dim light. Finally safe, finally free for a few hours, I shut my eyes and descended into heavy sleep. 215 24. I awoke with a start as something pounded in the darkness. I sat up in bed and blinked, trying to distinguish shapes and remember where I was. Had I returned to Pierre’s loft? My head ached as if something was hammering my skull. The pounding continued from above. I squinted in the hazy light. The candle had burned down to a fuming spark, but dusty rays of light shone through cracks and holes in the ceiling. “Helena, are you awake?” Father Vestille’s voice was muffled. 216 “I’m –,” I started, hearing the harsh rasp of my voice. I cleared my throat and called louder. “I’m awake. You can come down.” One of the long shaft doors creaked open, shedding more light on the tiered ramp. Something surged inside me, a strange sense of hope and freedom that I couldn’t understand. Then Father Vestille’s boots descended the thin boards of the ramp, carrying a tray of food. He wore plain tan trousers and suspenders with a linen shirt. I wrinkled my brow, feeling even more like an intruder. I had rarely seen him without his priestly robe, not since I was a child. He looked tired and worried. “Good morning,” he said. He moved past Crimson, who was rousing himself from the floor, as I sat up in bed. He set the tray on a small table beside the cot. Warm bread and cheese and smoked sausage. The welcome smells nearly overcame the cellar’s musty odor. My stomach rumbled as I closed my dry mouth. Why did I suddenly feel so safe here? Not just in this secret hideaway, but under Father Vestille’s care? He pulled up a stool beside the bed, sliding it past the rocking chair. “Go ahead, Helena. I’m sure you must be famished.” I swallowed. “Thank you.” I started in, seizing the bread with a ferocity that startled me. I didn’t realize how hungry I was. How tired and sore. I felt like a wounded stray puppy Father Vestille had rescued from the forest. 217 He watched me, saying nothing. As though he wanted to make certain I ate. “Do you mind if I join you?” I chewed on one side of my mouth to answer. “Of course. It’s your food.” He smiled. Then he closed his eyes and crossed himself, mouthing a silent prayer. I stopped chewing, feeling ashamed. It never occurred to me to give thanks for the meal, as I normally would. I was too hungry. He lifted his head and opened his eyes. “I’m sorry I didn’t pray.” He shrugged. “The Lord understands. I expect you’ve had quite an ordeal.” I chewed quietly on the bread. He glanced at my legs, covered only by trousers, then looked away, embarrassed. He met my eyes. “Can you tell me what happened?” I kept chewing. He waited for me to swallow. “… It’s more than I can explain.” He frowned, studying my face. “Very well.” He took a piece of bread and sliced off an end of sausage. “I’ll bring down a wash basin for you to bathe, whenever you’re ready. Or you can bathe upstairs and I’ll wait outside.” I sat up at the thought of leaving the dingy cellar to clean up. “If – you don’t mind – yes, I would rather go upstairs.” He gave a curt nod. “I’ll show you where the sponges are. And I’ll start cleaning down here. Or I can wait outside, if you wish, and watch for any uninvited guests.” 218 I lowered my gaze, eyeing the plate of warm food. I never expected him to accommodate me so much after I ran off last night. Especially with the way I now looked. He had no idea what I had done or what monsters were chasing me. Yet he welcomed me into his home without demanding any explanation. “Thank you. But I don’t think they’ll be looking for me now.” “Hopefully not.” His eyes looked kind but wounded. “Are you all right, Helena?” I curled my lips shut. I wanted to tell someone what happened. What I had discovered about the wolves, whatever that was, exactly. I needed to learn what made those two bolts kill the wolves when the others failed. But Father Vestille was the last person I wanted to confess my activities to, let alone boast about them. “I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you for your hospitality. It’s very kind of you.” He seemed ready to say something, then shook his head slightly. “You can stay here if you wish. I’ll keep you hidden. My home will always be open to you, no matter where you go or what you do. I just want you to be safe.” “Thank you. I’ll consider that.” I hardly knew what to say. After I had rejected all of his hospitality, he still offered me a home. His home. Or at least, the secret longhouse hidden beneath it. My own underground refuge, for as long as I wanted. Somehow it seemed right to hide here. Despite its musty odor, it felt so comfortable and 219 familiar. As if I belonged here, where nothing could touch me. I studied the dusty rocking chair as Father Vestille leaned forward on the awkward stool to tear off some bread. “Who did you hide down here during the war?” He blinked in surprise. “I hid you.” I nearly choked on my bread. He leaned forward anxiously, but I held up a hand as I chewed and swallowed. “What?” “You and your parents, and your Grand’Mere. When foreigners started raiding the villages, they were hunting for soldiers. Like your father. This underground shelter was a secret that the former owner shared with me, for just such a purpose. We’ve all kept it secret ever since.” He shook his head, recalling troubled times. “Your father came home frantic, the last survivor of his regiment. Not certain whether to fight the invaders or protect your mother, who was with child – you. He decided, wisely, to protect his family. You were born down here, with your Grand’Mere serving as midwife. You all lived here nearly two years, while the invaders tried to secure territory up above. Your father snuck out at night on several occasions to wreak havoc on their equipment and supplies, then retreated back here to safety.” “Papa hid here and snuck out to battle the enemy at night?” “One successful ambush after another,” Father Vestille said. “He took great risks, but he always returned home safe to your mother, here.” Just like I did last night, I thought. 220 I stared back at the rocking chair, laden with years of dust. I tried to imagine Mama rocking an infant in it. Tried to imagine her wondering how long she would be confined to this underground prison, struggling to keep her child hidden. To keep me hidden. As she wondered if the invasion would ever end, and whether Papa would return that night, or leave her and Grand’Mere to raise me all alone. Father Vestille folded his hands over his mouth. “The invading forces never bothered me. I was only a priest, submitting to their rule. So I could keep you all safe.” He lowered his gaze. “That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. Your parents invited me here from Burgundy, and let me stay with them until I could find a place of my own. This place. I owe them a great deal.” I felt cobwebs lifting from my memories. “I remember a wide door opening in the ceiling,” I said. “I remember sunlight pouring in.” He smiled. “We all celebrated when the King’s soldiers arrived to secure order. We were free. Free to return to our separate homes. But we kept meeting every week at your home.” Until the wolf attacks, when you decided to spend your time visiting safer provinces, I thought. Still, it was clear my family owed him a great debt. I owed him a great debt. “I never knew that,” I said. He ate his bread and sausage while I broke off a chunk of cheese. We chewed in silence. When we finally finished, he gathered up the tray and moved to a far corner of the room, where a 221 ladder stood upright near the wall. It ended at the dusty ceiling. “Let me show you where the basin and sponges are. Then I’ll get some oats for your horse and start tidying up down here.” He moved the tray to one arm and started up the ladder. I stood, amazed. “This leads up to your home?” “Of course,” he said. He pounded with one fist against the ceiling and pushed open a door. Light poured in from above. I felt the same rush of memories from childhood, feelings of instant safety and freedom. Father Vestille slid the tray up onto the floor above, then brushed away clumps of dust from the opening. “It was designed well, to hide soldiers and refugees as well as weapons. If anyone attacked, there was another means of escape. However, I figured it would be best to enter through the ramp we used last night. I didn’t want to startle you. You can eat meals with me or down here. Or you can stay somewhere else and come here if you need refuge. Whatever you choose.” He ascended the ladder and stepped out of sight. I hesitated to follow him. He had invited me into his home many times, but I had never looked or smelled so foul. With my strange and wanton appearance, I expected him to deny he even knew me. I rose from the cot, feeling stiff pain throughout my body, especially my ankles and lower back. I didn’t realize how much last night’s ordeal took out of me until I tried to simply stand 222 up. Crimson went back to sleep on the floor. He must have felt the same exhaustion, or perhaps more. I climbed the ladder, stepping gingerly on bruises and blisters that stung the soles of my feet. I clutched the rung and grit my teeth. If I planned to continue this crusade, my body would have to adapt. The door in the ceiling opened onto a corner of Father Vestille’s front room, warm and free of dust. I breathed in clean air and felt my body relax. He had few furnishings, but they looked comfortable. Three cushioned chairs, a breakfast table, a reading table with a lantern and his Bible beside another leatherbound book, a broad round rug, some portraits of the Christ and of some friends, and a stoop leading up to the front door. The outer porch was all I had ever seen of this place. Who could imagine it hid such a refreshing home? I looked back at the wall of portraits, seeing one that looked familiar. I stepped forward and saw that it was my parents, with me as a child, only a few years old. Mama held me on her lap, unable to contain her smile. Papa sat beside her, strong and upright, lifting his stiff chin as if daring anyone to attack his family. I forced down emotions, refusing to let myself cry. Then I realized, he had no paintings of any other friends. He kept this portrait alone, alongside the portrait of the Christ. A picture of Mama and Papa and me from long ago, before I was scarred. I tightened my lips and stood taller. 223 Father Vestille noticed me staring at the portrait. “You were only four then,” he said. “That was painted by a young man who came through the village, a couple of years after the war. Your father paid to have it made and it was remarkable. He could tell I wanted it badly, but I would never ask. I still feel it should have been hanging in your home all these years, but he insisted I keep it. He told me they would see it often enough, every time they came over.” I felt a lump of shame in my throat. I had never even seen it. I turned back to the reading table, picking up the leatherbound book. “Is this a book of Latin translation or something?” He deftly extracted it from my hands, so suddenly and gracefully it felt like it had vanished into thin air. “No, this is nothing,” he said, sliding it beneath his Bible. “Just an old journal of personal notes.” I swallowed. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to be so nosy. I’ve just – I’ve never been here before.” “It’s all right, Helena. You have nothing to apologize for.” He pointed at a large oval washtub against the wall. A bucket was set beside it with a rag slung over its rim. “The washbasin is here. I’ll fetch some water to heat up and fill it for you. Should have it ready in less than an hour.” He pointed at the rear door. “My room is in the back, if you need more rest while you’re waiting.” “Father Vestille. My clothes are filthy. I can’t lie down on your bed.” 224 He didn’t look at me as he grabbed a bucket from the corner. “I can wash the bedsheets later. Right now, I’m caring for you.” “Don’t you need to know what happened? Where I went after the funeral?” He started toward the front door. “I’m sure you’ll tell me when you’re ready, if you wish to.” “Why did you ask if I went after the wolves last night?” “I heard them howling. Obviously, they were chasing you.” “But why did you hide me underground? You don’t mind me being here now. Why didn’t you take us straight into the house last night?” He stopped with the door half-open. Standing like a statue, he stared at the stoop in silence. Then he slowly closed the door and stepped down, setting the bucket on the floor. “Helena, sit down.” “I told you, I’m filthy. I can’t sit on these nice –.” “Helena, please,” he implored in a mournful tone. “I need to speak with you.” He sat in one cushioned chair. I sat in the one opposite him, struggling to ignore the mud and manure of my cloak staining its cushion. Father Vestille folded his hands and stared at the floorboards. “I hid you underground because – I thought others might be chasing you. Along with the wolves.” 225 I stared at his balding head. Wondering what secrets he held inside it. “You know something about these attacks.” He looked up, his eyes desperate and sad. “Helena. I don’t know what happened to you as a child. I don’t know what killed your parents and Suzette.” “Father Vestille, I think I –.” “— but I have my suspicions.” Blood surged through my cheeks like fire. “I’ve heard many rumors over the years. Of attacks on women and children in this area and other provinces. In Gevaudan and Dijon and several villages throughout France. Attacks by wolves.” My breath grew heavier. My heart beat harder. “And not ordinary wolves. Witnesses describe them as something larger than a wolf, but similar in appearance. The largest wolves are about five feet long, but these are more than six feet long, standing over four feet high.” I stifled an inward gasp. He was describing the size of the wolves I had fought last night. The size of the wolf that scarred me when I was seven. “People also claim that these wolves act strangely. Almost cunning in their approach, the way they avoid men and their weapons. Almost stealthy in their patience and strategy, attacking victims when they’re alone and most vulnerable. Some insist they have noticed these wolves waiting several nights for an opportunity to seize a 226 small child, the moment she ventured outside her home.” In my mind, I pictured Favreau’s farmhouse and the thinning ivory nightgown of his young daughter. I felt a shiver in my skin. “What are these creatures?” Father Vestille shook his head, looking helpless. “I have no idea. But there have been rumors of other activity in those same areas. Some people claim there is a cult that worships wolves, believing the animals to be superior to men in both power and cunning. This cult calls itself the Lycanthru.” He held my locked gaze. “Many believe the Lycanthru are responsible for these attacks.” I could hear my breath now. Feel my chest heaving up and down. “How?” He shook his head again. “I don’t know. Some say they capture wolves and practice witchcraft on them. They believe the Lycanthru have the power to transform these wolves into the creatures that attacked those women and children.” Every nerve of my body was on fire. “How do I find them?” “You don’t!” he barked. He struggled to calm himself, shaking. “Helena. I’m telling you this to help you understand. These men are practicing witches. They’re performing rituals on wolves to make them kill people.” I stifled my fear. “Like Mama and Papa? And Suzette and Francois?” He frowned. “Yes. And like you, if you keep after them. Do you understand?” 227 I stood to my feet. “Someone has to stop them, whatever they’re doing. Someone has to make this stop.” He rose with me. “But you are not that person, Helena.” “You don’t think I can face them? You’re wrong. You would know how wrong you were if you saw me last night. I killed two of them.” “Two of how many? There have been over a hundred attacks reported, just in the surrounding villages. Do you expect to hunt them all down?” He stopped himself. Then he took me by the shoulders. “Helena. I know you’ve suffered. I’ve suffered, too, though not as greatly. I lost your father and mother and your sweet sister. I don’t want to lose you, too.” I felt my cheek twitch, but I steadied my resolve. “I’ll see to it that you don’t.” “It’s not that simple, Helena.” He turned from me, wringing his hands. “What happens when they come after you? Were they chasing you when I found you?” I said nothing, but shuddered. “You’re dealing with something far more dangerous than you realize.” I bit my lip. “Maybe I am. But someone has to.” He hung his head, defeated. “I cannot tell you what to do. I can only beg you to stay away from those people. These attacks have been occurring for decades, and no one has yet found a way to stop them.” 228 I thought of the two crossbow bolts in my satchel bag, my senses on fire. “I might have found it.” He blinked and narrowed his eyes at me. “How, Helena?” “I’ll look into it further and let you know.” I knew better than to tell him anything more. He already had little faith in my abilities. What would he think of my report that two bolts had killed wolves when all of the other bolts failed, and I just needed to figure out why. “All right, Helena.” His eyebrows lifted in a shrug of surrender. He stood as if shouldering a heavy weight. “Please consider what I said. And don’t do anything foolish.” His warning had come far too late, but I said nothing. “Rest in my bed for a while. I’ll fetch water and heat the bath. You can make this your home, if you wish.” He frowned again. “You are – You’re the only one left of your family. I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Please stay safe.” I swallowed. “I will. I promise.” He nodded, pursing his lips. As though he accepted my vow but knew I wouldn’t give up my dangerous plans. He retrieved the bucket and moved to the front door, creaking it open to scan for intruders before stepping outside. I felt a strange emptiness in the silent house. Father Vestille was the last person I wanted in my life, especially now. But he might understand my loss better than anyone else. In an 229 odd way, he was the closest thing to a family I had left. I sighed, dismissing my grief. His hovel kept me warm and secure. That was all that mattered. If this Lycanthru cult was behind the attacks, they would never search for me in a priest’s home, let alone his secret underground retreat. I could no longer sleep in the loft at L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Not after attacking the wolves last night. Some villagers might expect me to seek help from Pierre, and that expectation could endanger him and his parents. I would have to avoid meeting him too often. After I returned there today, of course. 230 25. By late afternoon, I had bathed and eaten a little more. I even slept another few hours in Father Vestille’s underground retreat, which smelled much nicer once he finished his cleaning. After I woke, I cleaned and fed Crimson, who seemed to feel as fresh and alive as I did, eager to gallop again. As we pounded toward the blacksmith shop, a few villagers cast odd glances at my bright hood and burnt umber horse. They would surely 231 have gaped at my offending trousers as well, if they knew I was a girl. The odor of burning iron filled the inside of L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Pierre looked up from his smelting pot and quickly extinguished the flame, setting his tools aside. He met me with eyes full of panic. “Red! Where did you go? Where have you been all day? Father Vestille was searching for you for hours, and I’ve been –.” “He found me,” I said. “I’m –.” I stopped short, catching myself before I announced I was staying with Father Vestille. Pierre was the one person I could confide in. But to protect him and myself, I had to keep that retreat secret. From everyone. “What?” “I’m not sure where I’ll be staying now.” He looked wounded. “Red. You can stay here as long as you want.” “That’s not entirely safe. I appreciate the offer, and I may take advantage of it now and then. But your loft can’t be a permanent home. It will draw too much attention.” “From who? I don’t care what anyone in town thinks.” “Not from people in town.” “Red, what’s happened?” “I found them.” Color drained from his cheeks. “The wolves?” “And I fought them. About twelve of them.” 232 He glared at me, trembling slightly. He looked me up and down, apparently checking for cuts or missing limbs. “Are you – Are you all right? You – You got through it.” “Yes,” I said, sounding more annoyed than I should have. Pierre knew I was a better hunter than most men. But no one, man or woman, would likely survive an attack from a dozen wolves. If it weren’t for Father Vestille, I would be dead. I softened, touching his hand. “I’m fine, Pierre. Thank you for your concern, and your help. Everything you gave me.” He released an anxious sigh. “How did the blades work for you?” “Fine, Pierre,” I said. “They work just fine.” “And the new crossbow?” I lifted the repeating crossbow for him to see. “It worked perfectly. Twice. That’s why I need your help.” He took the crossbow and studied it with a quizzical expression. “It only fired twice?” “No. It fired thirteen bolts.” He blinked at me, looking even more amazed. “You missed?” Heat rose in my cheeks and I stuck my fists on my hips. “I sank every single bolt into those things.” “Oh,” he said, satisfied with the answer to one puzzle but still confounded by the remaining one. I calmed myself and realized he was complimenting me. He believed his own repeating 233 crossbow was more likely to fail than I was likely to miss. “Most of my shots would have killed a normal wolf. But these things kept coming. The bolts had no effect on them. Except for these two.” I held up the grimy bolts I had pulled from my satchel. He took them from me and squinted closely. “What’s so special about these two?” “That’s what I need you to find out. Do you make every bolt the same way?” “Yes,” he said. Then he seemed to recall something and looked a bit ashamed. “Although – the process is the same, but – we don’t always use the same material. You asked me to make you extra bolts, so I used the metal we had in supply. I had to mix in some other metal for some of them, to give you a few more.” “How many bolts did you make that way?” “Only two or three.” We gaped at one another. Tugging on his work gloves, Pierre grabbed a rag and dunked it into a steaming pot of water. He squeezed it out, then used it to wipe most of the blood and grime from each bolt. He took them to a smelting pot at the opposite end of his work table, adding some kindling to heat a flame beneath it. Then he held the bolts over it, melting them slowly. After a full minute, I watched a single drip fall into the pot. I stepped aside to sit on a bench. This would take some time. Beyond the furnace, the rear door of Pierre’s house opened. Monsieur Leóne came out, marching straight across the room. “Pierre, I need 234 you to finish those stokers for Monsieur Denue by Friday.” Pierre turned on his heel to stand at attention. “Yes, sir.” Monsieur Leóne studied his son a moment, then noticed me sitting quietly in the corner. “Helena? What are you –?” He blinked hard at my legs. I broke the silence. “I came to ask Pierre for some help. Something’s wrong with my bolts.” He seemed to be struggling for words. I crossed my legs and tried to pull the outer edges of my cloak over them. It didn’t help. He seemed just as perplexed, just as offended. “Helena …” He started to speak, wrinkled his brows some more, and shut his mouth. He tried again. “Helena, I – I’m so sorry for your loss. Your mother and Suzette, they were wonderful people.” I stared back, feeling numb. “Thank you.” He couldn’t tear his eyes away from my masculine garb. “Do you – need anything? Food or – clothes?” “No, thank you. I’m well taken care of.” He forced his mouth to close. Then at last, he turned and walked away, but stopped to address his son. “Pierre, I need to pick up some more iron. The miners finally broke through and found a rich supply, so we won’t run short again. I’ll return in two hours.” He glanced sideways at me, then turned back to Pierre. “Can you handle everything while I’m away?” “Of course, Papa.” 235 Monsieur Leóne gave a curt nod, blinked at me twice more, then left through the door to their home. Pierre looked irritated. “First time he’s ever asked me if I can handle the shop by myself. I usually do when he’s away.” “I don’t think he approves of my wardrobe,” I said flatly. Pierre shrugged. “Well – it’s a little different.” I looked away, feeling even more isolated. But I no longer cared what Monsieur Leóne thought of me. Or what anyone else thought. Pierre studied the falling drips of metal. “Nothing unusual so far. Regular iron, like we always use. Some lead, though, showing here. All right, so this one had some other metal mixed in. But I can’t see how that would matter, when – wait – all right, some copper. Traces of silver …” Blood surged through my shoulders. As though I was meant to pay attention to that detail. As though I had been given the answer. Silver. Francois said his ax blade was made of silver. His blade only grazed the wolf, but had killed it instantly. “Try the other one,” I said. He narrowed his eyes at me, confused. “I haven’t finished studying this one.” “It’s enough. Melt the other one.” He frowned, but set his tools and the first bolt aside. Within a few minutes, he found what I expected him to find. 236 “– some lead in this one, too – Some traces of silver. Must have just poured everything in at once. Nothing else yet, but –.” “It’s silver,” I said. “What?” “Silver. That’s what kills them.” “Red, that makes no sense. A silver bolt couldn’t hurt a wolf any more than an ordinary bolt.” “You should tell them that.” “But how’s that possible?” “I don’t know. But these bolts killed them, and so did Francois Revelier’s silver ax. Killed it easily, just like the two I shot last night. That must be the difference.” “Red, silver isn’t any kind of poison.” “It might be to them.” He shrugged again. “All right. How can we know for sure?” I sat rigid on the bench and stiffened my lip. “Only one way. I’ll have to start using silver bolts.” “You’re going after them again?” “Yes. But this time, I’ll be better armed.” “Red, if you’re wrong, they’ll kill you!” “They’ll kill us all, anyway,” I said hotly. “That’s what no one seems willing to grasp. They’re not going to stop. They’ll keep coming. They’ll keep getting stronger and more numerous and killing everyone they feel like killing. We can die trying to stop them or sit at home and wait for them to come. I’m not waiting.” “But – silver? That’s impossible, Red.” 237 “So are these wolves, over six feet long and able to …” He waited for me to finish. “Able to what?” I almost said they could talk and stand upright. Something I never shared with anyone outside my family, not even Pierre. At least, not after the week of the attack, after seeing the confused faces of Father Vestille and Francois when I told them what happened. I couldn’t bear to receive that same look from Pierre. “… able to organize themselves to attack in large numbers,” I finished. “They staked out that pig farmer’s house to get at his daughter.” “What makes you think that?” “There were plenty of wolves on hand last night to attack. Yet for the last two weeks, they only took one pig at a time. They didn’t care about the pigs. They only wanted to draw out the farmer and his little girl. Once she came outside, the wolves showed up in full force.” “But why would wolves attack a little girl when they could go after a whole herd of pigs?” I thought of Father Vestille’s story about the Lycanthru, practicing witchcraft on wolves. “They’re not wolves. They’re some other sort of creatures, under some kind of spell. I’ll need silver bolts. My blades and other weapons need to be silver, too. Even my grappling hook, just in case.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “We don’t have that much silver to spare, Red. How much does it take?” 238 I peered into the smelting pot at the sparse drops of melted silver. “How much was in those bolts?” “Barely a trace.” “Then that’s all I need. Just a little on the tip of each bolt and the sharp edges of each blade.” Pierre rubbed the back of his neck. “Red, suppose you’re right. Suppose this will kill them. They’re not likely to show up at that farm again. How will you even find them?” I thought of Touraine, telling me about the men who delighted in reports of wolf attacks. Men who might belong to the Lycanthru. “I have an idea where to start.” 239 26. A few hours later, after I ate some bread and pork prepared by Pierre and rested a little more in his loft, I rode toward La Maison de Touraine. Pierre had outfitted all of my weapons while I slept, gilding each new bolt and knife edge with silver. He said his father would be furious to learn he had melted down other customers’ works to make new bolts for me, putting their orders further behind. But he planned to tell him he found some imperfections and needed extra time to finish. I thanked him for it. 240 It was near nightfall. Villagers started to tug their cloaks about their shoulders as they passed by in the street. Many of them stared at me with a fresh sense of surprise. Instead of wrinkling their noses at me, they stopped in their tracks and followed my movements, almost in a sense of wonder. As though it had suddenly become admirable to wear a giant red cloak. I rode up to the hitching post at La Maison and left Crimson to stand beside it. I patted his neck. He had slept well at Father Vestille’s last night and gotten more water and oats from Pierre. He seemed fit and ready for whatever might come tonight. I pushed through the thick doors of the tavern. Raucous conversations stopped. I scanned the room. Every eye fell on me. I stood at the door, uncertain what to do. Were they staring at my scars? At the red hood? I stepped forward, listening to my own slow boot steps on the floorboards as I approached the bar counter. People began to murmur and resume their excited conversations, now strangely hushed. Were they talking about me? At the bar, Touraine wiped the counter where a man had just spilled his beer. As I drew near, the gaping man slid off his stool, filling my face with his alcohol breath. He continued to stare as he turned in a circle and backed away, forgetting the rest of his drink on the counter. “So,” Touraine said quietly. “You’ve returned.” 241 “I seem to be popular this evening.” His broad shoulders heaved and sighed. “Yes, you are. You went to Favreau’s farm last night.” It was not a question. “I might have.” “You fought five or six large wolves there, killed two of them. They found the bodies this morning.” “There were about a dozen, actually. They chased me into the –.” “You’re him, aren’t you?” interrupted a well-dressed man. His large elbow came to rest on the far end of the counter. His voice was smooth, almost mocking. “You’re that red rider. The one who fought all the wolves at that farmhouse.” I turned slowly toward him, keeping my head down, saying nothing. It seemed prudent to let him think I was a man. Even more prudent when I took a good look at him out of the corner of my eye. Tall and strong, with a broad black moustache. He held his drink at his side, grinning as if he was somehow challenging me. Not doubting me, but wanting to test my abilities. “Move along, Brocard,” Touraine said. “Those are just rumors. How could one man take on a pack of wolves by himself?” The man ignored Touraine and didn’t budge. He sipped his drink, studying me. “Those wolves. They’re dangerous, you know. You’re lucky to be alive.” His face lit up like the devil, or something worse. As if he could picture the wolves tearing me apart. “I’m Jean Paul Brocard. I farm 242 cattle and do some business in the village. I trade livestock, horses, weapons, tools. Anything a man might need.” He raised his eyebrows with an unconvincing show of friendliness. “Perhaps I could outfit you some day, Monsieur. A man who fights off a whole pack of wolves will surely need help now and again. Extra food for your horse. Extra bolts for that crossbow.” Touraine cleared his throat, looking nervous. “I really don’t think the man’s interested, Brocard.” The smiling man edged closer along the bar counter. “You might discover I’m a good man to have on your side, Monsieur. You need someone you can count on, to help you survive. When the odds are overwhelming.” He slid his drink along ahead of him, stopping it near me. He sat on the stool beside mine and leaned forward, folding his fists as he tried to look beneath my hood. “Because those wolves will come looking for you, you know. All of them. And they’ll find you. And tear you into small pieces. Who will help you then?” I stood and raised my crossbow to his face. Every conversation halted again as Brocard lifted his chin. His Adam’s apple swallowed hard. Then he smiled wider, as if to cover his anxiety. I understood, since I had drawn my crossbow in order to keep him from seeing my shoulders trembling. I focused on steadying the weapon, the way Papa had taught me to do when we were hunting, to push aside my fear. Brocard lifted his palms in gracious surrender. I allowed him to take a step back. “I see 243 it is a ‘No’ for now,” he said. “We’ll talk again another time, Monsieur.” He continued to back away, hands raised as he grinned. I turned toward the watching crowd. They all kept silent. A few of them turned away as I met their gaze. “Yes, you’re popular all right,” Touraine said. “Be glad I’m not telling anyone you’re a girl. A strange young girl at that, dressing like a man and fighting wolves in the dead of night. They’d never leave you alone.” I lowered my crossbow, concealing it beneath my cloak. “Am I really that strange?” He pursed his lips. “Have you seen a mirror lately?” “But you meet all sorts of people here. Even women. Am I actually the strangest girl you’ve ever met?” He considered for a moment. “Ever?” I nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, you are. Just watch yourself. Men like Brocard are charming enough, but he’s part of a dangerous crowd.” I resumed my place on the stool. “Dangerous, how?” “Excuse me, Monsieur.” I flinched at the gruff voice. A tall man marched straight at me. He wore the broad blue cloak of the village police. “I hear you were involved in an incident at Monsieur Favreau’s farm last night.” I kept my head down a little, hiding beneath the hood as best I could while I studied him. He looked strong and severe, with inky black 244 hair beneath his broad-brimmed hat. He squinted at me with narrow eyes. Eyes that shone blue-gray.",

      "content": "“Yes, I will,” he repeated, and was gone. I waited to hear him descend the last step of the wooden ladder before I lowered my hands. I resumed dressing in his mother’s satin gown. It was the only suitable outfit that wasn’t tattered with age. A full-length mirror stood beside the wardrobe. The dress would work, though it seemed more suited for a ball than a funeral. I donned her red cloak and tied it about my neck. “Let me know when you’re ready, all right, Red?” Pierre called from below. I stared at my reflection. At the red cloak around my head and shoulders. The bright color I had been forbidden to wear for nine years. Ever since the wolves began to rule my life and the lives of everyone around me. Wearing this cloak gave me a surge of energy inside, a sense of strength I had never known, even when hunting. 160 “Yes, Pierre,” I called back. “I’m ready now.” “Here she is,” Pierre said, waving a hand toward Madame Leóne as he gently guided me toward her with his hand on my back. Madame Leóne bent forward in her elegant homemade gown, spun of midnight blue silk with an embroidered bodice. The exquisite sort of dress Mama might have made for me, if I were wearing it for someone else’s funeral. She clutched me to herself as we stood outside la Chapelle de Saint Matthieu. “I’m so sorry, dear,” she said, cradling me. I remained rigid, ashamed that I could not return her tender hug. All of my emotions had been burned to ashes, leaving me empty. I kept still and silent as a harsh wind began to whip at our skirts, warning of the approaching storm. She finally broke off the embrace, as cautiously as she had started it, and offered a weak smile. She struggled to clear her throat. “That’s – such a beautiful cloak, Helena. Your mother would have loved to see you in it.” Monsieur Leóne emerged, holding open the door for us. “He’s about to start, Lisette,” he said in a subdued tone. “We should – .” He gaped at me. At my bright red cloak. “… Brianna …” he muttered. Madame Leóne turned sharply to him. “Oh, dear. Is that – ?” She glanced back at me, her eyes 161 wide. “I had no idea. But – it’s so beautiful, isn’t it, Frayne?” Monsieur Leóne continued to stare at me, not moving. “No one’s really – using it, Papa,” Pierre broke in slowly. “And Helena’s old enough to wear it. I just thought – .” Monsieur Leóne held up a hand, stopping him. “It’s fine,” he said. “Yes, she – she looks lovely. So sorry it’s – being worn for such a sad occasion.” He swallowed. “You’re welcome to the cloak, Helena. I believe – perhaps it’s right for you to have it.” He turned aside, staring at the dirt. Then regained his composure. “Come along. It’s – time to get things started.” “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust …” I sat quiet and still in the pew beside Pierre inside the church, watching Father Vestille prepare to give the eulogy and pray over the bodies of Mama and Suzette. Incense filled the air, within the dim candlelight that cast dismal shadows on the stone walls and stained glass windows. The caskets were closed. Nearly thirty people had assembled to pay honor to my family’s memory. As always, Duke Laurent’s presence in the second row gave the service added a significant prestige. His advisor, Monsieur Simonet, sat beside him, his usual frown now seeming appropriate. Father Vestille hung his head, slow to begin. Finally, he lifted his eyes, grimaced, and 162 spoke in a hoarse voice. “My friends …” He cleared his throat and started again. “My friends. Thank you for coming. We are here to lay to rest – the bodies of Celeste Basque and – her youngest daughter, Suzette Basque. Both brutally attacked by beasts earlier this morning.” He paused, closing his eyes. Gathering his breath. “Our hearts cannot be heavier. My heart cannot be heavier. To lose such a wonderful woman and her innocent child. The Basque family has been like my own family. They welcomed me into this community and into their home. Their kindness, their openness and hospitality, inspired me to be more open to others. To find ways to reach out and welcome neighbors and strangers, the way they welcomed me.” Father Vestille observed the silent coffins. He looked so sad, so defeated, as if he might struggle to lift his head. His voice choked. “Celeste and Suzette Basque have become – even closer to me these last few months, since – since Henri Basque died. He was also – He was also cruelly taken by a wolf. Their eldest daughter, Helena, is still with us. And I urge all of you to do whatever you can, anything you can, to show her support and comfort in this time of great loss. It’s more than anyone, especially a young girl like Helena, should be forced to bear.” I felt the eyes of others staring at me. Even Pierre glanced at me. To see my reaction. I ignored all of them, staring back at Father Vestille in stony silence. Memorizing each hollow word. 163 He stood a little taller, finding more of his voice. “But we must encourage ourselves, not only in the face of death, but in life. In all that we face, even in the midst of the most horrible tragedy, we must seek the face of the Lord and draw strength from him to continue with every task of daily life. With every disappointment, every grief, every threat –.” I rose from my seat. Father Vestille stopped. Covering the cream dress, I still wore the red cloak, which had drawn several curious stares when we entered the church. But no one dared criticize what I had chosen to wear for the burial of my remaining family. And no one would interfere with me now as I stepped toward the caskets. I stopped in front of the smaller one and stared down at it. I turned to Father Vestille. “Open it.” His skin paled like a phantom. “Helena. I – I know how horrible this is for you, but –.” “Open it.” He stood frozen behind the pulpit, with no idea how to respond. The rest of the crowd kept silent in their seats. I walked behind the wooden coffin. Peeling my hood back, I lifted the lid. Inside, a few pieces of Suzette’s body had been carefully laid. Each one stripped clean of the majority of decaying flesh and dried blood. I marveled at how quickly Father Vestille had gathered and prepared them. Each piece had been neatly arranged, the hand and partial skull and 164 ribcage exactly where they should be. Except that the lower part of the ribcage was a pile of fractured sticks. This was not my sister. Only her bones. My sister’s soul had ascended and I would not see her again until my own death. All that remained of her was this pile of lifeless flesh, which would never smile again, never run again, never laugh again. I faced the spectators. Neighbors, cousins, and friends I had not seen for months. I couldn’t even remember some of their names. Pierre and his parents, Duke Laurent and even Simonet, stared at me in shock, almost fear. I lifted Suzette’s skeletal hand up high, to show everyone it was no longer connected to her tiny wrist. Women squealed and nestled against their husbands, while mothers shielded their children’s eyes. I no longer cared. I met their stares, glaring back at them. I held the hand higher. “This … will end.” I laid the hand gently back in its place with the rest of my sister’s useless parts. Then I slammed the coffin lid down, letting it echo through the sanctuary. I secured my hood once more and marched past the stunned crowd toward the rear oak doors. Ignoring Father Vestille as he gaped from the front. Past Duke Laurent, Papa’s old friend, who seemed ready to stand and comfort or dissuade me, but wisely held his place. Past Pierre, wrinkling his brow with worry, as his parents looked on with stunned faces. 165 I pushed the double doors open and strode to Crimson, who snorted eagerly beside Pierre’s horse. I climbed onto his back and he lifted his hooves, as if sensing my urgency. We galloped off into the darkening afternoon as a storm threatened on the horizon. 166 18. I rode back to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne and found the spare key beneath the stone near the front stoop, where I knew Monsieur Leóne kept it. I unlocked the shop’s front door and went inside, wondering if I might ruin the late Madame Leóne’s satin gown just by walking through the warm oily air. I didn’t climb up to the loft to rest or gather my thoughts. Instead, I lit a few candles and started rummaging through the shop. I had decided on my 167 next course of action. I just needed to work out the details. I was still gathering bolts and knives when I heard fast hooves approaching. I continued working as I recognized Diamond’s whinny from out front before Pierre burst through the door. “Red! Red, what are you doing?” “Preparing for a hunt.” I continued to pace the tables and shelves, selecting weapons. “I need your help, Pierre. I need a pair of boots.” “Boots?” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “What for? If you need slippers or sandals –.” “No. I’m going hunting and I need boots to get through the mud.” He remained confused. “I know you can hunt, but … boots? I mean –.” He shook his head, as if unable to speak. “What?” “Well – You’re a girl.” We stared at one another in silence. “I am aware of that. I need the boots, nevertheless.” “We don’t even sell boots.” “I know.” I bit my lip. “I was hoping you might have an extra pair I can borrow.” “Yeah. I guess. I have some old boots I meant to pass on to someone. They might fit you, if you really need them.” “Thank you.” He remained confused. “Still seems awfully odd for a girl.” I took another deep breath. “I also need a pair of trousers.” 168 He stared blankly at me. “I realize I’m still a girl,” I said. He studied the cold stone floor. “You’re going after those wolves, aren’t you?” I said nothing. The wind outside gave a shrill whistle. “Red, those things could kill you. We can get some men together and –.” “No, we can’t. Because none of them will go.” Pierre swallowed. “Then I’ll go with you.” “No, you won’t.” “Why not?” “Because.” I struggled for an answer. I would welcome anyone’s help to hunt those beasts. Anyone but Pierre. “Because if anything happens to me, I need you to tell the others what I’ve done. Apart from that, I’m binding you to secrecy.” “What? But, Red –!” “Promise me. Promise you won’t tell anyone. If they know, they’ll try to stop me, the same way you are. If they stop me, no one else will hunt them. Then more people will be killed and it will never stop. Promise me.” All the color drained from his face, leaving him a helpless phantom. “… all right. I promise.” “Thank you, Pierre.” He looked about the shop. “If you won’t change your mind, at least let me supply you with some good weapons.” “I’ve already started.” He studied my pile of knives and ammunition. “That’s a good start, but you’ll need 169 more. If you’re right, these are no ordinary wolves. You’ll need extraordinary weapons. Too bad you can’t have your own set of claws, to even it up.” I lifted my father’s crossbow. “This should help, at least.” “Yeah,” Pierre said, studying the crossbow with a curious look. He continued to eye it carefully as he spoke. “I’ve actually been working on something for you. I meant to surprise you with it, but – guess I’d better give it to you now. I also designed some tools people could use to guard their homes, with all these attacks.” He shook his head. “Never thought I’d be giving them all to you, but – Let me find those boots, and, uh – a pair of extra trousers.” “Where are you getting those?” “… from my wardrobe.” I swallowed, sharing his discomfort. “… thank you.” He nodded and stepped away. “Let me get you some gloves, too. Should come in handy out there. I’ll be right back.” He dimmed the candles, lit a lantern and headed toward his room at the rear of the shop. For a moment, I felt warmer inside, knowing Pierre would give me all the protection he could. In the upper room a few minutes later, I untied my red hood and let it fall to the bed, then removed my cream dress. I donned Pierre’s ivory tunic and deerskin trousers, feeling perverse. I had 170 not worn pants since I was seven, when I had to borrow clothes from Doctor Renoire’s son. I wondered what my parents would think if they could see me tonight. Mama would grieve and abandon all hope that I would ever become a sophisticated woman. Papa might share her concern, but feel a sense of pride that I was doing what I had to do. What someone had to do. As I thought of them, I stifled a half-choking sob. But I had vowed to stop crying. It felt strange, preparing to go out in public with folds of cloth surrounding my legs. At the same time, I felt freedom to move, back and forth, twisting and turning, with no skirt getting in the way. I tied the cloak about my neck and stood, moving my toes about in the boots, getting used to the feel of them. I stepped back a few quick paces, then forth again, then spun about. My cloak twirled after me, threatening to catch against me the way my skirt used to. But there was little comparison. I had to be careful how I moved, to avoid wrapping my shoulders tightly into the cloak, but I wouldn’t fall over myself or tangle my legs together the way I might in a dress. And I needed the cloak to feel less exposed. I smiled. In this outfit, I could run and leap without holding back. I could climb or descend a hill fast, and quickly position myself to launch a bolt in any direction. Most important, I could fight. I could dodge or strike someone without fear of stumbling or appearing unladylike. I caught my reflection in the mirror and my heart sank. 171 I looked like a man. Not even a handsome man, but a pretentious dandy with blonde locks. Scarred and disfigured by some accident, now trying to compensate for it by dressing in a flowing silk shirt, cuffed leather boots and an oversized red cloak. I looked horrendous. I took a deep breath and released it. What did it matter how I looked? I had lived with my ugly scars for nine years. What did it matter if I looked even worse? I kept staring at myself – at the strange person in the mirror – and wondered what would become of me, if I even survived this night. Would anyone mourn the strange scarred girl from the sheep farm outside the village? But if I didn’t go, who would even be left to mourn? Those beasts would return, again and again. Picking us off one by one until they had eaten their fill. They had to be stopped. They had to be killed. I donned the hood. It shaded my eyes and made me look fearsome. Otherwise, I felt naked with my legs uncovered. But there was nothing I could do about it. I left the dress in the wardrobe, my legs exposed for all the world to see. I prepared to venture into the forest, looking like an animal. I descended the ladder. I heard Pierre scraping metal against metal, sharpening something, as I clomped onto the wood floor and stepped past the furnace to face him. He gasped. “Helena. You look –.” “Even less attractive, I know.” “Uh, no. Just, uh – just different.” 172 “How I look doesn’t matter. What matters is how well I can move, and I can move more freely in this.” “Uh – All right.” He continued to stare at me. At my legs in particular. “Are you sure you want to – go out like that?” “Are you sure you can’t stop staring?” I was glad the long cloak covered me from the rear or he might have had fits. “Sorry. It’s just odd to see you – I mean – for you to wear trousers.” I drew the cloak around myself a little, knowing how bizarre I looked. “Why should it matter? You’ve seen other men in trousers.” “Well, that’s a little different. I mean – they’re men.” He finally shook his head, like a dog shaking himself dry, and tore his eyes away from my legs. He returned his attention to the table, where he had arranged a couple of slim daggers he had sharpened, several bolts, and a rope and hook beside a pair of leather gloves. “I’ve been working on some things here to give you some extra help.” He demonstrated the various tools, including an impressive grappling hook for scaling a wall or a cliff face. Its prongs flicked out when he slid a metal catch open with his thumb. With each new device, I found myself more enchanted by his cleverness. Finally, he held up a crossbow, crowned with something that resembled a long snuff box. “What’s that?” 173 “Chinese repeating crossbow,” he said with pride. “I read about it and figured out how to build one. You load the top slot here –.” He dropped in ten bolts, one at a time. “Then you just keep pulling back on this top lever. Every time you pull back, it fires another bolt.” I almost yanked it from him. Then stared at the priceless treasure in my hands. “Pierre. This is – incredible. Thank you.” He shrugged. “Anything I can do to help. I figure, this way, you can fire again if you miss the first time.” I raised an eyebrow at him. “I won’t miss.” “All right, but – if you need to shoot again, you can fire right away.” I studied the crossbow up and down. It was pure genius. “This is perfect, Pierre. Two shots to make sure I kill it. With enough bolts to shoot down four more before I reload.” “Four – four more?” I squinted at him, wondering why he seemed surprised. “Wolves hunt in packs, Pierre. You know that. There were at least four that attacked Francois.” “Yeah, but I didn’t think – I mean, you can’t hunt them all down at once.” “I can try.” I tugged Pierre’s thick leather gloves on, then gathered my father’s crossbow and a handful of bolts. I slung the strap of Pierre’s repeating crossbow over my shoulder and grabbed tucked a few knives into a sheath, placing them in a leather pouch with the bolts, to hang from Crimson’s saddle. 174 I strode into the brisk evening with Pierre fast on my heels. Crimson turned sharply at the opening door, eager to be off. “Red, you’ll be careful, right? Promise you’ll watch yourself.” “I’ll watch myself.” I hooked the repeating crossbow onto the saddle, along with Papa’s crossbow and the ammunition pouch, then hoisted myself up. “With that red hood, they’ll see you coming a mile away.” I knew he was right. But I refused to live another day in fear. And this hooded cloak was the only thing bolstering my confidence to survive the night. “I want them to see me coming,” I said. He narrowed his eyes. “… What?” My blood surged. Crimson stamped his hooves, perhaps feeling the same fire. “I want to make them afraid, the way they made us afraid. Whatever those things are, I want them to know one of us is fighting back.” Pierre gaped, as if uncertain what to think. “Red, what are you going to do?” I set my jaw like stone. “Something.” I spurred Crimson forth. He snorted and charged ahead. Lightning stabbed at the horizon as Pierre called after me. I saw Father Vestille on his Palomino, trotting toward L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. We met with surprised eyes and I fumbled with the reins, nearly making Crimson stumble before he galloped past. Father Vestille tugged his horse to a halt and struggled to turn about. 175 “Helena! Helena, come back!” he called. I can only imagine how he would react to the bare trousers beneath my flapping cloak. I might be cast out of the church. It no longer mattered. I still had faith, but I had lost all patience. If he put me out of the church for trying to save our province, so be it. The cries of Pierre and Father Vestille echoed behind me, farther and farther away as I galloped through the darkening streets. 176 177 178 MY DISCOVERY 179 180 19. Rain started to drizzle as I arrived at La Maison de Touraine, but it didn’t dampen the wild revelry within its walls. I could see why Mama often referred to taverns as “dens”. The crowd inside rumbled like a pack of growling beasts. I had never set foot in this place except for the banquet to honor Francois, the night he died. But La Maison was a center for local gossip. The perfect starting place to learn what anyone knew about the wolves. Someone must have heard rumors or witnessed recent attacks. 181 An alcoholic stench filled the misty air. I wished for a safer way to seek information. My parents would have preferred that I forget this place altogether. But Francois had told me to seek out his friend if I ever needed help. As we trotted toward the hitching post, two men on the front porch stopped their conversation and stared. At the red horse and its red-cloaked rider. The short man’s mouth hung open. I wondered how much I resembled the Apocalyptic horseman that brought a plague of war. Though I doubted this squat man or his liquor bottle spent much time listening to the Scriptures. “Evening, Monsieur,” he greeted. I said nothing as I swung off Crimson’s flank to plant both boots together on the ground. I had no business with this man and his tone seemed more demanding than friendly. “I said, ‘Evening,’” Squat repeated. He and his slim mustached companion stepped between me and the entrance. “Evening,” I muttered. The mustached man squinted at me. He grabbed at my shoulder and spun me to face him. I looked up in his astonished face. “Why, she’s a girl!” he sputtered. “What sort of game do you think you’re playing, Mademoiselle?” Squat demanded. “This ain’t no place for someone like you.” I swallowed down fear and anger. I had no time for this. “I’ll see for myself and let you know,” I said. 182 I started forward. Moustache moved to block me. Behind me, Crimson grumbled and shifted uneasily, while Squat took another swig of his bottle. “You should listen to your betters, Mademoiselle,” Moustache said. “If you want some drinks, I’ll show you where to find some. More private, away from all these gawkers.” Crimson snorted, ready to charge him. “Step aside, Monsieurs,” I warned. Squat chuckled and glanced at Moustache, who laughed along. “Now, now, Mademoiselle. You didn’t say, ‘please’.” I pulled my crossbow from beneath my cloak and aimed its bolt-end directly beneath Squat’s jowls. They stopped laughing abruptly as my other hand settled on the lever. “Please.” Squat nodded, slow and careful, backing away to let me pass. I lowered the crossbow, measuring their reactions. Satisfied that they would not bother me further, I concealed it beneath my cloak once more. “Would you look after my horse while I’m inside? He sometimes gets agitated around strangers.” Squat and Moustache turned to Crimson, who glared back with eyes that seemed to spit flame. “Yeah,” Moustache said dully. “Sure.” “Why, thank you,” I said. Moustache took a step toward me and Crimson stamped his hoof. Both men spread their arms as they backed up to the wall. Crimson would have no trouble with them. 183 I moved to the oak doors and pushed inside. Into a room of noise and smoke and wild laughter. Where men dressed formally but acted foolishly, and a handful of women moved from table to table, dressed even less modestly than I was, serving drinks and letting men gawk at them from every angle. At the bar counter, separated from the chaos surrounding him, stood a plump man with thinning auburn hair. He talked with two men there as he busied himself polishing a wooden mug. The man I had come to see. The tavern owner, Gerard Touraine. I strode toward the counter, noting the quiet that came in my wake. Like the ripples of a swan wading through a polluted stream. Everyone seemed dumbstruck at the sight of me. Including the men at the counter who watched me approach. For a moment, none of them spoke. “That’s quite a cloak, Monsieur,” said Touraine, wiping the mug in his hand. He turned to put it away and grab a new one from the pegs on the wall. I didn’t know if he had meant that as a compliment. I assumed not. “Thank you.” Touraine stopped and turned on his heel. He took a step toward me and crouched to peer at my mouth beneath the hood. “Eh – are you lost, Mademoiselle?” he asked with a chuckle. Then his face fell. “Wait. You’re that little girl, from Francois’ party. With the, eh –.” His hand rose to make a gesture at his face. He stopped himself before making reference to my 184 scars. I appreciated that. “Francois saved my life,” I said. “He was a good friend of mine.” “Yes,” Touraine said. He cleared his throat. “Mine, too.” One of the other men laughed. “What’s this, Gerard? Your niece paying you a visit? Or is it someone else, eh?” He nudged his friend on the next wooden stool and both men chuckled. Touraine ignored them, focusing on me. “Uh – I’m afraid women aren’t allowed in here, Mademoiselle.” I glanced at the tall brunette leaning over a table of men with her hands on her hips. “She is a woman.” “Of course, but she’s – eh –.” “She has a point, Gerard,” the other man insisted. “That is definitely a woman over there. So it stands to reason, if this mademoiselle insists upon –.” “Enough,” Touraine said, silencing him. “She’s made a mistake. She came to the wrong place, nothing more.” I climbed up onto the stool across from him. I had never sat in such a high chair. But then, I started wearing trousers before today, either. “All I want is a drink.” Touraine shook his head, his brown eyes apologizing. “I couldn’t serve you.” “Oh, come now, Gerard.” The man fished out some coins to toss on the counter. “Here, Mademoiselle. I’ll buy you one.” 185 “Move on,” Touraine ordered the men. “I’ll handle this. Find yourselves a table. We’ll talk later.” The second man held up his hands. “We’re only teasing her, Gerard. Don’t get excited.” Touraine leaned toward them suddenly, almost menacing. “Find a table,” he repeated. The men climbed awkwardly down from their stools and walked away, staring over their shoulders at Touraine as he watched them go. “I only want water,” I said. “Can you serve me that?” Touraine paused to consider, then turned to grab a fresh mug. “I am also curious,” I said as he filled it. “You’re curious?” he asked, amused. “You enter a tavern with that huge cloak and you’re curious. Very well. What are you curious about, Mademoiselle?” “Wolves.” His wrist twitched, then continued to fill the mug. He set it on the counter before me, his head down. He looked up. “Wolves in general?” “Wolves in particular. A large wolf that killed a little girl near here.” “Heard about that. Tragic.” “She was my sister.” Touraine buried his heavy gaze in the floor. “… Very sorry, Mademoiselle.” “I’m curious about that wolf. A lot of people pass through here. Have you heard anything about it?” 186 He narrowed his eyes, looking confused. “Why should I tell you if I did?” “Tell me tonight and you’ll know why tomorrow.” He stepped around the counter. “I think someone should see you home, Mademoiselle.” “I have no home,” I said. The sudden rise in my voice stopped him cold. “The wolves took it from me.” “Well, what about your parents?” My shoulders trembled as I thought of Mama and Papa and Suzette. I stiffened to hide it. “… The wolves took everything.” He swallowed. “I’m so sorry, Mademoiselle. I am. But I don’t see how I can help you.” “You can’t tell me what you know about the wolves that killed my mother and father and little sister? That keep killing off more and more people in the village? I only want to know what they are, what they might be doing.” “Look. I understand you’re hurting. But whatever killed your parents and your sister is dangerous. Probably more dangerous than you can imagine. It’s no business of mine and certainly no business of yours. And I don’t think you want me to hear of another young girl’s death tomorrow. Do you?” “But you have heard things. Haven’t you?” He started to say something. Then chewed on his lip. “I think they’re the same wolves that killed Francois,” I prodded. 187 “Francois was a good man,” he said, his lip protruding in a sideways pout. “A very good man.” “He was too late to save my Grand’Mere from the wolf, but he saved me. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. He was my hero. He still is. He’s the one who sent me to you.” Touraine shot a look at me and narrowed his eyes. “How’s that?” “He said if I ever needed to know anything about anything in the village or beyond, you would be the one to ask.” That was not quite true. Francois had told me to seek Touraine out if I got in real trouble. But this qualified. I needed help and Touraine was the one who could give it. I pressed on. “He also said people need to stand up and do something to help others. Or there would be more killings. More children suffering. He said we can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s right, because some things are worth fighting for.” Touraine lifted his chin. “Francois said that?” I stiffened my jaw. “Yes.” He stared hard at me. Then relaxed. “Yeah, that sounds like something Francois would say. Good man.” “But he’s gone now,” I said, leaning forward on the stool. “He’s dead. A pack of wolves broke into his home and killed him.” Touraine nodded. “I know.” “You also know something about those wolves. I’m a good hunter. If you tell me, I can 188 stop some of them, at least. If you don’t, they’ll keep killing.” He still hesitated, but seemed intrigued. Almost believing me. “Please.” He studied me another moment. Then he resumed his position behind the counter and leaned over it. “If I don’t tell you, I expect you’ll find out from someone else. Won’t you?” I nodded. “All right, Mademoiselle. Don’t ask anyone but me. Understand? You want to know anything, or if something is true, you come straight to me, no one else.” “I will,” I promised. I meant it. This was exactly what I wanted. Touraine glanced from one side of the bar to the other. Then he began to polish a new mug as he spoke in a low murmur. “I don’t know much, Mademoiselle. Some men come in here regularly, and they seem to know something about those wolves. Always eager for news about them, just like you. Always asking for details about recent attacks. It’s odd. They seem delighted by it, like someone’s telling a joke. Lately they’ve been asking about Monsieur Favreau’s farm.” “Monsieur Favreau?” “Pig farmer on the other side of the hill, west end of the forest. Lost four of his fattest pigs to a wolf over the last two weeks. He’s worried he’ll lose the rest, though he’s got plenty to spare, if you ask me.” “When did he lose them?” 189 Touraine rubbed his stubbly chin. “One was two nights ago, the other two nights before that.” He narrowed his eyes and blinked with sudden realization. “Seems it’s been every two nights since it took the first one. Following a pattern.” “Which continues tonight,” I said, finishing the thought that was surely brewing in his mind. I rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle, your drink.” I retrieved the mug. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” I downed the water in one long swallow and returned the mug before heading to the door. “Mademoiselle?” I turned at the door. He looked helpless as a child. “I trust – you have someone to look after you?” “Yes,” I said, stepping out into the storm. “I am.” I let the door thud behind me. 190 20. Favreau’s farm was easy enough to find. I just followed the smell. Even in the rain, the distinctive odor of pig manure spread for a mile. Smoke rose from a thin chimney above the farmer’s spacious cabin, set in a broad clearing surrounded by dense forest. A long narrow pigpen sat beside it, the large pigs kicking up mud and manure as the silvery moon rose above the trees. To the left of the pen sat a small and well-kept stable, large enough to keep two or more horses. 191 Monsieur Favreau would have his eyes and ears pricked for any intruders. He must have noticed the same pattern of attack by now, how the wolf seized one of his pigs every other night. Tonight he could expect to lose another one. I climbed down from the saddle and led Crimson carefully around the perimeter. He moved so cautiously, I don’t think he broke a single twig. Hidden from the cabin windows by the horse stable, I crept toward it, leading Crimson. As we came around the corner, Monsieur Favreau’s black horse started in alarm, stamping and neighing. I quickly found the feedbag, hanging from a hook on the wall, and grabbed a handful of oats. I opened my hand for the horse to see and sniff. He calmed immediately and let me approach so he could nibble from my hand. I shared some with his companion, who had just woken, then grabbed more oats to feed them again. Once they relaxed, I brought Crimson into the stable to stand between their twin stalls. I scanned the clearing. Nothing moved in the dark woods around the farm, though the drizzle made it difficult to be certain. I hoped that any wolves would have equal trouble spotting me. Dim light issued from within the house. Monsieur Favreau must have lit a lantern to keep a late vigil over his property. I grabbed more oats and prepared to lay the pile in my skirt. Then I remembered I was no longer wearing one. I stuffed them in my pants pockets instead, wishing I could store more. I 192 reminded myself that the trousers still gave me the best advantage. I crouched and crept toward the pen. A few pigs squealed upon seeing me approach in my sweeping cloak. I scattered a few oats at them, and they returned to their agitated pacing. Farmer Favreau wasn’t the only one anxious about the wolves tonight. I crawled carefully between the wooden bars of their pen. The pigs backed away and huddled against one another, but they no longer cried out. They gradually spread apart to move freely about the pen once more, though they kept an eye on me, snorting little warnings as they passed by. I crouched in the filthy mud and slop and waited, forcing my senses to adapt to the intolerable smell. At least the rain would wash away some of the manure from my clothes, once I left the pen. But that would be a long time in coming. I would keep vigil until the wolf arrived. I felt the crossbow at my hip. Not my father’s, but Pierre’s Chinese repeating crossbow. As brave as I made myself appear to everyone else, I couldn’t afford to miss or waste time reloading. I sat for over twenty minutes. By then, the pigs seemed to regard me as part of their pen – a piece of scenery to walk around as they continued their nervous pacing. Nearly half of them had fallen asleep. The others seemed as tense as I was. I finally sat in the slop. My knees and thighs were tired, and I no longer cared how I looked or smelled, or what I had to scrub off the 193 cloak later. In any case, this almost guaranteed that the Leóne family would not ask for it back. I leaned against the gate post, turning my head now and then to check for anything approaching from behind the farmhouse. It felt good to finally rest. Nervous as I was, my shoulders and head felt heavy. I closed my eyes and thought of Suzette. Sweet, pure Suzette. Playing among the white daffodils in our meadow, running from me and laughing, her golden hair streaming in the biting wind. I saw her run toward the dark forest. Beyond the first line of trees, the woods were black as coal. Except for the eyes. More than a dozen pairs of eyes, shining from the darkness. “Suzette, stop!” Papa called from behind me. “Come back!” “Suzette, no! Suzette!” Mama screamed. Suzette continued to laugh and run in an irregular pattern, playing a game of escaping me, escaping us all, while the eyes watched from the forest. “Suzette, turn around!” It was Francois Revelier shouting, beckoning her back. Suzette wouldn’t listen. “Helena, go after her!” Papa told me. “Bring her back!” I stood where I was. I watched Suzette, laughing and playing as she drew closer to the forest. “Go, Helena!” Mama urged. “You can get her! Bring her back!” 194 “But the wolves …” I muttered. I felt a tremor through my skin, like a spider crawling up my spine. “You can bring her back, Helena,” Francois said. “You’re the only one who can do it.” Suzette giggled and dodged back and forth, closer and closer to the forest. To the waiting eyes that had grown in number, nearly twenty of them now. “But they’ll kill me, too …” “Helena,” Mama said in a quiet voice. “Helena, please …” “You can do it, Helena,” Papa said. “Bring her back. Bring her back.” A tear flowed down my cheek. “I can’t …” Suzette’s laughter echoed from the forest’s edge. “Can’t catch me!” Then she turned and ran straight into the dark abyss, where teeth flashed open beneath each pair of eyes. “Papa?” I started suddenly. Soft rain fell on my cheeks and I rankled at the damp odor of pig manure. The tiny voice came from the front porch. A little freckled girl stood there in her nightgown, staring out into the dark clearing. I looked and saw a heavyset man standing between puddles, holding a musket. Farmer Favreau, no doubt, watching for the wolves. I had dozed off. Never even noticed him leaving the house. As he surveyed the outer perimeter of trees, I craned my neck, letting the rain needle down on me. Moonlight shone between 195 rolling clouds, directly overhead. I had slept nearly an hour. I looked back at Favreau as his gun whirled in my direction. Its barrel aimed squarely at my hooded forehead. I sat frozen in the mud and darkness. The bearded Favreau stood rigid, squinting through rain at the pigpen. Watching for any movement, listening for any strange sounds. I made none. He finally relented and turned slowly back to the trees, while rain pelted the surrounding leaves. I felt my heart start beating again. “Lucille, go back to bed,” he called over his shoulder, still watching the forest. “I’m not sleepy, Papa,” the girl complained, rubbing her eyes. I estimated her to be four years old. A year younger than Suzette, but just as lively, just as playful. Just as innocent. “Get back inside,” I muttered in a violent whisper. “Into bed,” he repeated. “Your mother wouldn’t have wanted you out in this cold, God rest her soul. Now go on.” I swallowed. He was a widower, raising little Lucille on his own. Just the two of them. “Papa, what’re you doing? Did you hear the wolf?” I felt my breath through my teeth. I alternated between my study of the trees and of the light from Favreau’s house, shining on little Lucille’s white gown. “Get back inside,” I murmured again. 196 “I heard something,” Favreau said over his shoulder. “Might be that wolf, so go on inside, like I told you.” “Yes, Papa,” she said. The rising irritation in his voice finally convinced her. My shoulders relaxed. “Look, Papa! There it is!” Blood flooded my temples as I sat higher. Lucille was right. Striding forth from the forest was a gray wolf – taller and larger than a normal wolf. It grinned, showing no fear of the musket. Perhaps it had never seen one. Or simply didn’t fear it. The rain fell harder as I raised Pierre’s crossbow. If the wolf didn’t fear a bullet, it certainly wouldn’t fear a bolt. Until I sank enough of them into its belly. At least, that’s what I hoped. It padded through the muddy field toward Favreau. As if daring him to shoot. “Get inside, Lucille,” Favreau ordered. “Kill it, Papa. Kill it before it takes another pig!” “Inside, I said!” Favreau couldn’t escort his daughter to safety and face down the wolf at the same time. He leaned his head to one side and sighted the animal patiently. Letting it draw closer into range, he waited for the right shot and pulled the trigger. A beautiful shot, right to its face. It sent the beast spinning backward to the slippery ground, dead. 197 Favreau lifted his head as Lucille jumped up and down on the porch, her fists raised in victory. “You did it, Papa, you did it!” The clearing fell quiet. The creature was dead. It was over. I was never even needed. I felt relieved and strangely cheated. But I couldn’t help but feel grateful over the huge wolf carcass lying still on the soaked grass. Then four more wolves padded into the clearing. They emerged at once, from four different positions, like an organized battalion. Grinning, they marched at Monsieur Favreau like soldiers, each as large as the first one. 198 21. Favreau stood gaping at the gathering wolves, his fingers loosening and tightening on his gun. The wolves moved closer, ignoring their fallen companion as the mounting rain pelted his carcass. “Papa, there’s more of them!” “… get back inside,” he said quietly. He started to back away slowly. The wolves picked up their pace. 199 Favreau continued to back up. He lifted his musket to a firing position, but abandoned the effort as the wolves kept coming, kept grinning. They weren’t rushing at the pigs, or even at Favreau. They focused their attention beyond him, at the porch. At Lucille. My head pounded with terror. They had planned this, waited for this opportunity. They stole a pig every couple of nights to draw the family out into the open, until they found an opportunity to attack Favreau’s daughter. Then they all emerged at once, the same way they must have attacked Francois at his home. Favreau would never get Lucille inside before the beasts devoured them both. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and sliced into the side of a pig. It squealed and ran to the other side of the pen. The wolves jerked toward the commotion as the pigs began to rush back and forth, thumping and sliding against one another. I cut into another one, encouraging their panic. Two wolves sniffed the air, perhaps smelling the flow of animal blood. I rose, my cloak billowing up from my shoulders as I brandished the crossbow. The wolves gaped along with Favreau and his daughter as I rushed between the pigs to the gate. I kicked up at the top bar to flip it open, flinging rainwater. The pigs spilled out of the pen, slipping and stumbling as they darted back and forth across the clearing. 200 The wolves continued to stare as I marched out of the pen and fired at the nearest brown beast, piercing its chest. It fell to the ground hard. The others snarled and charged, struggling for traction. “Get inside,” I ordered Favreau. “Who are you?” “Get inside!” I stepped sideways, angling to face the next wolf as it approached. The others closed in, eyeing me warily. I pulled back twice on the crossbow’s lever, firing one bolt into the first animal’s gut, the other into its paw. My racing pulse had thrown off my aim, but I had wounded it. Enough that it stayed down. I moved in a curving path between the pigs as they skidded across the muddy grass. The remaining wolves circled around me, craning to peer over the herd for a path to get at me. Between the wild flurry of pigs and the misty haze, I couldn’t tell whether there were two or three wolves closing in. They ignored Favreau and his daughter as he scuttled her into the house and shut the door. That was all that mattered. The wolves bared their teeth, dripping with saliva. I registered three of them surrounding me, a gray one to my left, brown to my right, and black behind me. The rain had played tricks on my eyes. What seemed like a perfect hit on the second wolf must have only grazed him. Two of them charged, one from each side. The gray one leaped at me as I whirled to launch a bolt into its stomach. It spun and rolled aside, howling, while I dropped backward to the ground, 201 planting my elbows in the mud. I kicked at a pig as it scurried in front of me, thrusting it at the attacking brown wolf. The startled pig knocked it several feet away, stopping it for a second. Long enough for me to roll to one side and fire a bolt into his companion behind me. Then to fire two more into the brown wolf as it bore down on me, dropping it to the puddle-soaked field. I scrambled to my feet. Three bolts left. The gray wolf rose to its feet, staggering a moment before it turned to lunge. I fired once, keeping my final bolts in reserve. It spun to the ground as the black wolf struggled to all fours and sprang at me. Another bolt finished it as the gray wolf reared back to lunge again. I tugged on the lever, sinking my last bolt into its heart. It fell in a heap and lay still. I stood in the quiet. Chest heaving in the drizzling rain. Waiting for my pulse and heartbeat to slow while the remaining pigs squealed and ran in circles through the clearing. My hands shook. I took deep breaths, ordering my arms and shoulders to relax. I reached into my pouch for another round of bolts and started loading them into the top slot, one by one, in case there were more of them. … More of them … I turned back to the clearing, where the first gray wolf had fallen. The grass there was matted down a little, where the animal had lain. But the wolf was now gone. The rain wasn’t playing tricks on my eyes. Four wolves had come from the forest, but after I 202 struck down the first one, four wolves remained. Only one of the wolves was gray. The first wolf, the one Favreau shot with his musket. It had risen to join the others and attack me again. The wolf nearest to me – the one I shot four times – groaned and rolled to its side. Then it rose and shook its head to recover. I watched, crossbow ready, as it studied its wounded paw, from which a bolt still protruded. Two similar bolts remained embedded in its stomach. It lifted the paw to its teeth, bit hard on the bolt, and tugged, nearly dislodging it. Then the creature set its paw down and reached for the bolt with its other paw. I gaped as it wrapped its claws around the bolt to seize a firm hold – the way a human would – and pulled it out. It dropped the bloody bolt to the ground and regarded me, while I blinked at the impossible feat. Crimson whinnied from his hiding place in the stable. He burst into the clearing, pounding toward me at full gallop. I grabbed onto his saddle as the wolf’s jaws opened to chomp at my legs. Crimson whisked me away and raced into the woods, as I clung to him with one foot in the stirrup. Behind me, three other wolves rose in similar fashion, grinning and showing little signs of the battle. Crimson knew when to run. 203 22. Crimson thundered through the misting rain over twigs and pine needles, as I hung precariously alongside. Pressing hard into the stirrup, I grabbed the saddle’s horn and tugged myself onto his back to settle onto him. I crouched low against his neck as he galloped through the black woods, leaving Favreau’s drenched farm behind. My fingers ached from their grip around the repeating crossbow but I refused to let go of it, despite how little it had helped me. What were these creatures that looked 204 like wolves, but withstood bullets and pulled metal bolts from their paws? Clinging to Crimson, I glanced back at the monsters chasing us. Up ahead, more pairs of red and yellow eyes leered from the darkness. I tugged at the reins and Crimson skidded to a halt, twisting to one side. Three wolves strolled out from behind tree trunks, cutting off our exit while the others closed in from behind. I tugged Crimson to the right. Two more pairs of eyes blazed in the distance. The wolves that owned them padded into the spreading moonlight. I continued circling. Another wolf loped toward us from the opposite direction. We were dead. I swallowed and drew Pierre’s crossbow. If I sank enough bolts into one of them – just one of them – it might bring him down. It was the best I could do. I was about to die, like my family. Like Francois. I would never know love. Never have children. Never see Pierre or Father Vestille or Monsieur Laurent or anyone else again. And no one in the village would know that I had died in a foolish attempt to save them. But I could still honor Suzette, if I could kill one of these monsters. Just one. The wolves blocking our escape stood ready to attack, yet they restrained themselves. I turned about to face the wolves that had chased us from the farm. Their gray leader strode toward me, his three companions following close behind. I choked back a sob. Why did I have to die? A young girl, scarred and helpless and stupid 205 enough to fight these creatures because I knew that someone needed to. Why should I die while these beasts lived to kill again? I had six bolts. It was all that could load before the wolves rose to chase me. I fired the first one. It sank into the gray wolf’s chest, throwing him backward in a tumble. The others waited as it lay on the ground. Then it rolled back to its feet, the bolt protruding from its shoulder. One of his companions padded over to him and yanked the bolt out with its teeth. Then they marched forward. I fired another. I struck him in the same place, close to his shoulder wound, hoping to weaken it. Surely their blood couldn’t flow fast enough to heal the same damaged spot. The wolf rolled backward, grunting against the pain of the blow. Then it rose to its feet again, letting another wolf tear the bolt out. They continued to advance on me as an organized mob. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I fired a third bolt. It gleamed in the moonlight as it flew, striking the wolf in the center of his skull. The animal tipped backward and its eyes rolled in a look of surprise. It spun onto its back and lay on the ground. It did not move. The forest fell quiet. The other wolves gaped at it. Not with anger or fear, but a look of actual shock. They turned toward me and I shuddered. I raised the crossbow with its pitiful three bolts 206 remaining. As I wondered how it would feel to be torn apart and eaten. Instead of attacking, the pack stared at me with wide eyes, as if frightened. Or awestruck. They backed away. I turned Crimson to face the two wolves behind me, expecting them to pounce. But at my sudden turn, they skittered backward. So did the wolves on either side. I turned Crimson again to face them, measuring their reactions. They turned and ran off in all directions, howling and scrambling as if I had set them on fire. The leader’s carcass remained still on the damp ground. Rain dripped like a drum from the tree leaves, as I felt the wild pounding of my heart. Crimson shuffled his hooves in the mud, looking from one side of the dark forest to the other as though he shared my relief and confusion. One bolt – one single bolt – had killed this beast, when every other one failed. What sort of monsters were these? I waited for a few seconds. Resting in the quiet and calm and the cooling breeze from the dissipating rain. I dismounted and touched down carefully on the ground, as though I expected it to swallow me up. But nothing happened. No wolves returned. The gray wolf leader didn’t rise to attack. Its mouth hung open with no breath, no movement. The beast was dead as a fallen log. As any wolf should be after being shot seven times. But why didn’t the first six bolts kill it? Why only the seventh? And why only this wolf? 207 I recalled the wolves from the clearing. This first one entered and was shot by Monsieur Favreau. Four more joined it, and this gray wolf rose up to attack alongside them. But only four of them followed us from the farm. I grabbed hold of the bolt lodged in the wolf’s forehead and pulled. I pressed my boot heel over its open eye and tugged, but it wouldn’t budge. I flicked out one of Pierre’s blades and cut into the forehead around the bolt, sawing until I made a wide bloody hole. The quieting rain turned the fresh blood even fouler. I swallowed back the bile rising in my throat and spat on the ground. I seized the bolt with both fists, pressed my boot against the animal’s face and yanked hard. The bolt came free all at once. I fell onto my rump holding the shaft, its end covered with blood and bits of bone and flesh. I shut my eyes and quieted my soul a moment. Then I stared at the mess of flesh and fur matted with blood. Underneath it, the bolt looked the same as every other one. What made it so powerful? I stood and shoved it into the pouch hanging from Crimson’s saddle. He flinched slightly. His stomach seemed stronger than mine, but not much stronger. I mounted and returned to the Favreau farm. I drove Crimson hard, but he needed little encouragement. He seemed just as eager to escape the forest and find shelter before the wolves returned. Favreau’s farm was the last place I wanted to be, but we had to go back. 208 It took little over a minute to reach the clearing. A dim lantern still burned within the house. Favreau might be watching us from inside or rocking his daughter back to sleep, or both. Near the house, a single brown wolf lay still, unmoving. Dead. We trotted up to it and I swung down from the saddle, landing on both feet. I ran to the carcass and rolled it onto its back. Two bolts stuck out from its belly. But blood surrounded only one bolt, in the animal’s stomach. The other bolt yielded no blood, even though it had struck the wolf’s heart. I pressed my boot against its pelt and tugged the bolt free. It pulled far more easily than the one from the gray wolf’s skull. I stared at the bloodstained bolt in the moonlight, turning it back and forth in my fist. I shot and killed this wolf the same way I had killed the gray wolf. Why did these two die when the rest of the wolves survived every attack? Something howled in the distance. Crimson and I whirled toward the forest. I shoved the bolt into the pouch with the other one and hurled myself onto Crimson’s back. We fled, leaving the large wolf carcass for Favreau to clean up in the morning, if he ever chose to leave his house again. I had to find out how Pierre forged these two bolts. And I had to live long enough to do it. 209 23. We charged through the forest, pounding over twigs and pine needles as the rain turned to mist. Back to the village and to L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne, the only home I had now. How long it would remain a home, I couldn’t know. But Pierre and his parents had to let me stay at least one more night! Another howl rang through the trees, closer than the first. The wolves had picked up our scent. Crimson thundered ahead without any prodding. My sides ached from the jarring ride, but 210 I refused to restrain him. Not with so much forest to cover. The howling increased, from two or more wolves. They could be organizing themselves, picking out a trail, searching for us. They would find us in minutes. Well before we reached the village. A growing chorus of howls rose as we raced on, sweating in the fresh humidity. They would surround us again, in greater numbers. This time, they would not hold back. “Helena? Helena!” I gasped. Had someone called me? I wished it was possible, this deep into the forest. I tugged on Crimson’s reins for a moment. “Helena! Helena, is that you?” I froze in the saddle. Crimson stamped his hooves, eager to flee. I scanned the area, searching between black trees. A horse approached from the fog, its rider bearing a lantern. The trotting silhouette took on a dark shape, lightening as it drew closer. Beneath the wide-brimmed hat, Father Vestille’s eyes held a look of horror. “Helena! Helena, what’s happened? Are you all right?” I couldn’t answer as he came toward us, appearing from nowhere. I was too exhausted to think. “Helena, what’s wrong? I’ve been searching everywhere for you.” The wolves howled again, less than half a mile away. I jerked at the sound. 211 Father Vestille studied the woods behind us. “You went after them, didn’t you? The wolves.” I said nothing. He turned sharply at another shrill howl. “They’re closing in. Come. My hovel is nearby.” He turned and took Crimson’s reins, leading us away at a fast trot. I said nothing, did nothing to resist. The battle and blood and terror left me numb and aching. I only wanted to sleep. To sleep without dreams or nightmares. We continued through the woods at a steady pace. Father Vestille focused on the muddy path, seeming to ignore the wolves’ terrible howls. We entered the little clearing where his house stood, a sturdy structure of clay and large stones, small but protected. For the first time since my childhood, the sight of Father Vestille’s hovel warmed my heart. A place to lie down and rest, where the wolves could not break in. I was so intent on returning to Monsieur Leóne’s shop that I had never considered retreating to Father Vestille’s home. Of course, I would never have accepted his invitation tonight if I wasn’t so desperate. He led us to his stable behind the cottage and jumped down from his saddle. He looked about, then led his Palomino into its stall, closed the gate and moved to the pile of hay beside it. I sat atop Crimson, heart pounding, chest heaving. The wolves would find this stable any moment. But I waited, my mind and body numb. Waited for Father Vestille to hurry! 212 Even if I hid in the stone house, the wolves would pass by here soon and catch Crimson’s scent. My throat went dry as I imagined them feeding on his flanks while I drifted off to sleep in the warm cottage. We couldn’t stay here. We would have to race on to the village and take our slim chances. Father Vestille set down his lantern and grabbed a pitchfork from the wall. Then he started to rake and pitch hay aside in a mad rush. I froze, exhausted and horrified at his sudden desire to clean. His own fear had driven him mad. He cleared the hay in front of the stalls and set the pitchfork back in place. Two narrow wooden doors, over twelve feet across, had been built into the floor. I blinked. “What is that?” He glanced about once more, then pulled up on the ropes attached to each door handle. Hay and dust fell from them, making my nose twitch. I waved it away and squinted at the wooden ramp extending beneath them. It led deep into the earth below Father Vestille’s hovel. He retrieved his lantern and beckoned us forward. Crimson took a cautious step, then permitted Father Vestille to lead him by his reins down the broad ramp. I expected to duck my head as we descended, but found that even Crimson could stand upright on the ramp and in the long musty room below. A dust-laden cot stood in a cobwebbed corner, opposite some wooden crates of ammunition and gunpowder in the far corner. 213 “The man who sold me this property was a retired soldier,” Father Vestille said in an urgent hush. “He built this underground shelter during the Spanish War, to hide supplies and weapons. I’ve since used it to hide refugees, but not since the War of the Territories.” Near the cot sat a sturdy, long forgotten rocking chair. In addition to soldiers, this place had housed families and mothers with small children. Who had Father Vestille hidden down here? Crimson snorted at something on the far right. I wrinkled my nose at the molded hay strewn across the floor, next to a hitching post built into the wall. This cellar had been designed to hide horses as well as their riders. A true shelter. Sheer genius. “I’ll clean that out of here and get some fresh hay in the morning,” Father Vestille said, setting his lantern on a table. “I’m afraid you’ll have to endure the odor for tonight. Come. Let’s get you cleaned up so you can rest.” I climbed down, but ignored Father Vestille’s offered hand. Instead, I led Crimson to the hitching post, letting Father Vestille hurry back up the ramp to pull both doors shut. He tramped back down as I removed Crimson’s saddle to let him bed down beside the old hay. He gave no argument, showing the same exhaustion I felt. I turned back to Father Vestille. He paled. “Helena, what – what happened? Who did this to you?” He wasn’t staring at the blood or patches of wolf fur or even the manure staining my clothes. 214 Only the trousers that shamelessly exposed my legs to the world. “I did,” I said weakly. “What?” He stared as though I had told him I stuck my hands into a fire. “I can’t explain right now. I just – just want to rest.” He gaped at me for a moment longer, then recovered. “Of course, of course.” He moved to the old cot and lit a candle on the table beside it. “Let me clean this off so you can lie down.” “There’s no need,” I said, dropping backward onto the mattress and sending up a cloud of old dust. I shut my eyes and shielded my nose. I couldn’t get any filthier. “Helena. We should clean you up …” “I just want … to sleep …” The wolves howled from the forest above us, their cries now faint. I opened my eyes to see Father Vestille studying the ceiling. He listened intently for a moment, then turned back to me. “All right, Helena. I’ll be back for you in the morning. Get some rest. And … tomorrow, we can talk. All right?” I didn’t answer or make any promise. I just stared back at him, tired and weak. He nodded, as if we had agreed on something, and stepped away. He left the candle burning for me, to give off a dim light. Finally safe, finally free for a few hours, I shut my eyes and descended into heavy sleep. 215 24. I awoke with a start as something pounded in the darkness. I sat up in bed and blinked, trying to distinguish shapes and remember where I was. Had I returned to Pierre’s loft? My head ached as if something was hammering my skull. The pounding continued from above. I squinted in the hazy light. The candle had burned down to a fuming spark, but dusty rays of light shone through cracks and holes in the ceiling. “Helena, are you awake?” Father Vestille’s voice was muffled. 216 “I’m –,” I started, hearing the harsh rasp of my voice. I cleared my throat and called louder. “I’m awake. You can come down.” One of the long shaft doors creaked open, shedding more light on the tiered ramp. Something surged inside me, a strange sense of hope and freedom that I couldn’t understand. Then Father Vestille’s boots descended the thin boards of the ramp, carrying a tray of food. He wore plain tan trousers and suspenders with a linen shirt. I wrinkled my brow, feeling even more like an intruder. I had rarely seen him without his priestly robe, not since I was a child. He looked tired and worried. “Good morning,” he said. He moved past Crimson, who was rousing himself from the floor, as I sat up in bed. He set the tray on a small table beside the cot. Warm bread and cheese and smoked sausage. The welcome smells nearly overcame the cellar’s musty odor. My stomach rumbled as I closed my dry mouth. Why did I suddenly feel so safe here? Not just in this secret hideaway, but under Father Vestille’s care? He pulled up a stool beside the bed, sliding it past the rocking chair. “Go ahead, Helena. I’m sure you must be famished.” I swallowed. “Thank you.” I started in, seizing the bread with a ferocity that startled me. I didn’t realize how hungry I was. How tired and sore. I felt like a wounded stray puppy Father Vestille had rescued from the forest. 217 He watched me, saying nothing. As though he wanted to make certain I ate. “Do you mind if I join you?” I chewed on one side of my mouth to answer. “Of course. It’s your food.” He smiled. Then he closed his eyes and crossed himself, mouthing a silent prayer. I stopped chewing, feeling ashamed. It never occurred to me to give thanks for the meal, as I normally would. I was too hungry. He lifted his head and opened his eyes. “I’m sorry I didn’t pray.” He shrugged. “The Lord understands. I expect you’ve had quite an ordeal.” I chewed quietly on the bread. He glanced at my legs, covered only by trousers, then looked away, embarrassed. He met my eyes. “Can you tell me what happened?” I kept chewing. He waited for me to swallow. “… It’s more than I can explain.” He frowned, studying my face. “Very well.” He took a piece of bread and sliced off an end of sausage. “I’ll bring down a wash basin for you to bathe, whenever you’re ready. Or you can bathe upstairs and I’ll wait outside.” I sat up at the thought of leaving the dingy cellar to clean up. “If – you don’t mind – yes, I would rather go upstairs.” He gave a curt nod. “I’ll show you where the sponges are. And I’ll start cleaning down here. Or I can wait outside, if you wish, and watch for any uninvited guests.” 218 I lowered my gaze, eyeing the plate of warm food. I never expected him to accommodate me so much after I ran off last night. Especially with the way I now looked. He had no idea what I had done or what monsters were chasing me. Yet he welcomed me into his home without demanding any explanation. “Thank you. But I don’t think they’ll be looking for me now.” “Hopefully not.” His eyes looked kind but wounded. “Are you all right, Helena?” I curled my lips shut. I wanted to tell someone what happened. What I had discovered about the wolves, whatever that was, exactly. I needed to learn what made those two bolts kill the wolves when the others failed. But Father Vestille was the last person I wanted to confess my activities to, let alone boast about them. “I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you for your hospitality. It’s very kind of you.” He seemed ready to say something, then shook his head slightly. “You can stay here if you wish. I’ll keep you hidden. My home will always be open to you, no matter where you go or what you do. I just want you to be safe.” “Thank you. I’ll consider that.” I hardly knew what to say. After I had rejected all of his hospitality, he still offered me a home. His home. Or at least, the secret longhouse hidden beneath it. My own underground refuge, for as long as I wanted. Somehow it seemed right to hide here. Despite its musty odor, it felt so comfortable and 219 familiar. As if I belonged here, where nothing could touch me. I studied the dusty rocking chair as Father Vestille leaned forward on the awkward stool to tear off some bread. “Who did you hide down here during the war?” He blinked in surprise. “I hid you.” I nearly choked on my bread. He leaned forward anxiously, but I held up a hand as I chewed and swallowed. “What?” “You and your parents, and your Grand’Mere. When foreigners started raiding the villages, they were hunting for soldiers. Like your father. This underground shelter was a secret that the former owner shared with me, for just such a purpose. We’ve all kept it secret ever since.” He shook his head, recalling troubled times. “Your father came home frantic, the last survivor of his regiment. Not certain whether to fight the invaders or protect your mother, who was with child – you. He decided, wisely, to protect his family. You were born down here, with your Grand’Mere serving as midwife. You all lived here nearly two years, while the invaders tried to secure territory up above. Your father snuck out at night on several occasions to wreak havoc on their equipment and supplies, then retreated back here to safety.” “Papa hid here and snuck out to battle the enemy at night?” “One successful ambush after another,” Father Vestille said. “He took great risks, but he always returned home safe to your mother, here.” Just like I did last night, I thought. 220 I stared back at the rocking chair, laden with years of dust. I tried to imagine Mama rocking an infant in it. Tried to imagine her wondering how long she would be confined to this underground prison, struggling to keep her child hidden. To keep me hidden. As she wondered if the invasion would ever end, and whether Papa would return that night, or leave her and Grand’Mere to raise me all alone. Father Vestille folded his hands over his mouth. “The invading forces never bothered me. I was only a priest, submitting to their rule. So I could keep you all safe.” He lowered his gaze. “That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. Your parents invited me here from Burgundy, and let me stay with them until I could find a place of my own. This place. I owe them a great deal.” I felt cobwebs lifting from my memories. “I remember a wide door opening in the ceiling,” I said. “I remember sunlight pouring in.” He smiled. “We all celebrated when the King’s soldiers arrived to secure order. We were free. Free to return to our separate homes. But we kept meeting every week at your home.” Until the wolf attacks, when you decided to spend your time visiting safer provinces, I thought. Still, it was clear my family owed him a great debt. I owed him a great debt. “I never knew that,” I said. He ate his bread and sausage while I broke off a chunk of cheese. We chewed in silence. When we finally finished, he gathered up the tray and moved to a far corner of the room, where a 221 ladder stood upright near the wall. It ended at the dusty ceiling. “Let me show you where the basin and sponges are. Then I’ll get some oats for your horse and start tidying up down here.” He moved the tray to one arm and started up the ladder. I stood, amazed. “This leads up to your home?” “Of course,” he said. He pounded with one fist against the ceiling and pushed open a door. Light poured in from above. I felt the same rush of memories from childhood, feelings of instant safety and freedom. Father Vestille slid the tray up onto the floor above, then brushed away clumps of dust from the opening. “It was designed well, to hide soldiers and refugees as well as weapons. If anyone attacked, there was another means of escape. However, I figured it would be best to enter through the ramp we used last night. I didn’t want to startle you. You can eat meals with me or down here. Or you can stay somewhere else and come here if you need refuge. Whatever you choose.” He ascended the ladder and stepped out of sight. I hesitated to follow him. He had invited me into his home many times, but I had never looked or smelled so foul. With my strange and wanton appearance, I expected him to deny he even knew me. I rose from the cot, feeling stiff pain throughout my body, especially my ankles and lower back. I didn’t realize how much last night’s ordeal took out of me until I tried to simply stand 222 up. Crimson went back to sleep on the floor. He must have felt the same exhaustion, or perhaps more. I climbed the ladder, stepping gingerly on bruises and blisters that stung the soles of my feet. I clutched the rung and grit my teeth. If I planned to continue this crusade, my body would have to adapt. The door in the ceiling opened onto a corner of Father Vestille’s front room, warm and free of dust. I breathed in clean air and felt my body relax. He had few furnishings, but they looked comfortable. Three cushioned chairs, a breakfast table, a reading table with a lantern and his Bible beside another leatherbound book, a broad round rug, some portraits of the Christ and of some friends, and a stoop leading up to the front door. The outer porch was all I had ever seen of this place. Who could imagine it hid such a refreshing home? I looked back at the wall of portraits, seeing one that looked familiar. I stepped forward and saw that it was my parents, with me as a child, only a few years old. Mama held me on her lap, unable to contain her smile. Papa sat beside her, strong and upright, lifting his stiff chin as if daring anyone to attack his family. I forced down emotions, refusing to let myself cry. Then I realized, he had no paintings of any other friends. He kept this portrait alone, alongside the portrait of the Christ. A picture of Mama and Papa and me from long ago, before I was scarred. I tightened my lips and stood taller. 223 Father Vestille noticed me staring at the portrait. “You were only four then,” he said. “That was painted by a young man who came through the village, a couple of years after the war. Your father paid to have it made and it was remarkable. He could tell I wanted it badly, but I would never ask. I still feel it should have been hanging in your home all these years, but he insisted I keep it. He told me they would see it often enough, every time they came over.” I felt a lump of shame in my throat. I had never even seen it. I turned back to the reading table, picking up the leatherbound book. “Is this a book of Latin translation or something?” He deftly extracted it from my hands, so suddenly and gracefully it felt like it had vanished into thin air. “No, this is nothing,” he said, sliding it beneath his Bible. “Just an old journal of personal notes.” I swallowed. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to be so nosy. I’ve just – I’ve never been here before.” “It’s all right, Helena. You have nothing to apologize for.” He pointed at a large oval washtub against the wall. A bucket was set beside it with a rag slung over its rim. “The washbasin is here. I’ll fetch some water to heat up and fill it for you. Should have it ready in less than an hour.” He pointed at the rear door. “My room is in the back, if you need more rest while you’re waiting.” “Father Vestille. My clothes are filthy. I can’t lie down on your bed.” 224 He didn’t look at me as he grabbed a bucket from the corner. “I can wash the bedsheets later. Right now, I’m caring for you.” “Don’t you need to know what happened? Where I went after the funeral?” He started toward the front door. “I’m sure you’ll tell me when you’re ready, if you wish to.” “Why did you ask if I went after the wolves last night?” “I heard them howling. Obviously, they were chasing you.” “But why did you hide me underground? You don’t mind me being here now. Why didn’t you take us straight into the house last night?” He stopped with the door half-open. Standing like a statue, he stared at the stoop in silence. Then he slowly closed the door and stepped down, setting the bucket on the floor. “Helena, sit down.” “I told you, I’m filthy. I can’t sit on these nice –.” “Helena, please,” he implored in a mournful tone. “I need to speak with you.” He sat in one cushioned chair. I sat in the one opposite him, struggling to ignore the mud and manure of my cloak staining its cushion. Father Vestille folded his hands and stared at the floorboards. “I hid you underground because – I thought others might be chasing you. Along with the wolves.” 225 I stared at his balding head. Wondering what secrets he held inside it. “You know something about these attacks.” He looked up, his eyes desperate and sad. “Helena. I don’t know what happened to you as a child. I don’t know what killed your parents and Suzette.” “Father Vestille, I think I –.” “— but I have my suspicions.” Blood surged through my cheeks like fire. “I’ve heard many rumors over the years. Of attacks on women and children in this area and other provinces. In Gevaudan and Dijon and several villages throughout France. Attacks by wolves.” My breath grew heavier. My heart beat harder. “And not ordinary wolves. Witnesses describe them as something larger than a wolf, but similar in appearance. The largest wolves are about five feet long, but these are more than six feet long, standing over four feet high.” I stifled an inward gasp. He was describing the size of the wolves I had fought last night. The size of the wolf that scarred me when I was seven. “People also claim that these wolves act strangely. Almost cunning in their approach, the way they avoid men and their weapons. Almost stealthy in their patience and strategy, attacking victims when they’re alone and most vulnerable. Some insist they have noticed these wolves waiting several nights for an opportunity to seize a 226 small child, the moment she ventured outside her home.” In my mind, I pictured Favreau’s farmhouse and the thinning ivory nightgown of his young daughter. I felt a shiver in my skin. “What are these creatures?” Father Vestille shook his head, looking helpless. “I have no idea. But there have been rumors of other activity in those same areas. Some people claim there is a cult that worships wolves, believing the animals to be superior to men in both power and cunning. This cult calls itself the Lycanthru.” He held my locked gaze. “Many believe the Lycanthru are responsible for these attacks.” I could hear my breath now. Feel my chest heaving up and down. “How?” He shook his head again. “I don’t know. Some say they capture wolves and practice witchcraft on them. They believe the Lycanthru have the power to transform these wolves into the creatures that attacked those women and children.” Every nerve of my body was on fire. “How do I find them?” “You don’t!” he barked. He struggled to calm himself, shaking. “Helena. I’m telling you this to help you understand. These men are practicing witches. They’re performing rituals on wolves to make them kill people.” I stifled my fear. “Like Mama and Papa? And Suzette and Francois?” He frowned. “Yes. And like you, if you keep after them. Do you understand?” 227 I stood to my feet. “Someone has to stop them, whatever they’re doing. Someone has to make this stop.” He rose with me. “But you are not that person, Helena.” “You don’t think I can face them? You’re wrong. You would know how wrong you were if you saw me last night. I killed two of them.” “Two of how many? There have been over a hundred attacks reported, just in the surrounding villages. Do you expect to hunt them all down?” He stopped himself. Then he took me by the shoulders. “Helena. I know you’ve suffered. I’ve suffered, too, though not as greatly. I lost your father and mother and your sweet sister. I don’t want to lose you, too.” I felt my cheek twitch, but I steadied my resolve. “I’ll see to it that you don’t.” “It’s not that simple, Helena.” He turned from me, wringing his hands. “What happens when they come after you? Were they chasing you when I found you?” I said nothing, but shuddered. “You’re dealing with something far more dangerous than you realize.” I bit my lip. “Maybe I am. But someone has to.” He hung his head, defeated. “I cannot tell you what to do. I can only beg you to stay away from those people. These attacks have been occurring for decades, and no one has yet found a way to stop them.” 228 I thought of the two crossbow bolts in my satchel bag, my senses on fire. “I might have found it.” He blinked and narrowed his eyes at me. “How, Helena?” “I’ll look into it further and let you know.” I knew better than to tell him anything more. He already had little faith in my abilities. What would he think of my report that two bolts had killed wolves when all of the other bolts failed, and I just needed to figure out why. “All right, Helena.” His eyebrows lifted in a shrug of surrender. He stood as if shouldering a heavy weight. “Please consider what I said. And don’t do anything foolish.” His warning had come far too late, but I said nothing. “Rest in my bed for a while. I’ll fetch water and heat the bath. You can make this your home, if you wish.” He frowned again. “You are – You’re the only one left of your family. I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Please stay safe.” I swallowed. “I will. I promise.” He nodded, pursing his lips. As though he accepted my vow but knew I wouldn’t give up my dangerous plans. He retrieved the bucket and moved to the front door, creaking it open to scan for intruders before stepping outside. I felt a strange emptiness in the silent house. Father Vestille was the last person I wanted in my life, especially now. But he might understand my loss better than anyone else. In an 229 odd way, he was the closest thing to a family I had left. I sighed, dismissing my grief. His hovel kept me warm and secure. That was all that mattered. If this Lycanthru cult was behind the attacks, they would never search for me in a priest’s home, let alone his secret underground retreat. I could no longer sleep in the loft at L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Not after attacking the wolves last night. Some villagers might expect me to seek help from Pierre, and that expectation could endanger him and his parents. I would have to avoid meeting him too often. After I returned there today, of course. 230 25. By late afternoon, I had bathed and eaten a little more. I even slept another few hours in Father Vestille’s underground retreat, which smelled much nicer once he finished his cleaning. After I woke, I cleaned and fed Crimson, who seemed to feel as fresh and alive as I did, eager to gallop again. As we pounded toward the blacksmith shop, a few villagers cast odd glances at my bright hood and burnt umber horse. They would surely 231 have gaped at my offending trousers as well, if they knew I was a girl. The odor of burning iron filled the inside of L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne. Pierre looked up from his smelting pot and quickly extinguished the flame, setting his tools aside. He met me with eyes full of panic. “Red! Where did you go? Where have you been all day? Father Vestille was searching for you for hours, and I’ve been –.” “He found me,” I said. “I’m –.” I stopped short, catching myself before I announced I was staying with Father Vestille. Pierre was the one person I could confide in. But to protect him and myself, I had to keep that retreat secret. From everyone. “What?” “I’m not sure where I’ll be staying now.” He looked wounded. “Red. You can stay here as long as you want.” “That’s not entirely safe. I appreciate the offer, and I may take advantage of it now and then. But your loft can’t be a permanent home. It will draw too much attention.” “From who? I don’t care what anyone in town thinks.” “Not from people in town.” “Red, what’s happened?” “I found them.” Color drained from his cheeks. “The wolves?” “And I fought them. About twelve of them.” 232 He glared at me, trembling slightly. He looked me up and down, apparently checking for cuts or missing limbs. “Are you – Are you all right? You – You got through it.” “Yes,” I said, sounding more annoyed than I should have. Pierre knew I was a better hunter than most men. But no one, man or woman, would likely survive an attack from a dozen wolves. If it weren’t for Father Vestille, I would be dead. I softened, touching his hand. “I’m fine, Pierre. Thank you for your concern, and your help. Everything you gave me.” He released an anxious sigh. “How did the blades work for you?” “Fine, Pierre,” I said. “They work just fine.” “And the new crossbow?” I lifted the repeating crossbow for him to see. “It worked perfectly. Twice. That’s why I need your help.” He took the crossbow and studied it with a quizzical expression. “It only fired twice?” “No. It fired thirteen bolts.” He blinked at me, looking even more amazed. “You missed?” Heat rose in my cheeks and I stuck my fists on my hips. “I sank every single bolt into those things.” “Oh,” he said, satisfied with the answer to one puzzle but still confounded by the remaining one. I calmed myself and realized he was complimenting me. He believed his own repeating 233 crossbow was more likely to fail than I was likely to miss. “Most of my shots would have killed a normal wolf. But these things kept coming. The bolts had no effect on them. Except for these two.” I held up the grimy bolts I had pulled from my satchel. He took them from me and squinted closely. “What’s so special about these two?” “That’s what I need you to find out. Do you make every bolt the same way?” “Yes,” he said. Then he seemed to recall something and looked a bit ashamed. “Although – the process is the same, but – we don’t always use the same material. You asked me to make you extra bolts, so I used the metal we had in supply. I had to mix in some other metal for some of them, to give you a few more.” “How many bolts did you make that way?” “Only two or three.” We gaped at one another. Tugging on his work gloves, Pierre grabbed a rag and dunked it into a steaming pot of water. He squeezed it out, then used it to wipe most of the blood and grime from each bolt. He took them to a smelting pot at the opposite end of his work table, adding some kindling to heat a flame beneath it. Then he held the bolts over it, melting them slowly. After a full minute, I watched a single drip fall into the pot. I stepped aside to sit on a bench. This would take some time. Beyond the furnace, the rear door of Pierre’s house opened. Monsieur Leóne came out, marching straight across the room. “Pierre, I need 234 you to finish those stokers for Monsieur Denue by Friday.” Pierre turned on his heel to stand at attention. “Yes, sir.” Monsieur Leóne studied his son a moment, then noticed me sitting quietly in the corner. “Helena? What are you –?” He blinked hard at my legs. I broke the silence. “I came to ask Pierre for some help. Something’s wrong with my bolts.” He seemed to be struggling for words. I crossed my legs and tried to pull the outer edges of my cloak over them. It didn’t help. He seemed just as perplexed, just as offended. “Helena …” He started to speak, wrinkled his brows some more, and shut his mouth. He tried again. “Helena, I – I’m so sorry for your loss. Your mother and Suzette, they were wonderful people.” I stared back, feeling numb. “Thank you.” He couldn’t tear his eyes away from my masculine garb. “Do you – need anything? Food or – clothes?” “No, thank you. I’m well taken care of.” He forced his mouth to close. Then at last, he turned and walked away, but stopped to address his son. “Pierre, I need to pick up some more iron. The miners finally broke through and found a rich supply, so we won’t run short again. I’ll return in two hours.” He glanced sideways at me, then turned back to Pierre. “Can you handle everything while I’m away?” “Of course, Papa.” 235 Monsieur Leóne gave a curt nod, blinked at me twice more, then left through the door to their home. Pierre looked irritated. “First time he’s ever asked me if I can handle the shop by myself. I usually do when he’s away.” “I don’t think he approves of my wardrobe,” I said flatly. Pierre shrugged. “Well – it’s a little different.” I looked away, feeling even more isolated. But I no longer cared what Monsieur Leóne thought of me. Or what anyone else thought. Pierre studied the falling drips of metal. “Nothing unusual so far. Regular iron, like we always use. Some lead, though, showing here. All right, so this one had some other metal mixed in. But I can’t see how that would matter, when – wait – all right, some copper. Traces of silver …” Blood surged through my shoulders. As though I was meant to pay attention to that detail. As though I had been given the answer. Silver. Francois said his ax blade was made of silver. His blade only grazed the wolf, but had killed it instantly. “Try the other one,” I said. He narrowed his eyes at me, confused. “I haven’t finished studying this one.” “It’s enough. Melt the other one.” He frowned, but set his tools and the first bolt aside. Within a few minutes, he found what I expected him to find. 236 “– some lead in this one, too – Some traces of silver. Must have just poured everything in at once. Nothing else yet, but –.” “It’s silver,” I said. “What?” “Silver. That’s what kills them.” “Red, that makes no sense. A silver bolt couldn’t hurt a wolf any more than an ordinary bolt.” “You should tell them that.” “But how’s that possible?” “I don’t know. But these bolts killed them, and so did Francois Revelier’s silver ax. Killed it easily, just like the two I shot last night. That must be the difference.” “Red, silver isn’t any kind of poison.” “It might be to them.” He shrugged again. “All right. How can we know for sure?” I sat rigid on the bench and stiffened my lip. “Only one way. I’ll have to start using silver bolts.” “You’re going after them again?” “Yes. But this time, I’ll be better armed.” “Red, if you’re wrong, they’ll kill you!” “They’ll kill us all, anyway,” I said hotly. “That’s what no one seems willing to grasp. They’re not going to stop. They’ll keep coming. They’ll keep getting stronger and more numerous and killing everyone they feel like killing. We can die trying to stop them or sit at home and wait for them to come. I’m not waiting.” “But – silver? That’s impossible, Red.” 237 “So are these wolves, over six feet long and able to …” He waited for me to finish. “Able to what?” I almost said they could talk and stand upright. Something I never shared with anyone outside my family, not even Pierre. At least, not after the week of the attack, after seeing the confused faces of Father Vestille and Francois when I told them what happened. I couldn’t bear to receive that same look from Pierre. “… able to organize themselves to attack in large numbers,” I finished. “They staked out that pig farmer’s house to get at his daughter.” “What makes you think that?” “There were plenty of wolves on hand last night to attack. Yet for the last two weeks, they only took one pig at a time. They didn’t care about the pigs. They only wanted to draw out the farmer and his little girl. Once she came outside, the wolves showed up in full force.” “But why would wolves attack a little girl when they could go after a whole herd of pigs?” I thought of Father Vestille’s story about the Lycanthru, practicing witchcraft on wolves. “They’re not wolves. They’re some other sort of creatures, under some kind of spell. I’ll need silver bolts. My blades and other weapons need to be silver, too. Even my grappling hook, just in case.” Pierre wrinkled his brow. “We don’t have that much silver to spare, Red. How much does it take?” 238 I peered into the smelting pot at the sparse drops of melted silver. “How much was in those bolts?” “Barely a trace.” “Then that’s all I need. Just a little on the tip of each bolt and the sharp edges of each blade.” Pierre rubbed the back of his neck. “Red, suppose you’re right. Suppose this will kill them. They’re not likely to show up at that farm again. How will you even find them?” I thought of Touraine, telling me about the men who delighted in reports of wolf attacks. Men who might belong to the Lycanthru. “I have an idea where to start.” 239 26. A few hours later, after I ate some bread and pork prepared by Pierre and rested a little more in his loft, I rode toward La Maison de Touraine. Pierre had outfitted all of my weapons while I slept, gilding each new bolt and knife edge with silver. He said his father would be furious to learn he had melted down other customers’ works to make new bolts for me, putting their orders further behind. But he planned to tell him he found some imperfections and needed extra time to finish. I thanked him for it. 240 It was near nightfall. Villagers started to tug their cloaks about their shoulders as they passed by in the street. Many of them stared at me with a fresh sense of surprise. Instead of wrinkling their noses at me, they stopped in their tracks and followed my movements, almost in a sense of wonder. As though it had suddenly become admirable to wear a giant red cloak. I rode up to the hitching post at La Maison and left Crimson to stand beside it. I patted his neck. He had slept well at Father Vestille’s last night and gotten more water and oats from Pierre. He seemed fit and ready for whatever might come tonight. I pushed through the thick doors of the tavern. Raucous conversations stopped. I scanned the room. Every eye fell on me. I stood at the door, uncertain what to do. Were they staring at my scars? At the red hood? I stepped forward, listening to my own slow boot steps on the floorboards as I approached the bar counter. People began to murmur and resume their excited conversations, now strangely hushed. Were they talking about me? At the bar, Touraine wiped the counter where a man had just spilled his beer. As I drew near, the gaping man slid off his stool, filling my face with his alcohol breath. He continued to stare as he turned in a circle and backed away, forgetting the rest of his drink on the counter. “So,” Touraine said quietly. “You’ve returned.” 241 “I seem to be popular this evening.” His broad shoulders heaved and sighed. “Yes, you are. You went to Favreau’s farm last night.” It was not a question. “I might have.” “You fought five or six large wolves there, killed two of them. They found the bodies this morning.” “There were about a dozen, actually. They chased me into the –.” “You’re him, aren’t you?” interrupted a well-dressed man. His large elbow came to rest on the far end of the counter. His voice was smooth, almost mocking. “You’re that red rider. The one who fought all the wolves at that farmhouse.” I turned slowly toward him, keeping my head down, saying nothing. It seemed prudent to let him think I was a man. Even more prudent when I took a good look at him out of the corner of my eye. Tall and strong, with a broad black moustache. He held his drink at his side, grinning as if he was somehow challenging me. Not doubting me, but wanting to test my abilities. “Move along, Brocard,” Touraine said. “Those are just rumors. How could one man take on a pack of wolves by himself?” The man ignored Touraine and didn’t budge. He sipped his drink, studying me. “Those wolves. They’re dangerous, you know. You’re lucky to be alive.” His face lit up like the devil, or something worse. As if he could picture the wolves tearing me apart. “I’m Jean Paul Brocard. I farm 242 cattle and do some business in the village. I trade livestock, horses, weapons, tools. Anything a man might need.” He raised his eyebrows with an unconvincing show of friendliness. “Perhaps I could outfit you some day, Monsieur. A man who fights off a whole pack of wolves will surely need help now and again. Extra food for your horse. Extra bolts for that crossbow.” Touraine cleared his throat, looking nervous. “I really don’t think the man’s interested, Brocard.” The smiling man edged closer along the bar counter. “You might discover I’m a good man to have on your side, Monsieur. You need someone you can count on, to help you survive. When the odds are overwhelming.” He slid his drink along ahead of him, stopping it near me. He sat on the stool beside mine and leaned forward, folding his fists as he tried to look beneath my hood. “Because those wolves will come looking for you, you know. All of them. And they’ll find you. And tear you into small pieces. Who will help you then?” I stood and raised my crossbow to his face. Every conversation halted again as Brocard lifted his chin. His Adam’s apple swallowed hard. Then he smiled wider, as if to cover his anxiety. I understood, since I had drawn my crossbow in order to keep him from seeing my shoulders trembling. I focused on steadying the weapon, the way Papa had taught me to do when we were hunting, to push aside my fear. Brocard lifted his palms in gracious surrender. I allowed him to take a step back. “I see 243 it is a ‘No’ for now,” he said. “We’ll talk again another time, Monsieur.” He continued to back away, hands raised as he grinned. I turned toward the watching crowd. They all kept silent. A few of them turned away as I met their gaze. “Yes, you’re popular all right,” Touraine said. “Be glad I’m not telling anyone you’re a girl. A strange young girl at that, dressing like a man and fighting wolves in the dead of night. They’d never leave you alone.” I lowered my crossbow, concealing it beneath my cloak. “Am I really that strange?” He pursed his lips. “Have you seen a mirror lately?” “But you meet all sorts of people here. Even women. Am I actually the strangest girl you’ve ever met?” He considered for a moment. “Ever?” I nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, you are. Just watch yourself. Men like Brocard are charming enough, but he’s part of a dangerous crowd.” I resumed my place on the stool. “Dangerous, how?” “Excuse me, Monsieur.” I flinched at the gruff voice. A tall man marched straight at me. He wore the broad blue cloak of the village police. “I hear you were involved in an incident at Monsieur Favreau’s farm last night.” I kept my head down a little, hiding beneath the hood as best I could while I studied him. He looked strong and severe, with inky black 244 hair beneath his broad-brimmed hat. He squinted at me with narrow eyes. Eyes that shone blue-gray.",

      "content": "I stiffened, my blood racing through my veins. The same blue-gray eyes of the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me scarred. The same eyes of the wolf that Pierre and I met in the dark tunnel. What in God’s name did it mean? “I’m Lieutenant-General Vigo Sharrad,” he said, his words coming to me in a fog. “It’s my job to protect the people of La Rue Sauvage. And their farmland.” “I think someone’s been spreading rumors, Monsieur Sharrad,” Touraine said casually. Sharrad jutted his broad chin at Touraine, as if threatening to stretch forth and bite him. “And who’s spreading those rumors, do you think?” Touraine shrugged. “I don’t know. But I can’t imagine anyone fighting off a pack of wolves on their own. Let alone this – person wearing a bright red cloak. Can you?” “I can imagine a number of things.” Sharrad glared back at me. “I expect you’ve got a wild imagination, too, don’t you, Monsieur?” “Monsieur,” Touraine broke in again, leaning on the counter with a smile. “This gentleman’s just here for a drink. Maybe some people don’t like how he looks. Maybe they’re jealous of his cloak. So they’re making up stories about him. He hasn’t really done anything, has he?” 245 Sharrad’s eyes burned into me. I kept my head lowered, but kept watching him from the shroud of my large hood. Watching his eyes. “Not yet,” Sharrad said. “But I’ve heard reports, and I’ll be watching you, Monsieur. If I hear of any more unprovoked attacks on wolves or other animals, you’ll see me again.” “But, Monsieur,” Touraine continued. “If someone’s killed some of the wolves that are attacking people, that would be good, wouldn’t it?” Sharrad faced him with his fists on his hips. “When I need a tavern keeper to help me keep order in the village, you’ll be the first man I call on. Until then, keep quiet and bring me and my friends another round.” “Of course. Sorry, Monsieur. Be there in a moment.” Sharrad cast another glare in my direction. “You keep that crossbow put away while you’re indoors, understand?” I gave a slow deliberate nod. Sharrad regarded me another moment before striding away to his table. I shivered as I watched him go. I couldn’t have seen what I thought I did. It was impossible. But I couldn’t deny it. Those shining eyes were unforgettable. I would have to watch Lieutenant-General Sharrad closely until I could reason it out. Touraine glanced in Sharrad’s direction. “Try not to get yourself arrested. Or killed. Seems you’re making the wrong people angry. Of course, now that you’ve killed a couple of giant wolves, you probably think you can handle anything.” 246 “Tell me about those men. The ones who enjoy hearing about wolf attacks.” He nodded back at Lieutenant-General Sharrad before turning to line up several mugs on a tray. “He’s one of them. So is Brocard. They come in here with their friends every time there’s an attack. Someone from their group is usually the first to report it.” He wrinkled his brow. “Matter of fact, I never knew you used a crossbow, ‘til Brocard offered you more bolts.” “I thought Favreau told everyone that.” Touraine shook his head as he filled each mug in turn. “No one’s seen Favreau. His brothers found his stray pigs and rounded up most of them. But Favreau wouldn’t come out or let his daughter out, even when they beat on his door. Kept telling everyone to go away.” I felt an inner chill. “So how did anyone know about the wolf attack last night? How could anyone know I was there?” Touraine leaned over the counter and spoke in a lower tone. “Be careful. Someone knows what you did, and they’re spreading the word.” “Someone who was there,” I said. “Someone like Sharrad and his friends.” He seemed to consider this as he resumed filling the mugs. “Likely.” “So am I some kind of pariah now?” “Maybe. No one’s sure what to make of it. Someone attacking wolves late at night on a farm and killing two of them. Some think you’re a hero. Most of them didn’t believe you existed.” He 247 surveyed the room of hushed murmurs. “Of course, they do now.” I turned to view Sharrad and his table. The murmur of the crowd hushed as I faced them. Some men watched my every move, perhaps fearing I might draw my crossbow again. Sharrad’s cold eyes continued to focus on me. Beside him, Brocard raised his mug toward me with a smile. None of the other seven men at their table were smiling. They stared at me or looked over their shoulder, scowling and whispering at one another’s ear. They were all dressed differently, representing different jobs, different ages, different tastes. Yet they shared the same vicious scowl. I wouldn’t trust myself alone in a room with any of them. “How often are those men in here?” “Every night on the weekends,” Touraine said. “Either that crowd or some of the others.” “There are more?” “Plenty more. A few dozen, I’d expect. All different walks of life. Some farmers, some carpenters, merchants, woodcutters, coopers, blacksmiths. Some of them are very well off, some are barely managing. Not sure what they’ve all got in common. Except maybe a cruel sense of humor.” He shook his head again. “I’d stay away from them, if I were you.” I studied the surly gang across the room as they eyed me with contempt. “Yes,” I said. “That would be wise.” 248 27. It was near midnight before Sharrad and his associates left the tavern. I spied on them from a dark alley, feeling the evening’s chill, as Crimson waited behind me in quiet obedience. They seemed in good spirits now, shoving playfully at one another and making threatening growls, like rough-spirited children. Like Jacque Denue and his companions. Hairs rose on my skin. I could see what Touraine meant about avoiding these men. I didn’t 249 want to go anywhere near them. But I had to know how they were connected with the wolves. They mounted their horses and trotted off toward the woods. Brocard, still utterly pleased with himself, led the way with a lantern held aloft. I allowed them time to gain some distance, then climbed onto Crimson’s saddle and rode after them, following their distant light. About ten minutes later, Brocard and the others entered a large clearing on the outskirts of a sprawling farm. I tugged gently on Crimson’s reins, keeping us shrouded and still in the forest. The men rode ahead in full view, toward the large barn at the center of the pasture. Whoever owned this land seemed well-off. A wheat field spread for several acres beyond the grove of trees that hid the barn and silo. Yet there was no house connected with the barn, so the owner could afford to hire out farmers while he sat at home raking in profits. Sharrad and the others dismounted and glanced about, looking over their shoulders. Crimson kept perfectly still for me in the shadows. Once they were satisfied, Brocard raised his torch higher and led the way to the barn. He tugged open the front door. More torches blazed within, where several other men had gathered. I couldn’t see any particular person, only a small crowd. As a few of the men led their horses around back, Brocard and the others went inside, casting 250 final glances over their shoulders before they shut the door. Something felt wrong, unsettling me like a snake burrowing under my skin. I prodded Crimson forward by cautious steps into the shadowy grove, surveying the grounds to make sure no other men approached. A noise rose within the barn, like a unified cheer, or a collective moan from a herd of beasts. Crimson slowed his pace, and I couldn’t blame him. I felt a crawling chill in the air. Like something small and devilish laughing in the wind. We edged forward to the side of the barn. I dismounted and drew Crimson to stand close to the wall. The din inside grew louder and clearly human, almost musical in its unison. I crept to the front door and searched for a discreet way to enter. Up above, beams of light broke through the wall, revealing the loading entrance for stockpiling hay. I withdrew Pierre’s grappling hook and slid back the lever, letting its prongs spring out. I squinted, spotting a small triangular hole above the loading door where the wood had worn through. I swung the steel hook in circles, then let it fly. It caught the hole above the door and I tugged on it, feeling it embed itself in the wood. I paused, listening for any sudden movement, then started up the wall. Thankfully, I only had a few steps to climb to the loft. I righted myself and stepped carefully along the slim ledge as the strange rhythm grew louder within. I tugged the prongs free to return the hook to my belt and cracked the door open. 251 Hay and dust trickled down from the pile that had been shoved against it. I wrinkled my nose at the moldy straw that had been pushed to the outer edges by fresh hay. I spread the hay apart with cautious fingers, as if wading through weeds in a pond. The noise beyond the hay pile grew louder and stronger, the chant drumming through my entire body as I pushed deeper inside. Something reeked of sulfur, permeating the inside of the barn. Finally, I broke through part of the hay to peer through a giant square hole in the center of the loft. A large throng of men stood in formation on the floor below, dressed in black hooded robes and chanting in a strange language that sounded like Latin. Towering torches burned at either end of the ceremony. One robed man stood on a platform between two short pedestals, his arms raised to the assembly. Each hood depicted a grinning wolf, making them all look like black wolves with the robed bodies of men. Behind the leader, a large vat bubbled up something foul, the offensive sulfur odor I had detected. The hypnotic chant continued as two men each brought an animal carcass toward the leader. They laid both corpses on a pedestal, bowed to the leader, and backed away to resume their positions. They were two dead wolves. I shuddered. I had found the Lycanthru. Something shuffled nearby. I noticed four robed men standing on either side of me, looking down on the ceremony from separate corners of the loft. I steadied my breathing and didn’t move. 252 The leader produced a curved dagger and cut away a section of one wolf’s back. He held up the small rectangular pelt, showing it to the crowd as the chanting slowed. Then he wrapped it around the back of his neck, wearing it like a priest’s collar. As he did so, the other men produced similar wolf pelts and placed them around the backs of their own necks. Then the leader pointed straight up. Was he pointing at me? I held my breath. No one reacted to my presence. Instead, they craned their necks toward a skylight cut into the roof, which shed moonlight on each of them. The leader lifted his arms, welcoming the moon’s rays the way someone might welcome the sun’s warmth after a rainstorm. The others followed suit, raising their hands to the moon as if praising it. Then they produced small flasks from within their robes. The leader took his to the bubbling vat behind him. He lifted a large iron ladle from the vat, filled it with the foul goldenrod liquid, and poured it into his vial with a doctor’s precision. It bubbled a little more as he stirred the vat with his ladle, refreshing the sulfur stench in the air. He extended his arm to the other hooded figures. They stepped forward, one by one, to have him fill their own flasks. When everyone had taken from the vat, they returned to their positions to face the man on the platform. Then each one drew back his hood. I leaned forward and squinted at the leader. 253 And stared at the handsome features and piercing eyes of Duke Leopold Laurent. Duke Laurent, Papa’s influential friend. The man who bent down to smile at me after Jacque Denue’s friends attacked me, to ask if I was all right. The man who held a banquet to honor Francois, for his bravery in killing the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie. A banquet from which Francois went home drunk, escorted by the Duke’s men, to be devoured by a pack of wolves that same night. As if by coincidence. Or by design. Duke Laurent, who made an appearance at every funeral of every person killed by the wolves. Who railed against the King for ignoring his letters, in which he begged the court to send soldiers to rescue us. Letters he never truly sent. Laurent. I clenched my jaw and tensed my shoulders to keep from shaking the surrounding straw. Laurent spread his arms to the crowd. “My brothers. I know you have concerns about the men we lost last night, and the red-cloaked rider who killed them. I assure you, we will find him, whoever he is, and make him suffer. As to how he did it, I have sent word to the Prime, and I will let you know his conclusions once I receive them. You have my word.” I bit my lip, seething. His word. “Meanwhile, I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty has accepted my invitation.” This brought a cheerful murmur of approval and a few joyful shouts. Laurent waved down their 254 excitement with his hands. “So do not be distracted by last night’s incident. It is of little consequence, and in another month, will amount to nothing. So let us celebrate these fresh kills from our two newest initiates, and the strength they will soon share with us. Not to mention sharing in our glorious destiny. Soon all of our patience will be rewarded. Let us drink to that.” A few men laughed. Duke Laurent held up his flask with two hands, as if it was a precious infant. The other men followed suit. Laurent tipped his head back and they all drank. He winced as if it tasted bitter, but then licked his lips to savor it, like a drunkard sucking down stale alcohol solely for its effect. He stepped forward to stand directly beneath the skylight. The moon shone on his face as he closed his eyes with a look of rapture. He shed the black robe from his shoulders, revealing that he was completely naked. I nearly gasped, but kept quiet in spite of my shock. Then Duke Laurent’s face began to change. His strange grin pulled back at the corners of his mouth and somehow kept pulling, widening his lips. At the same time, his ears seemed to stretch away from his jaws, and moved impossibly up toward the top of his head. His nose grew larger, lengthening like that of a dog and extending over his chest. Gray hair sprouted from his cheeks, forehead and chest as he hunched forward. He fell to his hands and knees and I saw a bushy tail grow and lift from behind his back. His arms and legs narrowed while his hands and feet thickened and 255 grew into animal paws. He crouched on the floor of the barn and opened his fiery eyes, grinning again to display canine fangs. Laurent had become one of the six-foot wolves I fought at Favreau’s farm. The Lycanthru weren’t simply worshiping wolves. They were the wolves! 256 28. Seeing Duke Laurent transform into a wolf from my secret overhead perch, I inhaled with a sudden squeak, unable to stop myself. The four robed men standing at different corners of the hayloft turned sharp eyes on me. The nearest one clawed through the hay and seized my wrist. Before I could think, he yanked me from my hiding place for all to see. Straw and dust fell from my cloak like a rainshower. “It’s him!” he shouted. “It’s the red rider!” 257 He tugged me toward himself again as Laurent – in his horrid wolf-form – gaped up at us with bulging eyes. Others also turned toward us, while the other men in the hayloft ran at me. I kicked at my captor’s shin and he groaned, clutching his knee. I grabbed a pitchfork set against the wall and turned it on another man as he rushed at me, thrusting its tines at him twice. He backed away and lost his balance, falling from the loft onto the crowd below. The other two paused before continuing toward me. I couldn’t fend them both off at once. I turned back toward the hay pile where I had hidden. I shoved at it with the pitchfork, forcing the heavy pile out the loading door. I pushed myself out into the cool night air, the thick clumps of hay beneath me. I landed hard on the cushion of hay and rolled onto the grass, my side aching from the impact. Thankfully, the previous night’s rain had softened the ground enough to ease my fall. I whistled for Crimson as angry shouts grew within the barn, and the cultists rushed toward the front door. Crimson galloped straight at me, as if the barn’s rising chaos helped him to sense my need. I stood and grabbed the horn of his saddle, letting his momentum propel me up onto him as the door flew open and the Lycanthru poured out. I glanced back as we charged for the trees. The men stood outside the barn, gulping down liquid from their flasks and removing their black robes. I barely glimpsed their naked bodies crouching low to the ground and changing like 258 Duke Laurent did. Becoming an army of enormous wolves that bounded after me with nerve-rattling snarls. We raced deep into the forest. I drove Crimson harder, pounding past dark pine trees. The welcome cover of branches and leaves gave little comfort, since the Lycanthru wolves would know the terrain as well as I did. Hearing sharp growls, I turned to see three wolves closing in. I leaned against Crimson, having no way to fire the repeating crossbow with one hand while riding. Instead, I drew my father’s crossbow, already cocked. Slow and steady, keeping a sure grip as we galloped on. I took aim at the tan wolf nearing Crimson’s heels and fired, praying I was right about the silver. The bolt struck his flank, behind his head. A clumsy shot. Yet he fell to the ground with wide-eyed surprise. The other two wolves scrambled past him. One glanced back at the dead wolf twice, seeming confused that the creature didn’t rise. So much for my doubts. I had just killed a man. A man who could transform himself into a wolf. My fist clenched the reins tighter. The other two wolves quickened their pace. I leaned forward in the saddle to draw another bolt from my satchel bag. I loaded it and carefully lowered the crossbow’s strap to my right stirrup, my body in rhythm with Crimson’s stride. After looping the strap under my boot, I yanked up on it 259 to cock the bow. I turned as a wolf opened its jaws to nip at Crimson’s hind leg. I fired straight into its skull and it slumped to the ground. The third wolf watched its companion collapse, and his rushing gait faltered for a moment. I re-loaded and cocked the crossbow as I glimpsed more wolves, perhaps eight of them, approaching from the distant fog behind me. I shot the third wolf in his neck and he spun to the mud. They would reach me in less than a minute. I could never hold them off with my few remaining bolts. I pushed Crimson harder, clinging to him as we surged forward, heading for who-knew-where. I had to find an escape, somewhere. Anywhere. Anywhere to hide from these beasts that were once men! Father Vestille was right about how dangerous the Lycanthru were, just as Pierre was right about my hood, now a bright red flag drawing the wolves straight toward me. A sudden inspiration struck me. I slid Papa’s crossbow back into place behind the saddle and grabbed the repeating crossbow, slinging its strap over my shoulder. Then I untied my cloak with one hand. The wind blew the hood wide as I pulled it against Crimson’s neck and secured it to the reins. I pushed the flapping cloak from my face and looped the crossbow strap over my neck, then gripped the reins in my left hand as I drew my grappling hook. I flicked its prongs open and let the hook dangle at my hip. 260 I spotted a thick tree limb, the kind I needed, and swung the hook toward its base. It looped under the branch and locked in place as I gave Crimson a final prod and a shout. Then I lifted my heels and held tight to the rope, tugging myself out of the stirrups. I curved up under the limb as Crimson fled beneath me. He paused and glanced back, but I shouted again for him to keep going. He obeyed, confused, but slowed to a trot, refusing to stray too far as I scrambled up the rope. We had gained enough distance that the wolves wouldn’t see me climbing in the dark fog. At least, I hoped they wouldn’t. I hoisted myself onto the limb, straining to wrap my leg around it. I straddled the branch in time to see the wolves approaching. They stared straight ahead, focused on Crimson and the flapping cloak. I slid the repeating crossbow strap off my shoulder and took aim. Pierre had melted down enough material to load it with ten bolts, all tipped with silver. I fired at the three closest wolves as they rushed toward my tree, plugging each one. They dropped to the ground and lay silent. The silver worked. I fired at two more oncoming wolves, who broke their stride to view their fallen companions. Once struck, they lay a few feet past them in a heap. The other wolves slowed their rush. Some stopped altogether and hunched, twisting their necks toward the surrounding trees. I fired at the two in front, dropping them where they stood. 261 The rear wolves backed up a few paces. Some turned and fled. An auburn wolf growled back at them. “Cowards!” he shouted in a guttural voice. My blood ran cold. It was true, what I heard as a child. The wolves could speak. Men who could turn into wolves, but still think and speak like men. And they had organized themselves into a small army to attack the people of La Rue Sauvage. To attack families and their children. Why? I dismissed my questions for the moment. I had three bolts left. More than a dozen wolves remained below. If I took out their leader – the auburn wolf shouting at the ones who fled – then the others might back down. He still faced them while the other wolves paused in the clearing, shifting from side to side and looking uncertainly at one another. I took aim at his head, just below the pointed ear. He charged back toward the other wolves as I fired. “Come bac–!” he growled as my bolt sank into the tree trunk behind him. The wolves froze. I trembled, trying not to give away my position. Two bolts left. “There!” the auburn wolf snarled. “He’s up there!” The others padded a few steps back. Perhaps to get a better angle. Perhaps out of genuine fear. I focused on the auburn wolf but he bounded away before I could fire again, toward the 262 wolves that escaped. I puzzled over that while the rest of the pack shifted back and forth in the muddy ground. I worked to slow my breathing. Where had the auburn wolf gone? Had he run off to gather reinforcements from the barn? I couldn’t last long against them all, and I couldn’t wait them out until daybreak. I had to use every small advantage I had. Such as the fact that wolves couldn’t climb trees. Something snarled and rushed from behind the other wolves, who parted to make way for it. The auburn wolf charged between them, sprinting madly at the tree trunk where my bolt had embedded itself. He leaped at the tree and bounded off it to jump higher at another tree near me. He struck that trunk and sprang from it, launching himself at me like a flying nightmare, his jaws wide. I noted that normal wolves can’t climb trees, while I fired as a reflex, sinking my last two bolts into the auburn wolf’s mouth and gut. The beast spun backward in mid-air and twirled to the ground. It hit the earth like a sack of potatoes and lay dead. No bolts left. The others stared at the fallen animal and glanced at one another, shifting their paws. But they didn’t leave. Some fixed their eyes on the auburn wolf. Others backed away, ready to run. A few growled up at me. I turned toward a shuffling sound farther up the path, as the wolves also turned. Between the leaves, over the bushes, I could see Crimson’s 263 head as he trotted back and forth. He had insisted on staying close. I whistled for him. Time to escape, if we could. The wolves glanced in all directions. Crimson bounded through the trees, the red cloak wafting behind him like a soldier’s flag. The wolves backed away. “There are two of them!” one snarled. “Run!” growled another. Half the pack turned and sprinted away as I watched, amazed. It wasn’t just Crimson that startled them. They withdrew at the sight of my hooded cloak. The remaining wolves lost their courage and ran as Crimson charged at them. Ran from the sight of my red hood. I swallowed, releasing a hard breath. I shimmied down the rope as Crimson drew near, then jumped onto his saddle and kicked at him, leaving the grappling hook behind. I could retrieve it tomorrow. Or Pierre could make me another one. We galloped toward Father Vestille’s hovel, kicking up mud and leaves, Crimson’s hooves pounding with the rhythm of my heart. I steadied my heartbeat, gathering my thoughts. Everything had suddenly become clear, in one horrifying night. One horrifying hour. The wolves spoke. I had not imagined it. The wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie had spoken to unsettle me. He never expected me to survive and expose his strange ability. The Lycanthru were transforming themselves into wolves to attack people, led by Duke Laurent. 264 But I had discovered their weakness. The slightest touch of silver killed them. They now feared me. Feared my red hood. I thanked the Lord for revealing everything to me, my senses surging with relief and rage as we rushed through the frigid night. Everything became so clear. I could stop them. I could kill them all. 265 266 267 MY WAR 268 269 29. We emerged from the seclusion of the forest pines and trotted into the clearing where Father Vestille’s hovel sat. Nestled deep in the woods, his home was easy to reach and easy to maneuver from. Riding all the way into the village was out of the question, now that I knew the Lycanthru’s secrets. They would hunt me down. I could never use Pierre’s loft again. I tried to settle my racing heart. I had found the Lycanthru. And discovered Duke Laurent leading them. I still saw the image of his face 270 beneath that monstrous wolf-hood, standing before the cult that was terrorizing the province. Still saw Laurent and the other men drink that foul sulfurous liquid and transform themselves into enormous wolves. I shook off my fears. Silver would destroy them. I could destroy them. I had to keep my courage. More important, I had to keep myself hidden so I could rest. No one could know that I had anything to do with Father Vestille anymore. Or all of our lives would be forfeit. I led Crimson to the stable behind the stone hovel and surveyed the area for any witnesses. Then I kicked aside straw and lifted the secret door to Father Vestille’s underground sanctuary. I checked again for any sign of movement from the surrounding trees, then led Crimson down the ramp. He could fill up on oats and bed down for the night. I lit a candle and found the underground room much cleaner. No more cobwebs or dust clouds, and only a faint lingering odor of mold. Father Vestille must have spent a good part of his day making this place into a home. I swallowed. Could I ever again have a place to call home? Yet Father Vestille did his best to provide one, without even knowing whether I would return. I stepped back up the ramp to pull the top door shut, then got Crimson settled. Once he lay on the straw pile – much larger and fresher than last night – and closed his eyes, I climbed up the ladder and knocked on the trap door. I heard Father Vestille’s muffled voice and some quick shuffling overhead. 271 I was growing so accustomed to this night life, the life of a nocturnal beast, that I had forgotten normal people still retired to their beds well before midnight. “Helena?” Father Vestille called in a harsh whisper from above as he creaked across the floorboards. I pushed the door up and climbed into the warm candlelight of his front room. He stood there in his nightshirt, holding the candle on its tray. His anxious eyes were bloodshot. “I’m here,” I said. “Crimson’s settled for the night.” I stepped up into the room and eased the door shut. He deserved far more explanation of my activities, but I acted as though I had said all that was necessary. I couldn’t expect him to understand. He accepted it, clearing his throat. “Do you – Have you had anything to eat?” My pride urged me to lie and say I didn’t need anything. But my more practical stomach growled. “I’ll get you some bread,” Father Vestille said. “I still have some cheese and lamb from tonight’s supper. I hoped you might return.” He shuffled away to his table. I followed slowly as he unwrapped the remains of bread from a cloth in a round basket, then unwrapped some cold lamb and hunks of cheese from another platter. He looked at me, somewhat abashed. “I can light the fire again to heat this up.” 272 I shook my head. I didn’t want him to have to do anything more. Nor would it be wise to send up chimney smoke from his hovel after midnight, with the Lycanthru searching for me. I shuddered and clutched my shoulders. “It’s fine. Thank you.” I grabbed the meat and tore off a chunk with my teeth. I had not eaten for hours and the excitement in the forest only made me more ravenous. I was well into my second bite when I noticed Father Vestille staring at me with concern. I realized I had failed to give thanks again. I stopped chewing in mid-stride and bowed my head to thank the Lord for the food. For this place. For my life. Whatever might be left of it. I opened my eyes to find him still staring. Perhaps he was less worried about my prayers than for my half-starved condition. “Can I get you anything else? Do you need to bathe again? I can wait out here, or outside if you like.” I shook my head and chewed. I had to discuss tonight’s events with someone, and quickly. Even if it had to be Father Vestille. Before it was too late. “Father Vestille,” I began, then finished chewing. “… Something happened tonight.” He stood listening. Then he turned and pulled up a stool to sit before me. I sat in the chair by his table. It felt good to sit. To do something normal and safe. To imagine I could be safe again someday. I swallowed and lowered my eyes. “I saw them. The Lycanthru. I saw them all.” 273 His voice rose in a panic as he gripped my shoulders. “Helena. Are you all right?” I nodded. I didn’t shake him off. It felt good to be held, the closest thing to an embrace that I would experience for some time. My entire life had changed in a few days. In one terrifying night. I could never be the same person again. I could never again enjoy a feeling of safety or home or family. “There were several men, wearing robes. With images of wolves on them. They performed some sort of ritual. And – they changed into animals.” I met his eyes, which held horror but no disbelief. “Father Vestille. They’re the wolves that have been attacking everyone. They become wolves.” Father Vestille stared at me, then swallowed hard. “Are you all right?” he asked again. I gave a small nod. “Did they see you?” I felt cold inside. “Yes. They chased me. I shot a few of them.” “You shot them?” He seemed equally horrified. “Yes,” I said, offended. “It was wise at the time.” He sighed with some irritation. “Go on.” “Never mind,” I said, starting to rise. He remained in his stool and put a hand on my shoulder. His eyes were penitent. “Please.” I fumed for a moment, then sat back down. “I saw their leader. He removed his hood to drink 274 some potion that changed him into a wolf.” I swallowed. “It was Duke Leopold Laurent.” Father Vestille’s eyes widened. He continued to glare at me for several seconds. “The other day,” he muttered. I squinted at him. “What day?” He looked off, grinding his teeth. “The day your – your mother and Suzette – were killed. Duke Laurent invited me to his chateau for a talk.” My nerves flared with rage. “About what?” He set his jaw, narrowing his eyes. “To see how your family was faring. After the loss of your father.” I gasped and shook. Laurent had planned every attack. The banquet to make Francois drunk while Laurent’s own friends surrounded him at the tavern, waiting to strike at his home later that night. Then luring Father Vestille away from Mama and Suzette so the Lycanthru could murder them in broad daylight. Laurent. “Helena. I’m glad you choose to confide in me, but – why, exactly, are you telling me all this now?” I shivered. We both knew I had pushed him away for years, rejected his every offer of help or friendship. “Someone needs to know,” I said. “I can’t be the only one. Someone else needs to know, in case …” I broke off, uncertain how to finish. He finished for me, his eyes wide. “In case anything should happen to you.” He rose and turned away, frustrated. “I told you the Lycanthru 275 were dangerous. And if the Duke of La Rue Sauvage is involved –.” I stood and leaned toward him. “He’s not just involved. He’s leading them!” “Leading them against you!” he said. “Because you challenged them. Because you sought them out and found them.” “I can’t change what I’ve already done.” “But what will you do now? Will you go on fighting them? Killing them? These are not animals, Helena. They’re human beings.” “They’re not animals, and they’re not human beings. They left their humanity behind to become these things.” “You can tell yourself that if you wish. It’s still murder.” “This is a war!” “A war you started.” “No. A war they started. They’re killing innocent people. Innocent children! And you want me to let them!” “You know I don’t want that.” “I don’t know what you want. You want to help me. You want to shelter me and care for me. But you don’t want me to fight the things that killed my family.” He strode at me. “Because I don’t want them to kill you, too!” We held one another’s gaze for a moment. He was shaking. “I don’t want them to, either,” I said quietly. “But I can’t let them take any more children. Ever again.” 276 He struggled to calm himself, unable to respond. He knew what I felt, having hidden my family away during the war. But it seemed he had forgotten how to take risks to protect innocent people. “Helena. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. But I’m worried. Not just for your physical well-being, but also for your soul. If you wage this war, I fear for what you might become.” My stomach churned. He was like a man with a musket who refused to fire at the predators on his doorstep. “If you’re that concerned about what I’ll become, I can find another place to stay, so you won’t be burdened.” As I folded my arms and stepped away, I realized I felt something more than disgust at his cowardice. I feared he might be right. If I kept on fighting these monsters, could I become just as cold-hearted and bloodthirsty? Would I become the scar-faced monster that Jacque Denue and his cronies feared? “You are no burden,” Father Vestille insisted. “You can stay here for as long as you wish. I will gladly shelter you and feed you, and give you whatever you need to live a full and rewarding life. But I cannot help you kill.” I kept my back to him. I couldn’t expect a priest to help me kill anyone, beast or not. It seemed he was doing everything for me that his faith would allow. Which made me question my own faith. Was I truly seeking justice or merely revenge? Yet how could I let them ravage our people, our world, while I retreated into a safe, 277 warm house and pretended there were no monsters outside my door? When I could do something to stop it. I turned to face him. “Right now, what I need most is your confidence in me.” “I have every confidence in you, Helena,” he said. “But I cannot help you take up a sword. I might as well be putting it to your throat. It will only end in death.” I kept my body rigid. I couldn’t let him know the fear I felt, or let him put any of his own fear into me. I had no choice but to fight these beasts. Except to retreat, and wait to die. I lifted my chin. “Then let’s say we understand one another, and agree to disagree on what must be done.” He looked sad and distant, as if I were his own daughter leaving home, never to return. As though he was mourning the loss of my soul. I prayed he would be wrong. “I will accept that, for now,” he said. “I only want to help you, Helena. You’re all the – You are the only one left from your family. I don’t wish to lose you, too.” “I’ll do everything I can to see that you don’t. I promise.” He glanced aside, shuffled his foot, cleared his throat. “Come. Finish your supper and you can get some rest.” I followed him to the table without another word and did as he said, like a condemned man marching to the gallows. 278 Crimson woke before me. He stood in the darkness, where stripes of light shone through the cracks in Father Vestille’s floorboards above us. I ignored both Crimson and the light and shut my eyes, drifting back into a swallowing sleep. I woke perhaps an hour later, feeling refreshed and stronger. I sat up on the cot and had an odd feeling. A feeling of freedom and security. Of home. The underground cellar held little light or fresh air, but it was safer than any place where I could take refuge above ground. Where the wolves reigned. I stood to my feet and stretched. I wore one of Father Vestille’s old nightshirts, which hung down to my knees. But it kept me warm through the night, along with the blanket, and helped me feel human again for the few hours I slept. I looked about for my clothes. Then I remembered Father Vestille had offered to scrub them clean for me, despite my protests. I smiled now at the thought of him with a basin of soapy water and a washboard, working away at the filth on my pants. The pants he was embarrassed for me to wear in public, as anyone would be. The pants I wore to move freely enough to kill the wolves, which deeply disturbed him. Yet he cleaned them for me, despite his discomfort with my new life. It almost felt like having parents again. Someone to care for me. To accept and support me, even if he didn’t agree with my choices. I started toward the ladder to retrieve my clothes. Then I found them right in front of me, 279 folded in a basket at the foot of the ladder, along with my cloak and boots. The basket had a rope tied to its handles, which lay in a heap beside it. He had finished the work and lowered the container to the floor, mindful of my modesty by not entering the room. He was a good man. Better than I had thought, while he cared for Mama and Suzette over the past several months. Better than I treated him. Still, for all he had done to help us during the war and for all he did to shelter me now, he had still abandoned us when we needed him most. When I needed him most. After the wolf attacked, we needed courage and guidance, but he was away visiting other provinces, other churches. Seeking his own escape instead of facing them down, however he could. If he wanted to help me now, I would gladly accept it, but I couldn’t forget the past. I sighed and grunted. I had no time to mourn his choices. From the look of the sunrays filtering from upstairs and my well-rested state, it was already midday. Only a few hours left to report last night’s events to Pierre before darkness set in again. I reached for my clothes and carried them to the cot with my cloak and boots. Time to set to work. 280 30. L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne smelled of rich oil and fire from the day’s work, nearly over now as dusk approached. Monsieur Leóne was away again, delivering special orders and securing more material. Pierre could not stop gaping at me for the entire time I told my tale. The events of last night – the Lycanthru, their ability to speak, the clear effect of the silver bolts, their new fear of my hood – every detail enthralled him. I told him everything, except for two significant details. 281 “Where did you go afterward?” he asked. I curled my lip. “I can’t tell you that.” He blinked, wounded. “Why not?” “Pierre, I trust you and I value your help. But I can’t reveal everything that I’m doing. Just trust that I’ve found shelter.” “But why can’t you stay here? You’re welcome to sleep in the loft anytime you want.” I touched his hand to show my gratitude. “I know. But I can’t let anyone find me here, or find you. Too many people know I’ve visited you before. That alone places you in danger. And I can’t let anything – I don’t want to endanger you any further.” His brows curved up with hurt, but he nodded his understanding. “Did you see any of them?” I blinked. “The wolves?” “The Lycanthru. Did you see any of their faces? Recognize anyone?” I stared blankly at him, imagining his obvious emotions on display as one of the Lycanthru – perhaps Duke Laurent himself – questioned him. I pictured the Lycanthru seeing through Pierre’s attempts to protect me as he claimed to know nothing. I saw them seize him by the throat and drag him deep into the woods where their mouths would transform into hungry jaws. “No,” I said. “I never saw their faces. I don’t know who any of them are.” Pierre frowned. “Too bad.” He locked his gaze on me. “Especially if they know who you are.” 282 “They don’t. Yet,” I assured him. “But they will.” “Red, don’t do anything dangerous.” I blinked at him. “I think it’s too late for that.” “Anything more dangerous than you’ve already done,” he clarified, sounding annoyed. “If you keep after them, they’re going to come after you. And they’ll find you.” “I don’t think so,” I said, thinking of the safety of Father Vestille’s hideaway. Wondering how long it might remain safe. “In any event, they’ll be searching for me already, don’t you think?” Pierre swallowed hard. “Of course. You saw them. Saw what they do. They won’t let that pass.” I nodded. “Which means I’ve got to stop them first.” “Red, you can’t! These people – these monsters, whatever they are – how can you stop them? You don’t even know who they are or where to look for them next.” “I know where to start.” “All right. Then I’m coming with you.” “No, you’re not.” “Come on, Red. How do you expect to stop me from following you? You know I’m a faster rider.” “I know.” I sighed and turned toward the other work table beside us, wishing I could take him along and lean on his help. But it would mean exposing him to the Lycanthru and marking him 283 for death, the way I had been marked. “Forgive me later?” I asked. He squinted, confused. “For what?” I struck his jaw hard and he spun in a half-circle on his way to the ground. Thankfully, his head missed the edge of the oak table. I dropped the heavy chunk of lead back on the work table, where I had just snatched it. I shook my stinging hand as I stared at Pierre’s quiet body lying on the floor, hoping the lead punch wouldn’t leave much of a bruise. I wanted to embrace him, stroke his head, thank him for his endless support and care. Instead, I had knocked him unconscious. I kept staring at him, wishing I was a different person. Someone he could love and be happy with. But I wasn’t. The Lord had assigned me a strange destiny, however short-lived it might be. To stop as many of these murdering creatures as I could. Before they finally killed me, too. I blew Pierre a silent kiss, hoping he truly would forgive me as I asked. For what I had done and for whatever I was becoming. I stepped over him and headed out the door. 284 31. The same hush fell over the crowd of swaying onlookers as I entered La Maison tavern, crossbow in hand. Before I pushed through the heavy doors, they were joking, shouting, jostling one another. Now they all fixed a silent gaze on me before quietly returning to their drinks and murmured discussions, stealing glances at me over their shoulders and cupped hands. No one risked speaking to me, perhaps fearing my wrath, or being otherwise drawn into my dangerous world. 285 Touraine eyed me from the bar as well, ending his conversations and shooing people away. He turned his back to me as I approached and took a seat on the stool. “Order a drink,” he muttered. I considered reminding him that his tavern refused to serve young girls, but this was no time to make sport. People were watching us. I laid my crossbow on the counter. “Monsieur,” I said, as if I was seizing his attention. He turned. “A glass of your best wine, if you please.” He soured. “Buttermilk it is,” he said, reaching below the counter. I frowned. He had not forgotten, after all. “Just put some water in a mug. And make it look dangerous.” He took a new mug and pitcher, turning his back to me again. “You had another busy night.” “Very busy. You heard of it, then?” “Heard there was a hunt. Heard some men found a pile of dead wolves out in the woods. Large ones. But no one knows who found them, and there’s nothing there anymore.” I narrowed my eyes. “Nothing there? Then how do they know there were any wolves there in the first place?” Touraine bowed his head, pretending he needed to polish a mug with his rag. “A rumor. Some claim they saw that red rider fighting wolves in the forest. They say he left a few there, dead. But they’re gone now. Others say that’s just a rumor spread by some drunkards. What do you say?” 286 He handed me the mug and I drank, wondering how to pretend it was alcoholic. I decided to drink it slowly, staring at the counter while he pretended to ignore me. I lowered my voice. “It’s no rumor. I assume someone started talking about last night’s events until they were ordered to keep silent.” I took another sip of water. “Have those men been back tonight? The ones who love hearing about wolf attacks?” “Same place as always. They’re calmer tonight, though, maybe because Duke Laurent joined them. He made a rare appearance.” My nerves flared. I turned to see them, gathered around their usual table. Lieutenant-General Sharrad sat near the head, with his gleaming blue-gray eyes. Duke Leopold Laurent was seated beside him, like a spider at the center of its web. The Duke’s royal advisor, Simonet, sat in the next chair, wearing his usual callous expression. They all studied me with violent disdain. I grabbed my crossbow and rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle?” Touraine asked, turning suddenly. “Mademoiselle, where are you going?” he demanded in a whisper. Once more secured, the crossbow hung at my hip as I strode toward the table. The table where the Lycanthru gathered to celebrate their victories after attacking people in the village. After chewing on the flesh of innocent mothers and fathers and five-year old girls. My boots clomped across the floorboards as I marched at them, my 287 cloak rippling behind me. They set down their drinks and sat taller, their backs rigid, their attention focused. Nearby observers shrank back, hunching over their drinks, eager to avoid us. I stood before the Lycanthru and stared straight at Laurent. No one moved. Duke Laurent squinted, confused. He blinked in surprise. “Helena?” A strange smile twisted across his lips. “Is that Helena Basque beneath that hood?” He recognized my scars across the lower half of my face. I no longer cared. I grabbed a nearby chair and slid it to the end of the table, opposite Laurent. I sat, with all eyes on me, as I lifted my hands to draw back the hood, revealing my face and blonde hair. Their eyes bulged in an odd mixture of horror and delight. They seemed outraged to discover their adversary was a mere girl. Yet they seemed all the more eager to take their revenge, now that they had seen my face. “So,” Laurent said, breaking the thick silence. “I haven’t seen you since – oh, yes. Since your little sister’s funeral.” Blood surged through my neck and temples. I wanted to lunge across the table and strangle him. But I could do nothing here, with so many witnesses. People who only knew Duke Laurent as I once did: a generous benefactor to our tiny community, a man we were all blessed to have leading us. He was a true wolf in sheep’s clothing. 288 Seeing he had rattled me, he continued to study my reactions with measured calm. I couldn’t let him unsettle me again. “Well,” he went on. “… What new things have you been up to lately?” I stiffened my posture. “A lot of hunting. Late at night.” Scorn lined every face around the table. I could almost feel, almost smell, their hatred of me. Even Simonet narrowed his eyes with bitterness. I was only a girl, but they wanted to destroy me at least as much as I wanted to destroy them. Laurent twisted his lip. “So I hear.” “So you witnessed,” I said. “From your platform.” The men around the table drew a sharp intake of breath. Sharrad bared his teeth, looking so savage I thought he might spring for my throat. Laurent fingered his mug, lifted it and drank. Then he continued to study me. “You seem to have learned a lot in one night.” “Not enough. I know what you are. What you become. But I don’t know which of you attacked me, or which of you banded together to kill Francois Revelier. Or the rest of my family.” Laurent squinted at me, cockeyed. “You’re accusing us of attacking you, Helena? And of killing your woodcutter friend? Forgive me, but I thought you were both attacked by a wolf. Isn’t that the story you’ve been telling everyone? Weren’t you attacked by a big, bad wolf?” The men snickered. 289 Laurent continued, like the ringmaster of a traveling circus troupe. “If you change your story now and say you were attacked by a man – well, I’m not sure how many people will believe you.” “There were witnesses.” “Oh?” Laurent asked in a mocking tone, as if this was new information. “Where are they now? Was that woodcutter one of them? Or your Grand’Mere? Or your Papa?” Hot blood filled my temples. Laurent folded his hands, satisfied. “Seems you’re the only one left to tell your tale, Helena. And reasonable people don’t often listen to hysterical little girls who lose their temper at funerals and refuse to associate with anyone. Especially when they take to dressing in men’s clothes and running through the woods late at night, hunting for witches and big bad wolves.” The others burst into laughter, except for Simonet. He continued to watch me with reserved eyes. I waited for the others to finish their mindless chuckles. “I’m not interested in exposing your dirty secret activities.” “No? Then how can I help you, Mademoiselle?” My cheek twitched, but I kept my body rigid. “I only want our province, once and for all, to be rid of you.” They stared at me in stunned silence. Then exploded into laughter. One man actually wiped tears from his eyes while attempting to regain his composure. 290 Laurent looked over the heads of his comrades and smiled. Other raucous conversations had resumed behind us, drowning out whatever was said at our table. Laurent smiled at the group and leaned forward. “Mademoiselle, let us be honest. You’ve done very well. You struck at us and actually did some damage. I’m not so proud that I cannot admit you beat us down. Twice. So you have my respect and admiration, and I congratulate you.” His grin hardened into stone. “And now it’s over. You cannot seriously hope to ‘rid’ your little province of me. Or the rest of our order, which happens to hold eighty-eight members. All with the same abilities that my friends and I share.” I tensed my back and shoulders, keeping my lips impassive. I couldn’t let him know he frightened me. “Eighty-eight? Still?” He grinned, seeming genuinely amused. “I apologize. You have reduced our ranks down to, what? Seventy-five? Yet as I see it – seventy-five to one? I think we can still rely on our numbers.” “Rely on them while you have them.” Laurent leaned forward again, incredulous. “So you’re serious, are you, Helena? You intend to take us all on?” I said nothing. He kept his eyes on me as he leaned toward Simonet. “Tell me what you see, Simonet.” I met Simonet’s cold eyes, which seemed to pierce my soul. “She’s passionate in her position, Your Grace. Unfortunately for her, she has no real plan. 291 She might continue to do damage, but she knows she won’t last long.” I tried to steel myself against all fear. To keep him from seeing it. Laurent turned to his right. “What do you think, Sharrad? Does she look serious?” Sharrad locked his gaze on me. His thin lips spread in a cruel smile. “I think she looks delicious.” His stare burned into me until I could actually feel his hunger. “You don’t frighten me,” I told him, stiffening my shoulders to convince myself. “You killed my Grand’Mere and you scared me in the tunnel when I was a child. But you won’t frighten me again.” Laurent squinted and exchanged looks of confusion with Simonet and Sharrad. “You think that Lieutenant-General Sharrad killed your Grand’Mere?” “I recognize his eyes.” Laurent seemed to understand, but acted as if I had said something amusing, while Sharrad’s nostrils flared. “Helena, dear. The wolf that killed your Grand’Mere is dead. Your friend, the woodcutter, killed him with an ax. That was not Vigo Sharrad, the head of our police force. Tell her who it was, Vigo.” Sharrad’s blue-gray eyes blazed. “That was my brother, Gustave.” I shuddered, while Laurent grinned with malice. It was Sharrad’s brother, with the same unsettling eyes. 292 “And tell her what you’ve wanted to do since that day, Vigo.” Sharrad twitched, as if wanting to pounce on me. “To devour the one who killed him. Which we did, a few years back. And to finish the job Gustave started.” “He means you, my dear,” Laurent said with delight. “Helena, consider what you’re getting yourself into. I’m willing to forget these recent incidents and we can part ways. I don’t expect us to remain friends, but if you walk away now, I promise you’ll live.” “No guarantee from me,” Sharrad said. Laurent put up a hand to quiet him. “I can keep our order in line, Helena. Including our honorable Lieutenant-General. Out of respect for your achievements – and your considerable losses – I can ensure your survival. However, if you continue this reckless endeavor …” He raised his hands in surrender. “There is little I can do to protect you. You can see how angry my friends are. I believe they want your blood.” “Blood, flesh and bone,” another man snarled beside me, his hair and eyes wild. “So as the last living member of your family,” Laurent continued. “If you place any value on your life at all, you’ll take this chance now to leave, unharmed. Otherwise, I cannot be certain what will happen to you.” He seemed to expect me to believe his lies, the way Papa did. I no longer bothered to hide the trembling throughout my body, even from Simonet. Despite my fear, I now shook with 293 something else: rage. “Nothing is ever certain in La Rue Sauvage, Monsieur Laurent. Except death.” I pushed the chair away and stood. My cloak whirled behind me as I strode toward the door. “Where are you going now, little girl?” Sharrad called across the room. I spun back at them, the blood filling my cheeks as they laughed. Sharrad meant to unnerve me, using the same words the black wolf had used. His own brother, the Lycanthru with shining eyes who killed my Grand’Mere and left me scarred. They wanted to remind me that, after all these years, I would not find anyone to believe my reports about them. About men who changed into talking wolves and threatened to gobble up little girls in the night. They meant to remind me that I was completely alone in my fight against them. But I already knew that. I raised the repeating crossbow to my shoulder and they abruptly froze, falling dead silent. Two of them shrank back. Other conversations stopped abruptly around the large room. “Hunting,” I said flatly. Everyone in the tavern watched me, with what might have been awe or revulsion. Either way, it was mixed with fear, which was what I needed. I had made the Lycanthru afraid. If the rest of the town feared me as well, so be it. I stepped outside and mounted Crimson, anxious to ride off and get my shaking under control. They had unnerved me, but I had also 294 unnerved them. I simply needed to focus on quieting my fears and unleashing my anger. They would remain in the tavern, deliberating over how to deal with me. I would have to be even more cautious about my contact with Touraine and Pierre, to keep them from linking us to one another. Which left me even more alone. I had no choice. I knew what I had to do. What I alone could do. I had destroyed a handful of them. There were seventy-five Lycanthru left. I would start keeping count. I rode hard into the open plain and galloped toward the forest. 295 32. Over the next two months, I fought the wolves, beat them down, struck fear into their hearts. In the waning hours of the night, I snatched one person after another from their jaws. Killed one wolf after another with a silver bolt. Until the whole village knew that someone was fighting for them, and had started to refer to me by the name the wolves had given me: The Red Rider. I couldn’t get at Duke Laurent, but I had reduced his numbers, and I could feel his rage at 296 every wolf I struck down. Knowing I would not give up. Knowing I was thinning his ranks. I continued to take refuge in the underground longhouse beneath Father Vestille’s hovel, while I received secret supplies from Pierre and secret information from Touraine. Though I had to maintain greater caution, now that people were watching me more closely, both wolves and villagers alike. And I had no way of knowing for certain which of the villagers might secretly be wolves. Tonight, Crimson waited for me in a thicket of trees near La Maison, keeping out of sight, while I stole through back alleys toward the rear of the tavern. After waiting for what felt like ages, I seized an opportunity to cross the street, using a passing carriage to hide from onlookers. Then I rushed to the cellar door, yanked it open and dropped inside, finding a basement corridor that led to the recessed storage area. I waited even longer in the wine cellar itself, though I felt far more secure within the quiet room, free of witnesses. Finally, Gerard Touraine descended the steps to the corridor and entered the wine cellar with his lantern. “Monsieur Touraine,” I whispered. He whirled about, wrinkling his brows as he held up the lantern. His face softened as he recognized my hood, hiding behind the wine shelves. “Mademoiselle? Is that you?” “Are you alone?” 297 He glanced over his shoulder on instinct, but there were no other footsteps. “Yes. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in over a week.” “I know. I’ve been finding information elsewhere. It’s safer that way.” He pursed his lips, understanding but looking disappointed. “So why are you here now?” “To see what you know. What you’ve heard. It’s not the safest, but it’s still the best. I haven’t heard much information lately, but I didn’t want to endanger you any more than I had to. I’ll understand if you wish me to leave, to keep yourself safe.” I swallowed, hoping he would not dismiss me. He set the lantern on a wall hook. “I don’t wish that. But there’s one thing I would like.” “What is it?” “Your name. Unless you prefer to be called ‘The Red Rider’ now.” I smiled. “It’s Helena.” He nodded, satisfied. “Helena Basque.” I squinted at him. “If you already knew who I was, why did you –?” “I like to hear from the source directly,” he said. “Now. A boy’s been looking for you.” I blinked. What would Pierre be doing, looking for me at La Maison? Unless I had been too careless, and he had connected my activities to Touraine. “A boy with brown eyes and a mess of blond hair?” 298 He wrinkled his brow. “I didn’t see the color of his eyes, the way he squints. Surly looking fellow. He’s upstairs now, asking for you again.” I blinked. “Who are you talking about?” “Said his name’s Jacque. Jacque Denue.” A flush of anger and fear surged within me. I wanted to confront Denue and start beating on him before he got the chance to hit me again, but I saw no point. “What did he want?” “Wants to meet with you. In private. Said he knows something about the, eh, the ‘Licannors’, something like that.” I stiffened. “The Lycanthru.” “Yes, that’s it. The Lycanthru. Something about the Lycanthru and Duke Laurent.” A dozen possibilities raced through my mind. Had Denue truly discovered something of their secret activities, and of mine? Was he one of the Lycanthru himself, though all their other members were men? Was this another ploy, a petty attempt to ridicule and attack me again? Why seek me out now just to abuse me? “You said he’s upstairs?” Touraine gave a curt nod. “In the bar.” Denue might have some information I could use against Laurent, if he had discovered the Duke’s connection to the Lycanthru. Could he have also discovered something that might help me stop them? “Go about your business,” I told Touraine. “Say nothing to him.” “You don’t wish to meet him, then?” 299 “Perhaps. But I don’t want him to connect me to you. Can you keep him in the bar until nightfall?” “Most likely.” “Good. Can I keep my horse in your stable by the cellar?” “Of course. It’s for guests of La Maison.” I nodded, hoping no one would recognize Crimson. But I had nowhere closer to hide him. “Thank you. If you’re willing, can you find an opportunity to stand there? My horse is just within the forest. I’ll get to the stable and whistle for him when you’re ready, so you can lead him across before anyone sees him.” He considered this, looking up and stroking his chin. Perhaps deciding how to draw the least attention to himself and Crimson when they moved. “Or I can try to lead him there myself,” I said. “You don’t need to risk anyone seeing you with my horse.” He shook his head, smiling. “You’re risking enough, for all the rest of us,” he said. “My pleasure to help … ‘Red Rider’. Be back in ten minutes.” He left. I stood behind the shelves of wine that would so offend Father Vestille, and marveled at Gerard Touraine’s bravery on my behalf. I now saw that Francois placed him in high regard for more than his knowledge of the town gossip. 300 33. From the rooftop of Focult le Tonnelier – Focult’s Cooper Shop across the street – I watched Jacque Denue stroll out of La Maison. The moonlight cast a dark, swaying shadow of his clumsy movements as he continued past the building where I perched. I had stolen out of the cellar as night fell, while villagers poured into the front doors of La Maison. Those who wished to drink were focused only on the tavern entrance, while those who did not were focused on retiring to their own cottages. 301 Giving me ample room to climb to the roof of La Maison with Pierre’s grappling hook, then leap across to Focult le Tonnelier after most of the drinkers went inside. As I had waited and listened, first on one roof and then the other, I heard a few people mention Jacque Denue searching for the Red Rider. Thank God he had not connected me to Touraine. Apparently he had confided his search with several others in the tavern. I now descended from the roof of Focult le Tonnelier into the dark alley to find out why. “You’ve been asking for me,” I said beside him. Jacque Denue nearly fell over his own feet as he twisted about to see me peering at him through my large hood. “You,” he gasped. “Y-Yeah. You’ve been fighting them, haven’t you? Killing them?” I frowned, recalling Father Vestille’s displeasure with my crusade. “Yes.” “You know what they are, right? That they’re not – not wolves. They’re not even human.” He knew. He knew everything I had learned and perhaps more. “Yes. I know. But what do you know? About Duke Laurent?” He looked about, nervous. Almost terrified. “I can’t be seen with you. They’ll kill me.” “They’ll kill you, anyway, so talk.” He shook his head, looking hysterical. “They got people all over, you know? They could be watching us now.” 302 I couldn’t argue with that. The Lycanthru could be hiding anywhere in the shadows, in wolf or human form. He looked around again, over his shoulder and down the street. “Look, I’ll walk a block. Watch where I go and meet me there later. Don’t let anybody see you.” He backed away, half-stumbling as he marveled at my cloaked appearance. I let him depart, then crept to the corner of the wall to see where he headed. He hurried across the street, still glancing in all directions. At the end of the block, he stopped in front of a large horse stable and examined it. Looking around to confirm no one was watching, he threw up the latch on the door and stepped inside. I waited a few moments in the quiet, listening for any other movement. I studied the torch over the tavern door behind me. No one else would leave La Maison this early. I hurried from one alleyway to the next, moving down the street. Then I broke into a quick run for the stable doors and went inside. The stable felt even larger within, with room for over twenty horses. A single lantern at the opposite end of the stable gave sparse light, where Denue stood waiting. He seemed calmer now, standing taller as I strode toward him, my cloak wafting behind me. Nevertheless, his face paled as I approached. “Now,” I said. “Tell me what you know of Laurent.” “All right, I’ll tell you.” His voice turned menacing. “He’s eager to meet you.” 303 Hay shuffled behind me and strong arms coiled around my waist. I gasped as they squeezed harder, pinning my arms into my abdomen. I struggled to break free but my assailant was too strong. He hoisted me off my feet and I noticed a sign burned into the wall overhead: Les écuries de Brocard. These were Monsieur Brocard’s horse stables. The Lycanthru used Denue to set me up. He smirked as two of his cronies strode up from either side of me. I recognized Slob and Freckles as they grinned in triumph. The one holding me had to be Muscles. Denue leaned into my face to gloat. “What you gonna do now, ‘Red Rider’?” His friends laughed. I kicked hard against Denue’s chest with both heels, knocking him off his feet as he wheezed. My kick pushed me back against Muscles and we fell to the ground hard, though his bulk softened my blow. I elbowed his gut and he released me to roll away and rise to my feet. The fifth boy from Denue’s gang stood behind us with a toothy grin. They seemed to have forgotten how I beat them last time. Or they assumed they had me outnumbered. I kicked Muscles’ jaw as he tried to stand. I needed my strongest attacker to stay down. He grunted and moaned like a wounded animal, rolling in the dirt as he clutched at his face. Tooth kept smiling and spread his feet in a fighting stance, as the two beside Denue did the same. Then they all drew hunting knives and held them out, preparing to lunge. 304 “That’s right, wench,” Denue said from behind me. “This time, we brought better weapons than a club.” “Clever,” I said. “Wish I’d thought of that.” I raised my crossbow to Tooth’s startled eyes. He dropped the knife and raised his hands, backing away as I circled behind him. I was out of patience. He joined Slob and Freckles, who still gripped their knives, unsure. I cocked my head at them. Both knives fell to the floor. I nodded toward the ground beside a horse stall. “Over there.” They raised their hands in surrender as they backed toward it. Muscles crawled after them, still rubbing his jaw. Freckles scowled at me. “We’ll get you. You just wait,” he said. I fired a bolt between them. Freckles squealed as it struck the wood of the stall behind him. “Sit down and keep quiet,” I said. They dropped to the floor, hands still raised. I slung the crossbow over my shoulder and approached Denue. He drew a knife from his rear pocket and lunged, the blade flashing in his fist. I kicked up at his wrist and pinned it against a wooden pillar. He whined in pain as the knife fell. I kept his hand there and backhanded him across the jaw. I punched him a second and third time to send him spinning to the dirt. The other boys leaned forward, ready to stand. After I glared at them, they sat back on their 305 hands. I grabbed Denue by his tunic and tugged him to my face. He squirmed, his eyes bulging. “Lemme go, you witch! You wear pants and fight like a man. What kinda girl are you?” “One with little patience.” I shook him for emphasis. “Who told you to attack me? Was it Laurent?” “Yeah,” he grumbled. “Figured it’d be easy to nab a stupid girl.” “Capture? Not kill?” He shook his head. “I ain’t no killer! Just needed money. He’s paying us plenty to bring you unharmed.” “He wants me unharmed so he can harm me himself. You know what he is. You told me yourself.” “That’s what he told me to say, to make you come with us. I don’t know nothing else. Those are just stories to scare little kids!” “They’re not stories and you know it. Even if Laurent was an ordinary man, why would he pay you to capture me? What do you think he’ll do with me? And how long do you think he’ll let you live, after you do what he asks? Another night? Another few weeks?” Jacque shook his head. “He don’t care about me, so long as I help him.” “Once you’ve outlived your usefulness, he’ll make a meal of you. Like he does with the rest of La Rue Sauvage.” “Yeah, so what am I s’posed to do about it?” 306 “You know what sort of girl I am. What sort of boy are you? Sooner or later, he’ll kill you, now that you know his secrets. You can help me stand up to him, or start numbering your days.” “You’re crazy! I ain’t fighting the Duke of the whole province!” “You don’t have to. Just do what he told you to do. Take me to him. Tell him you captured me, but leave me opportunity for escape. When he least suspects it, I can –.” Something shifted in his eyes as he glanced toward the horse stalls. I whirled toward his friends, still seated, in time to see a horseshoe flying at me. It struck my forehead. The stable spun as I fell to the ground. I blinked at the dull pain as everything started to blur. Denue loomed over me, grinning. “Change of plans,” he said. I tried to clutch at him but I could barely sit up. His fist connected with my jaw and everything went black. I woke to shouts. “Imbecile! I told you to bring her last night!” It was Laurent’s voice. I shuddered, feeling cold and confused. I lay on my side, my jaw aching, my head throbbing. My throat tasted like dry manure, and there was a suffocating smell of dust from the surrounding hay. But not from Brocard’s stable where Denue struck me. 307 Somewhere less clean. Somewhere I had been before. I blinked awake with terror. I was back in Brocard’s barn in the forest, where I had intruded on the Lycanthru’s ceremony. Only now I lay on the ground floor, a few feet away from the vat of sulfurous liquid that filled the room with its foul odor. Standing over me on the raised platform, just fifteen feet away from the vat, Laurent glowered at Denue in a rage. “We grabbed some food and fell asleep,” Denue said. “She took a lot out of us. But I got her and she’s here now. What difference does it make?” Laurent backhanded him with a fist that sent Denue sprawling from the platform onto the dirt. “That is the difference, you impudent fool. From now on, do as you’re told.” My shoulder ached where I had been lying on it. My head pounded like a drum. I squinted at the few lit torches smoldering in the room, as rays of the approaching dawn peeked between cracks in the wood walls. How long had I slept? Ten or more of the Lycanthru stood around Laurent. A few wore their black robes and wolf hoods. Others wore their daytime clothes. Laurent’s advisor, Simonet, stood close by, his hands folded behind his back. Beneath their feet, I saw my repeating crossbow. If I could leap for it before they noticed me … 308 My body pulsed as I prepared to rise, but I couldn’t move my hands. I tugged again. Then I fingered the thick hemp binding my wrists behind my back. “Your Grace,” Simonet said in a monotone. I glanced back to find him studying me. “Well, look who’s awake,” Lieutenant-General Sharrad snorted. Laurent’s entire posture relaxed at the sight of me. He strode forward with a jaunt in his step and knelt down. Then he gripped my cheeks hard and lifted my face to his. “Good morning, Mademoiselle. A pleasure to see you again.” I grunted and tried to pull away. The other Lycanthru grinned like hyenas. “But a little too early, I think.” He released my head to fall painfully back to the ground. Then he raised his fist and brought it crashing down onto my jaw. 309 34. I woke again more slowly, roused by the sulfur stench. Sore muscles ached in my shoulders, thighs, and the back of my neck. I struggled to open my eyes as my chin rested heavily against my chest. Wake up, I ordered myself, inhaling the sulfur deeper, listening to the bubbling vat. Wake up! The room was full of sunlight and noise. My temples throbbed and I tried to grasp my surroundings. With an effort, I lifted my head to meet the eyes of Leopold Laurent, flanked by 310 Simonet, Sharrad and about thirty other men. He grinned as he held my crossbow. I flinched and shuddered, which made them all laugh. I felt paralyzed, unable to move anything but my head and neck. I glanced to either side and discovered my arms were spread apart and bound. Thick ropes extended from my wrists to distant supporting pillars. My breath caught in my throat. I tried to move my legs, to stretch my sore thighs. But they also stood apart on the dirt floor, my ankles secured to the same wooden pillars. I stared down at myself, helpless before the entire cult. “Welcome, dear Helena,” Laurent said in mock greeting. “Or should I call you, ‘The Red Rider’?” They exploded with hoots of triumph. All but the stone-faced Simonet, standing at Laurent’s side. A few men wore their black robes, but most were ready to resume the day’s normal work. “I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you chose to visit us,” Laurent continued, like a gracious host. “A pity you can’t stay long. Although you’ll be with us much longer than we hoped. We meant to finish you last night. To – what is the word? Ah, yes. To ‘rid’ ourselves of you.” This drew another round of cruel chuckles as Laurent patted my crossbow. I tried to stay calm as I tugged at the ropes, testing them. They had no give whatsoever. “Unfortunately, your incompetent friend, Jacque Denue, failed to bring you at the proper 311 time, but waited until it was near dawn. We all lead busy lives during the day, which only leaves us the night for our private activities. The saddest part is that I have significant business to tend to this evening, so our plans for you will be delayed even further. But don’t fret, Mademoiselle. Come midnight, we’ll all gather to bid you a fond farewell.” I pulled at the ropes again as a reflex, knowing it was pointless. “You can’t see behind you, Helena, but there’s a long trough there. That’s where we’ll toss your bones when we’ve cleaned all the meat off them.” My breath came in rapid gasps, to each man’s delight. “I claim her belly,” said a gruesome red-haired man. “I want one of her thighs,” Sharrad said with a smile, narrowing his blue-gray eyes. Laurent stepped forward. “All I want is her face.” “Not much meat there, Lord Laurent,” Sharrad said. “No,” Laurent admitted as he stood before me. He squeezed my cheeks together so hard I struggled to breathe for a moment. “But I want to see her eyes, wide and screaming, as she realizes her little adventure is over. Just before I devour her.” I shook in his grip. They were going to eat me! 312 His face hardened into stone. “You should have accepted my offer to walk away, Helena. Instead, you persisted in your stubborn attacks, killing over twenty of us in the last two months. Making quite a name for yourself.” He clenched his teeth, almost snapping them together. “Now you can die like the rest. Except that you’ve earned yourself a much slower, more painful demise. I’m sure you’re quite impressed with yourself, for how well you’ve done. So consider it an honor, the agony we intend to put you through this evening.” I kept still and focused on taking tiny breaths through my nose and teeth. I turned to Simonet, the only one not joining in the others’ celebration. His dull, fixed expression made me tremble even more. “The only reason we’re not feasting on you now is we need moonlight to transform,” Laurent explained. “We don’t need it for long, but it’s easiest for us all to change at night. Once we assume our new shape, we can keep it as long as necessary. But someone in town might notice if fifty men didn’t perform their duties today. And to be frank – every one of us wants a piece of you.” He released my face and I gasped, hanging my head. “Sharrad,” Laurent called. Sharrad stepped forward with a strip of cloth. He yanked it apart with his fists, showing its thickness as he marched toward me. “Why are you doing this?” I asked Laurent quickly. “Why are you attacking everyone?” 313 Laurent held up a hand, stopping Sharrad in his tracks. “Why?” he repeated. He spread his hands like a showman before the other men. “Why not?” They roared with sadistic laughter, as though I said something hilarious. Laurent paced, as if considering the question for the first time. “Power, Mademoiselle. Unlimited, eternal power. The age-old lure of immortality. All we need to do is kill a wolf for its pelt …” He aimed my crossbow between my eyes, smiling as he played a hunter. “And keep it among our possessions. Then, after absorbing a few rays of moonlight, we can transform into the most fearsome creatures the world has ever known. Provided we also drink the Lycanum potion.” He waved a hand toward the foul, bubbling vat. “Together, these things make us stronger. We age less rapidly. We remain powerful, even in our normal form, so long as we continue to feast now and then. Especially when we feast on the innocent.” Quick as lightning, he backhanded my left cheek. It stung like a block of wood. The room spun for a moment while I regained my breath. “You see what I mean?” He yanked off my hood, his force nearly choking me with it. Then he seized a clump of hair at my scalp and wrenched my head back. I gasped at the sharp pain. “But you’re strong, too, aren’t you, Helena? Stronger than anyone imagined. So we have to take extra measures to deal with you. And to make an example of you.” 314 He shook me by my hair. I clenched my teeth and let him hold me like a marionette. Resisting would only make it worse. “The intriguing thing about power, Mademoiselle, is that once a man tastes it, he can’t stop hungering for more. Tonight, when the moon is high, we shall assume our more powerful form.” He leaned close to my cheek, enough for me to smell his last drink of red wine. “Then we’ll feed on you, piece by piece, growing stronger – as you die, screaming.” No, I thought. Lord, don’t let me die like this. Help me escape! Send them away and help me escape! He grinned, my hair trapped in his fist. “I should conclude my business and join the others here by eleven o’clock. Then we’ll spend the night tending to you, for the last time, before we feast on the main course. That gives you a full day to consider your folly and form your apology to me, for your brash interference.” “What about the silver?” I gasped. “Why does it hurt you?” He gave my hair another sharp jerk. “You’re so persistent, Helena. You still hope to learn something to pass on to your friends, if you have any left. If you do, don’t worry. We’ll find them and finish them off. Just like you.” I thought of Pierre and tugged violently at the ropes, in spite of myself. Despite the pain that shot through my scalp as he tugged my head back in place. I considered Father Vestille and Gerard Touraine. A few anxious words from any one of 315 them, wondering whatever happened to me, could be enough to rouse Laurent’s suspicions and seal their deaths. Because of me. His voice softened to a purr. “Of course, if your apology is humble enough, I might let you beg for your friends’ lives. As for the silver …” He rested the point of my crossbow’s loaded bolt against my cheek and stroked me with it like I was his pet. “When your friend, Francois, killed Gustave with his silver ax, we were surprised that anything could harm us. But we consulted the Prime, who is far more experienced in these matters.” “The Prime?” “Don’t concern yourself with that, Helena. In La Rue Sauvage, I am the Prime.” The bolt jabbed at me as he growled, but it didn’t draw blood. He smiled, regaining his composure. “In any event, he explained that different Lycanthru had come into contact with silver over the years and died without explanation. We simply learned to avoid it. We don’t need to know the reason, any more than we need to know why we need the Lycanum or the pelt or the moonlight. We follow the rituals that were written down in prior centuries and reap the benefits. So long as there are unsuspecting villagers with children in our midst, I should live to be well over a hundred, with no one daring to challenge me.” He whispered harshly at my ear. “While you won’t even make it to age seventeen.” 316 He yanked my hair again. I yelped at the sudden pain, which ended abruptly as he released me. I lifted my head lazily, feeling dizzy as the barn and Laurent blurred before me. I blinked and saw that he held a blonde clump of my hair. He regarded it with mild surprise, then smiled at me. “I’ll just keep this as a souvenir.” He slid the hair into his waistcoat pocket as if it was a precious heirloom. I stared in horror and disgust. They were demented, every one of them, and Laurent was the most twisted of all. “Any more questions, Helena? Or are you finished?” I quivered in the ropes. “What do you think, Simonet? Is she through?” Simonet observed me without expression. He descended from the platform and stepped toward me, examining my face like I was an intriguing insect. “She’s frightened, Your Grace,” he said. “She knows it’s over.” I stiffened to keep from losing control. Anything I did or said now would only confirm the truth. I had no plan. No way out. Laurent’s eyes and face relaxed even more. “That’s what I wanted to hear. Now, Sharrad.” He stepped back as Sharrad marched at me with the cloth strip. He ducked under my bound arm and stood up close behind me, his broad chest against my back. “Wait! Someone will find me. You can’t –!” 317 The cloth came down past my eyes and was tugged between my lips. I struggled, my nerves flaring, as Sharrad secured the gag, turning the rest of my sentence into muffled gibberish. He knotted it tight against the back of my neck, catching strands of hair. Laurent stepped forward, studying me with a satisfied smile. I could barely move. Now I could barely utter a sound. He raised the crossbow to my face. “By the way, I believe this is yours.” He tossed it to the dirt beneath me. I stared down at it, loaded and ready to pierce their hearts. I tugged my wrists hard, which only tensed my sore muscles and kept my captors entertained. Laurent gingerly drew the hood back up over my head. “No one is likely to travel this way, but we can’t risk some fool hearing you struggle. Not before we’ve had our fun with you.” He stroked my cheek as if he were still the family friend I once trusted. “Think about how to apologize, Helena, to save a few of your friends. You’ll have all day to consider it. Jacquard will be here to watch over you.” He smiled over his shoulder at a tall unshaven man who nodded from his seat on the steps. “The rest of us would be missed, but Jacquard’s position is …” He pretended confusion. “What is it you do again, Jacquard?” Jacquard twisted his lip with annoyance. “Cooper’s apprentice,” he said. “Oh, yes, that’s it,” Laurent said, as if he had just remembered. “And a poor one at that. His 318 master might be relieved to do without him today. But he can keep an eye on you here, to make sure you don’t – wiggle too much.” He grinned like the devil. “Until tonight, then.” He walked out. Each of the Lycanthru filed out after him, smiling at me as they passed. A few of them waved. One devilish man made a chomping motion at me. I hung there between the pillars, a chill of horror surging through my nerves as they strode by, each one hungry for my blood. Each one eager to taste it when night fell. Behind them, Jacquard squatted and poked at the logs beneath the base of the vat, reducing the flame. I imagined them boiling me for their dinner as I stared into each ravenous glare. A shorter man marched at me, grinning with malice. “The party won’t start ‘til nightfall, Mademoiselle,” he said through tobacco-stained teeth. “Why don’t you get some sleep?” The men behind him laughed as his fist struck me and my world went black. 319 35. I awoke with a start. I lifted my head and blinked, breathing the sulfuric air rapidly through my nose. The gag had grown stale against my tongue. The man named Jacquard rose to a sitting position on the platform, where he had been sleeping. My sudden movement apparently woke him. He snorted, stretched, then regarded me with a scowl. “Up and ready for the day?” he said without humor. 320 It remained bright outside, but the shadows had shifted to the opposite angle. It was a little past noon. I had gotten a full but fitful sleep that I now felt in my sore limbs. I looked back at each of my wrists, still bound to the thick pillars. I shook my numb arms as best I could and rotated my wrists to get the blood flowing back into them. My lower back and the calves of my legs ached from standing suspended for so long. Below me, the crossbow still lay useless on the ground. Jacquard yawned and stood to fully stretch. I heard his back crack as he twisted his torso. Then he faced me with his hands on his hips. “Go on. Struggle some more for me.” I breathed slow and even. “No?” he asked. “Too tired? Get some rest, then. You’ll need all your strength tonight for screaming.” He sat back down and leaned lazily against the long counter beside the bubbling vat. He glanced at it, wondering whether to adjust the fire again. Then he folded his arms and studied me. “You thought you were something, huh? You really thought you could beat us.” He continued to study me from head to toe, watching for any sign of resistance, satisfying himself that I could not escape. Then he rose slowly and walked behind the long counter. He bent behind it and I heard him open cabinet doors and slide heavy objects across shelves. He stood, producing a small flask and a large bottle of liquor. He poured himself a small sampling and sipped it, 321 then eyed me again, looking disappointed that I had not moved a muscle. He lifted his flask toward me. “Your good health, witch.” He emptied the flask and filled it again. I steadied my breathing. Everything had happened so fast, I barely had time to think. And I could do nothing with the entire cult watching me. Jacquard would be a different matter, I hoped. I kept still, spread between the pillars like an animal carcass to be carved and eaten over a fire. Or Samson, the Bible hero who lost his great strength and was captured by his enemies who jeered at him, thinking him helpless. Until he asked them to place him between the pillars that supported their stronghold, where he pushed the supports apart when God restored his strength, destroying them all. I lifted my chin and tried to relax. I allowed Jacquard to study me again before he poured himself another drink. I couldn’t reach the crossbow, but I had a few advantages left. Reminding myself of that helped me calm down. First, they had left only one man to watch me. More important, they imagined me helpless. Which I might be if not for Pierre. Sweet, ingenious Pierre, who suggested the crazy idea of helping me fight like a wolf, before my first night out at Favreau’s farm. “I can’t give you teeth,” he had said, “but I’ve got something that might work for claws.” 322 He was so proud of his brilliant invention, as he should be, always asking me how my blades were working. I fixed my gaze on Jacquard as he tilted back another drink. Then I flicked my wrists, causing the silver blades to slide out from the top pockets in my gloves. They locked in place and I spread my fingers to hide them. If I closed my fists, the broad knives could be seen, extending just beyond my knuckles. With my palms open, Jacquard would never notice me sawing slowly through the ropes behind them. I just had to keep my movements slow and careful. Fine, Pierre, I thought. They work just fine. Shadows of clouds shifted across the floor, from the skylight cut into the overhead ceiling. I scraped away at the ropes, one fiber at a time. It maddened me to cut so slowly. But anything faster would draw Jacquard’s notice. Even more maddening, the ropes’ thickness ensured that I would be scraping through them, one gentle stroke after another, for hours. Of course, once they frayed most of the way, they should pull apart all at once. Then the crossbow would be back in my hands. Jacquard jerked up suddenly, narrowing his eyes. I stood still, like a deer sensing a hunter’s presence. I locked eyes with Jacquard and held still. “Not trying to wriggle free, are you, Mademoiselle?” My heart stopped. I stood rigid, hoping he would not step closer. 323 Jacquard lifted the flask to his lips, still watching me, then drank. I felt a wave of relief as he swallowed and refilled his flask. I resumed my sawing motion, one slow cut at a time, barely moving my wrists. I wondered if I had even made progress, but I dared not glance at the ropes. I had to trust they were fraying, a little at a time, until Jacquard lost interest in me once more. I prayed silent thanks that Laurent had chosen such a lazy guard. A more responsible man might have checked the ropes again to make certain they were secure. But Jacquard had no reason to imagine anything otherwise, not knowing Pierre’s cleverness. Pierre. I had to free myself and warn him. Warn Father Vestille and Touraine. In my rush, my right hand blade wedged between fibers and jerked the rope. Jacquard glanced up, seeing the rope shake. I froze. He almost smiled. “Go on. Try to pull free.” I ignored him, but kept my whole body rigid. Waiting for him to ignore me as well. “No?” he teased. “You’re not even going to try?” He chuckled to himself and poured another drink. I had to slow down. I couldn’t save anyone if Jacquard discovered my actions. I relaxed my breathing and focused. The moment he drained another flask, I glanced to my right. The rope had started to fray. 324 I sawed at it again, seeing new fibers sprout up. Given enough time, I could free myself. I just had to remain calm and patient. An hour later – judging from the shadows beneath me – I had scraped halfway through each rope. A few more strokes and the remaining fibers would start to shred. So long as Jacquard kept his distance for the next hour, I could pounce on him before he knew what happened. The silent crossbow still waited on the ground for me. Just a little more time and steady work … Jacquard sat back on the platform, still sipping from the flask in his hand. Over the last several minutes, his study of me had grown more intense. I eventually stopped worrying whether he could see my blades working. Though he watched my every movement, he could not see the silver shafts behind my palms, or the ropes slowly severing behind them. Yet he focused on me more than ever, while his head bobbed a little from all his liquor. He spent several minutes observing my boots alone. And of course, my trousers, which barely covered my legs. He took another swig of wine, eyeing me strangely. “You know – I like the way you look there, writhing.” My throat went dry. I glanced back down at the crossbow. He rose slowly to his feet and staggered once. I hoped he might fall over unconscious, but 325 he wasn’t drunk enough. “About this power, Mademoiselle. It increases everything. Not just our strength. It also increases our appetites. I need to eat more, smoke more. Drink more.” He lifted the flask. Then his eyes narrowed and traveled the length of my body. “I need more of everything.” I stiffened. As he took another swig, I made broader strokes against each rope. He returned his attention to me and I stopped. He smiled, as if recalling a private joke. “You know, I crave things now that I never wanted before. Never even thought of wanting. Strange things, like seeing a woman – or a child – suffer.” My whole body pulsed and quivered. Jacquard seemed to delight in it, as he approached me in small, measured steps. “Good thing is, brave Mademoiselle, that now I can satisfy all my cravings. No matter how wild they get.” He set his flask at his feet and stood directly before me, smiling and reeking of alcohol. He reached up and gently drew back my hood. Uncovering my eyes and hair and my scarred face. He snorted. “Not too bad, for all that.” He nodded at my triple wounds. “Almost pretty. Anyhow, you’ll do.” I fought to stay calm. To keep from jerking away at his touch, as he stroked my hair below the gag. He undid the knot and pulled the cloth free. I gasped, sucking air into my stale mouth. He seized my face, cutting off my deep breaths. I panicked and tried to pull away but his grip was too strong, squeezing my cheeks tightly the way 326 Laurent had. But Jacquard’s fingers jabbed my skin and pressed against my teeth, determined to produce pain. I shook in the ropes. I cut at them again with a single swipe, while he stood an inch from my face. Then I cut again. And again. “I know, sweet thing,” Jacquard said, enjoying my discomfort. “I’m supposed to leave you unharmed for tonight. For the others. But I figure, when someone’s already this damaged, who’s gonna notice a few more cuts and bruises?” I seethed, clenching my teeth to speak. “I couldn’t agree more, Monsieur,” I said as I sawed through the last fibers. The ropes fell like logs to the ground as my wrists dropped. Jacquard blinked at me, trying to grasp what had happened. I tensed my numb arms and drove my bladed gloves into his sides. His eyes bulged. Then the pain pushed through his stupor and he screamed, a horrid animal cry. He knocked over the flask at his feet and it shattered as his knees buckled. He clutched at my waist to stay upright. I tore the blades free and shoved them into him again. He cried out as the blood clung to my knives. I shook, wanting it to end. Wanting him to be a wolf, so I wouldn’t feel like vomiting, as I stabbed him again. He sank slowly, as tears streamed down my cheeks and his fingers lost their hold. He crumpled to the ground and collapsed on his broken flask. I collapsed onto him, exhausted. 327 I had just killed a man. Not a wolf, but a man. And I could do nothing to take it back. What had I become? Something banged from the rear of the barn, behind the platform. I started suddenly and lifted my head to listen. Had they left another guard behind? Something struck low against the wall again like thunder, much harder than a human could have. Crimson. I pushed myself off of Jacquard and stretched toward my bound ankles. I couldn’t hope to return to a standing position with my feet so far apart, but I stretched enough to saw through the rope encircling the inside of my heel. Once I freed my other foot, I shook my legs to get the blood flowing back into them. Then I raced to the platform door and threw it open. Beyond it, I found a spacious stable with eight stalls, only two of them filled. One with a horse that must have belonged to Jacquard. The other with Crimson. He whinnied in a fitful rage as he saw me, tossing his head in the stall. He must have put up a tremendous fight after they found him, because they had bound him in a cat’s cradle of ropes, much like they bound me, securing his legs, flanks and neck, so he could only shake helplessly until they returned. He was the main course Laurent spoke of, that they would enjoy after finishing me. I threw open the stall door and saw he had finally wriggled one hoof free to kick at the wall. I 328 hugged his neck to calm him. It did little to still my own rage, which began to boil over. “It’s all right, boy,” I seethed. “It’s all right. We’re leaving this place.” Night fell like thick tar. The flame beneath the vat had nearly died out, but I could still smell the sulfur amidst the barn’s choking dust. At long last, I heard their horses approach and gallop around the barn to the rear stable. The door to the stalls creaked open and there was a murmur of confusion and rage. I smiled, imagining their faces as they discovered Crimson was no longer bound in their cruel trappings. Then came quick footsteps and the sound of the connecting door as it flew open. The men rushed into the center of the barn with their lanterns, scanning the darkness for me and Jacquard. They found Jacquard soon enough. His dead body now hung where the Lycanthru had positioned me, between the two pillars. It had taken an hour, with Crimson’s help, to string him up properly. It was monstrous, I knew. But far less cruel than the Lycanthru tying me there alive. They held their lanterns up to his face to confirm he was dead. They wondered among themselves what had happened, how I had escaped, where I had run off to, where my horse had gone. More of them poured in, as I hoped they would. At first there were only a dozen or more. Then I counted eighteen, soon twenty-five, finally thirty-329 three. They flooded in so quickly I nearly lost count, but I kept them in my sights. I had to know how many there were. They huddled together in outrage, blaming Jacquard’s carelessness, blaming one another, demanding answers. They prepared to search the barn, raising their lanterns and looking about. Only one of them sniffed at the alcohol in the air and fingered a piece of the hay that I had stuffed into Jacquard’s shirt. I smiled. They had each brought the very weapons I needed. I stood up suddenly from the overlooking hayloft and stared through the enormous square hole at the men searching below. Hay and dust fell from my shoulders and my spreading cloak as I raised the repeating crossbow. My first shot tore through the lantern of the man standing in front of Jacquard’s corpse. It yanked the lantern from his grip and knocked it into Jacquard’s back, which I had dressed with hay and doused in liquor. The body burst into flames, a human candle that lit the length of both thick ropes. The fire caught on the pillars, also sprinkled with alcohol. Everyone gaped at the erupting blaze as I shot through the lanterns of two other men. The first one struck the ground and started an insignificant flame on one side of the barn. But the second hit its mark on the opposite corner where I had spilled more liquor, creating a blaze that roared to life against the wall. It followed the trail of alcohol that lined the interior, the fire scrambling along the wall to connect at each corner. 330 The Lycanthru’s eyes bulged as the room heated up rapidly. Crimson whinnied and rose from the darkness beneath the hayloft. I whistled and he leaped into position. I dropped onto his saddle, ignoring the bruising in my groin and thighs, and drove him to kick open the front door. We rushed into the night air and I leaped off to secure the entrance. The men recovered from their shock and charged at me as I shut the door and threw the locking bar down. Crimson trotted back to retrieve me while I drove three bolts into the bar for good measure. A sudden shuffling of dirt within told me the Lycanthru had halted upon seeing the protruding silver bolts. I stepped into Crimson’s right stirrup with one foot and held on as he whisked me to the rear stable. I jumped off as two men emerged from the rear door, one carrying a lantern. I shot them both where they stood. I shut the stable door and threw the bar down, then shot my final two bolts into it. After grabbing the Lycanthru’s discarded lantern, I mounted Crimson to circle around the barn. Light and heat emitted from every wall. Nevertheless, I took the lantern and hurled it against the front door, as the Lycanthru pounded against the inside of it. “Rider!” they raged. “Rider!” The lantern burst into a spreading blaze that licked up the alcohol on either side of the door and raced along the outer wall. I had lined the walls with liquor from corner to corner, inside and out, and spread the hay out evenly within. Creating an 331 inescapable tomb of flames. I watched the rest of Brocard’s barn erupt in a rising inferno, climbing higher and higher into the black sky, like a sacrifice on an enormous altar. So now I was a murderer. I had killed thirty-three men in less than a minute. Thirty-three men who gave themselves over to black magic to prey on the people of La Rue Sauvage. On innocent children. But no more. Whether I was a warrior or a murderer, I could do nothing to change it. I didn’t ask them to attack my family. That was their doing. And this was the result. For them, and for me. So be it. I turned Crimson away from the mounting inferno and the Lycanthru’s raging screams as fire billowed up every high wall. My cloak flapped behind me as we rode hard into the forest. I spotted a few other Lycanthru with lanterns moving into the clearing, stunned by the sight of the blaze. One noticed me riding off but only gaped at me, too surprised to give chase. I had enough moonlight to find my way through the well-traveled woods. I was glad I had abandoned the lantern, giving them no way to track me. My heart and pulse raced, my nerves hot with rage and fear. They meant to kill us, to devour me and Crimson for their own sadistic pleasure. They only received a portion of what they deserved. But I would serve up more to them before daybreak. 332 I never meant to become this, whatever I actually was. A murderer. Perhaps a monster. Whatever I had become, and whatever would become of me now, I would see to it that I destroyed the rest of the Lycanthru. I would see to it that no more innocent people in La Rue Sauvage suffered at their hands. I never meant to become a sixteen-year old warrior, and despite what Father Vestille believed, I had not started this war. But I would end it. 333 NOTE FROM AUTHOR D.A.

      "content": "I stiffened, my blood racing through my veins. The same blue-gray eyes of the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me scarred. The same eyes of the wolf that Pierre and I met in the dark tunnel. What in God’s name did it mean? “I’m Lieutenant-General Vigo Sharrad,” he said, his words coming to me in a fog. “It’s my job to protect the people of La Rue Sauvage. And their farmland.” “I think someone’s been spreading rumors, Monsieur Sharrad,” Touraine said casually. Sharrad jutted his broad chin at Touraine, as if threatening to stretch forth and bite him. “And who’s spreading those rumors, do you think?” Touraine shrugged. “I don’t know. But I can’t imagine anyone fighting off a pack of wolves on their own. Let alone this – person wearing a bright red cloak. Can you?” “I can imagine a number of things.” Sharrad glared back at me. “I expect you’ve got a wild imagination, too, don’t you, Monsieur?” “Monsieur,” Touraine broke in again, leaning on the counter with a smile. “This gentleman’s just here for a drink. Maybe some people don’t like how he looks. Maybe they’re jealous of his cloak. So they’re making up stories about him. He hasn’t really done anything, has he?” 245 Sharrad’s eyes burned into me. I kept my head lowered, but kept watching him from the shroud of my large hood. Watching his eyes. “Not yet,” Sharrad said. “But I’ve heard reports, and I’ll be watching you, Monsieur. If I hear of any more unprovoked attacks on wolves or other animals, you’ll see me again.” “But, Monsieur,” Touraine continued. “If someone’s killed some of the wolves that are attacking people, that would be good, wouldn’t it?” Sharrad faced him with his fists on his hips. “When I need a tavern keeper to help me keep order in the village, you’ll be the first man I call on. Until then, keep quiet and bring me and my friends another round.” “Of course. Sorry, Monsieur. Be there in a moment.” Sharrad cast another glare in my direction. “You keep that crossbow put away while you’re indoors, understand?” I gave a slow deliberate nod. Sharrad regarded me another moment before striding away to his table. I shivered as I watched him go. I couldn’t have seen what I thought I did. It was impossible. But I couldn’t deny it. Those shining eyes were unforgettable. I would have to watch Lieutenant-General Sharrad closely until I could reason it out. Touraine glanced in Sharrad’s direction. “Try not to get yourself arrested. Or killed. Seems you’re making the wrong people angry. Of course, now that you’ve killed a couple of giant wolves, you probably think you can handle anything.” 246 “Tell me about those men. The ones who enjoy hearing about wolf attacks.” He nodded back at Lieutenant-General Sharrad before turning to line up several mugs on a tray. “He’s one of them. So is Brocard. They come in here with their friends every time there’s an attack. Someone from their group is usually the first to report it.” He wrinkled his brow. “Matter of fact, I never knew you used a crossbow, ‘til Brocard offered you more bolts.” “I thought Favreau told everyone that.” Touraine shook his head as he filled each mug in turn. “No one’s seen Favreau. His brothers found his stray pigs and rounded up most of them. But Favreau wouldn’t come out or let his daughter out, even when they beat on his door. Kept telling everyone to go away.” I felt an inner chill. “So how did anyone know about the wolf attack last night? How could anyone know I was there?” Touraine leaned over the counter and spoke in a lower tone. “Be careful. Someone knows what you did, and they’re spreading the word.” “Someone who was there,” I said. “Someone like Sharrad and his friends.” He seemed to consider this as he resumed filling the mugs. “Likely.” “So am I some kind of pariah now?” “Maybe. No one’s sure what to make of it. Someone attacking wolves late at night on a farm and killing two of them. Some think you’re a hero. Most of them didn’t believe you existed.” He 247 surveyed the room of hushed murmurs. “Of course, they do now.” I turned to view Sharrad and his table. The murmur of the crowd hushed as I faced them. Some men watched my every move, perhaps fearing I might draw my crossbow again. Sharrad’s cold eyes continued to focus on me. Beside him, Brocard raised his mug toward me with a smile. None of the other seven men at their table were smiling. They stared at me or looked over their shoulder, scowling and whispering at one another’s ear. They were all dressed differently, representing different jobs, different ages, different tastes. Yet they shared the same vicious scowl. I wouldn’t trust myself alone in a room with any of them. “How often are those men in here?” “Every night on the weekends,” Touraine said. “Either that crowd or some of the others.” “There are more?” “Plenty more. A few dozen, I’d expect. All different walks of life. Some farmers, some carpenters, merchants, woodcutters, coopers, blacksmiths. Some of them are very well off, some are barely managing. Not sure what they’ve all got in common. Except maybe a cruel sense of humor.” He shook his head again. “I’d stay away from them, if I were you.” I studied the surly gang across the room as they eyed me with contempt. “Yes,” I said. “That would be wise.” 248 27. It was near midnight before Sharrad and his associates left the tavern. I spied on them from a dark alley, feeling the evening’s chill, as Crimson waited behind me in quiet obedience. They seemed in good spirits now, shoving playfully at one another and making threatening growls, like rough-spirited children. Like Jacque Denue and his companions. Hairs rose on my skin. I could see what Touraine meant about avoiding these men. I didn’t 249 want to go anywhere near them. But I had to know how they were connected with the wolves. They mounted their horses and trotted off toward the woods. Brocard, still utterly pleased with himself, led the way with a lantern held aloft. I allowed them time to gain some distance, then climbed onto Crimson’s saddle and rode after them, following their distant light. About ten minutes later, Brocard and the others entered a large clearing on the outskirts of a sprawling farm. I tugged gently on Crimson’s reins, keeping us shrouded and still in the forest. The men rode ahead in full view, toward the large barn at the center of the pasture. Whoever owned this land seemed well-off. A wheat field spread for several acres beyond the grove of trees that hid the barn and silo. Yet there was no house connected with the barn, so the owner could afford to hire out farmers while he sat at home raking in profits. Sharrad and the others dismounted and glanced about, looking over their shoulders. Crimson kept perfectly still for me in the shadows. Once they were satisfied, Brocard raised his torch higher and led the way to the barn. He tugged open the front door. More torches blazed within, where several other men had gathered. I couldn’t see any particular person, only a small crowd. As a few of the men led their horses around back, Brocard and the others went inside, casting 250 final glances over their shoulders before they shut the door. Something felt wrong, unsettling me like a snake burrowing under my skin. I prodded Crimson forward by cautious steps into the shadowy grove, surveying the grounds to make sure no other men approached. A noise rose within the barn, like a unified cheer, or a collective moan from a herd of beasts. Crimson slowed his pace, and I couldn’t blame him. I felt a crawling chill in the air. Like something small and devilish laughing in the wind. We edged forward to the side of the barn. I dismounted and drew Crimson to stand close to the wall. The din inside grew louder and clearly human, almost musical in its unison. I crept to the front door and searched for a discreet way to enter. Up above, beams of light broke through the wall, revealing the loading entrance for stockpiling hay. I withdrew Pierre’s grappling hook and slid back the lever, letting its prongs spring out. I squinted, spotting a small triangular hole above the loading door where the wood had worn through. I swung the steel hook in circles, then let it fly. It caught the hole above the door and I tugged on it, feeling it embed itself in the wood. I paused, listening for any sudden movement, then started up the wall. Thankfully, I only had a few steps to climb to the loft. I righted myself and stepped carefully along the slim ledge as the strange rhythm grew louder within. I tugged the prongs free to return the hook to my belt and cracked the door open. 251 Hay and dust trickled down from the pile that had been shoved against it. I wrinkled my nose at the moldy straw that had been pushed to the outer edges by fresh hay. I spread the hay apart with cautious fingers, as if wading through weeds in a pond. The noise beyond the hay pile grew louder and stronger, the chant drumming through my entire body as I pushed deeper inside. Something reeked of sulfur, permeating the inside of the barn. Finally, I broke through part of the hay to peer through a giant square hole in the center of the loft. A large throng of men stood in formation on the floor below, dressed in black hooded robes and chanting in a strange language that sounded like Latin. Towering torches burned at either end of the ceremony. One robed man stood on a platform between two short pedestals, his arms raised to the assembly. Each hood depicted a grinning wolf, making them all look like black wolves with the robed bodies of men. Behind the leader, a large vat bubbled up something foul, the offensive sulfur odor I had detected. The hypnotic chant continued as two men each brought an animal carcass toward the leader. They laid both corpses on a pedestal, bowed to the leader, and backed away to resume their positions. They were two dead wolves. I shuddered. I had found the Lycanthru. Something shuffled nearby. I noticed four robed men standing on either side of me, looking down on the ceremony from separate corners of the loft. I steadied my breathing and didn’t move. 252 The leader produced a curved dagger and cut away a section of one wolf’s back. He held up the small rectangular pelt, showing it to the crowd as the chanting slowed. Then he wrapped it around the back of his neck, wearing it like a priest’s collar. As he did so, the other men produced similar wolf pelts and placed them around the backs of their own necks. Then the leader pointed straight up. Was he pointing at me? I held my breath. No one reacted to my presence. Instead, they craned their necks toward a skylight cut into the roof, which shed moonlight on each of them. The leader lifted his arms, welcoming the moon’s rays the way someone might welcome the sun’s warmth after a rainstorm. The others followed suit, raising their hands to the moon as if praising it. Then they produced small flasks from within their robes. The leader took his to the bubbling vat behind him. He lifted a large iron ladle from the vat, filled it with the foul goldenrod liquid, and poured it into his vial with a doctor’s precision. It bubbled a little more as he stirred the vat with his ladle, refreshing the sulfur stench in the air. He extended his arm to the other hooded figures. They stepped forward, one by one, to have him fill their own flasks. When everyone had taken from the vat, they returned to their positions to face the man on the platform. Then each one drew back his hood. I leaned forward and squinted at the leader. 253 And stared at the handsome features and piercing eyes of Duke Leopold Laurent. Duke Laurent, Papa’s influential friend. The man who bent down to smile at me after Jacque Denue’s friends attacked me, to ask if I was all right. The man who held a banquet to honor Francois, for his bravery in killing the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie. A banquet from which Francois went home drunk, escorted by the Duke’s men, to be devoured by a pack of wolves that same night. As if by coincidence. Or by design. Duke Laurent, who made an appearance at every funeral of every person killed by the wolves. Who railed against the King for ignoring his letters, in which he begged the court to send soldiers to rescue us. Letters he never truly sent. Laurent. I clenched my jaw and tensed my shoulders to keep from shaking the surrounding straw. Laurent spread his arms to the crowd. “My brothers. I know you have concerns about the men we lost last night, and the red-cloaked rider who killed them. I assure you, we will find him, whoever he is, and make him suffer. As to how he did it, I have sent word to the Prime, and I will let you know his conclusions once I receive them. You have my word.” I bit my lip, seething. His word. “Meanwhile, I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty has accepted my invitation.” This brought a cheerful murmur of approval and a few joyful shouts. Laurent waved down their 254 excitement with his hands. “So do not be distracted by last night’s incident. It is of little consequence, and in another month, will amount to nothing. So let us celebrate these fresh kills from our two newest initiates, and the strength they will soon share with us. Not to mention sharing in our glorious destiny. Soon all of our patience will be rewarded. Let us drink to that.” A few men laughed. Duke Laurent held up his flask with two hands, as if it was a precious infant. The other men followed suit. Laurent tipped his head back and they all drank. He winced as if it tasted bitter, but then licked his lips to savor it, like a drunkard sucking down stale alcohol solely for its effect. He stepped forward to stand directly beneath the skylight. The moon shone on his face as he closed his eyes with a look of rapture. He shed the black robe from his shoulders, revealing that he was completely naked. I nearly gasped, but kept quiet in spite of my shock. Then Duke Laurent’s face began to change. His strange grin pulled back at the corners of his mouth and somehow kept pulling, widening his lips. At the same time, his ears seemed to stretch away from his jaws, and moved impossibly up toward the top of his head. His nose grew larger, lengthening like that of a dog and extending over his chest. Gray hair sprouted from his cheeks, forehead and chest as he hunched forward. He fell to his hands and knees and I saw a bushy tail grow and lift from behind his back. His arms and legs narrowed while his hands and feet thickened and 255 grew into animal paws. He crouched on the floor of the barn and opened his fiery eyes, grinning again to display canine fangs. Laurent had become one of the six-foot wolves I fought at Favreau’s farm. The Lycanthru weren’t simply worshiping wolves. They were the wolves! 256 28. Seeing Duke Laurent transform into a wolf from my secret overhead perch, I inhaled with a sudden squeak, unable to stop myself. The four robed men standing at different corners of the hayloft turned sharp eyes on me. The nearest one clawed through the hay and seized my wrist. Before I could think, he yanked me from my hiding place for all to see. Straw and dust fell from my cloak like a rainshower. “It’s him!” he shouted. “It’s the red rider!” 257 He tugged me toward himself again as Laurent – in his horrid wolf-form – gaped up at us with bulging eyes. Others also turned toward us, while the other men in the hayloft ran at me. I kicked at my captor’s shin and he groaned, clutching his knee. I grabbed a pitchfork set against the wall and turned it on another man as he rushed at me, thrusting its tines at him twice. He backed away and lost his balance, falling from the loft onto the crowd below. The other two paused before continuing toward me. I couldn’t fend them both off at once. I turned back toward the hay pile where I had hidden. I shoved at it with the pitchfork, forcing the heavy pile out the loading door. I pushed myself out into the cool night air, the thick clumps of hay beneath me. I landed hard on the cushion of hay and rolled onto the grass, my side aching from the impact. Thankfully, the previous night’s rain had softened the ground enough to ease my fall. I whistled for Crimson as angry shouts grew within the barn, and the cultists rushed toward the front door. Crimson galloped straight at me, as if the barn’s rising chaos helped him to sense my need. I stood and grabbed the horn of his saddle, letting his momentum propel me up onto him as the door flew open and the Lycanthru poured out. I glanced back as we charged for the trees. The men stood outside the barn, gulping down liquid from their flasks and removing their black robes. I barely glimpsed their naked bodies crouching low to the ground and changing like 258 Duke Laurent did. Becoming an army of enormous wolves that bounded after me with nerve-rattling snarls. We raced deep into the forest. I drove Crimson harder, pounding past dark pine trees. The welcome cover of branches and leaves gave little comfort, since the Lycanthru wolves would know the terrain as well as I did. Hearing sharp growls, I turned to see three wolves closing in. I leaned against Crimson, having no way to fire the repeating crossbow with one hand while riding. Instead, I drew my father’s crossbow, already cocked. Slow and steady, keeping a sure grip as we galloped on. I took aim at the tan wolf nearing Crimson’s heels and fired, praying I was right about the silver. The bolt struck his flank, behind his head. A clumsy shot. Yet he fell to the ground with wide-eyed surprise. The other two wolves scrambled past him. One glanced back at the dead wolf twice, seeming confused that the creature didn’t rise. So much for my doubts. I had just killed a man. A man who could transform himself into a wolf. My fist clenched the reins tighter. The other two wolves quickened their pace. I leaned forward in the saddle to draw another bolt from my satchel bag. I loaded it and carefully lowered the crossbow’s strap to my right stirrup, my body in rhythm with Crimson’s stride. After looping the strap under my boot, I yanked up on it 259 to cock the bow. I turned as a wolf opened its jaws to nip at Crimson’s hind leg. I fired straight into its skull and it slumped to the ground. The third wolf watched its companion collapse, and his rushing gait faltered for a moment. I re-loaded and cocked the crossbow as I glimpsed more wolves, perhaps eight of them, approaching from the distant fog behind me. I shot the third wolf in his neck and he spun to the mud. They would reach me in less than a minute. I could never hold them off with my few remaining bolts. I pushed Crimson harder, clinging to him as we surged forward, heading for who-knew-where. I had to find an escape, somewhere. Anywhere. Anywhere to hide from these beasts that were once men! Father Vestille was right about how dangerous the Lycanthru were, just as Pierre was right about my hood, now a bright red flag drawing the wolves straight toward me. A sudden inspiration struck me. I slid Papa’s crossbow back into place behind the saddle and grabbed the repeating crossbow, slinging its strap over my shoulder. Then I untied my cloak with one hand. The wind blew the hood wide as I pulled it against Crimson’s neck and secured it to the reins. I pushed the flapping cloak from my face and looped the crossbow strap over my neck, then gripped the reins in my left hand as I drew my grappling hook. I flicked its prongs open and let the hook dangle at my hip. 260 I spotted a thick tree limb, the kind I needed, and swung the hook toward its base. It looped under the branch and locked in place as I gave Crimson a final prod and a shout. Then I lifted my heels and held tight to the rope, tugging myself out of the stirrups. I curved up under the limb as Crimson fled beneath me. He paused and glanced back, but I shouted again for him to keep going. He obeyed, confused, but slowed to a trot, refusing to stray too far as I scrambled up the rope. We had gained enough distance that the wolves wouldn’t see me climbing in the dark fog. At least, I hoped they wouldn’t. I hoisted myself onto the limb, straining to wrap my leg around it. I straddled the branch in time to see the wolves approaching. They stared straight ahead, focused on Crimson and the flapping cloak. I slid the repeating crossbow strap off my shoulder and took aim. Pierre had melted down enough material to load it with ten bolts, all tipped with silver. I fired at the three closest wolves as they rushed toward my tree, plugging each one. They dropped to the ground and lay silent. The silver worked. I fired at two more oncoming wolves, who broke their stride to view their fallen companions. Once struck, they lay a few feet past them in a heap. The other wolves slowed their rush. Some stopped altogether and hunched, twisting their necks toward the surrounding trees. I fired at the two in front, dropping them where they stood. 261 The rear wolves backed up a few paces. Some turned and fled. An auburn wolf growled back at them. “Cowards!” he shouted in a guttural voice. My blood ran cold. It was true, what I heard as a child. The wolves could speak. Men who could turn into wolves, but still think and speak like men. And they had organized themselves into a small army to attack the people of La Rue Sauvage. To attack families and their children. Why? I dismissed my questions for the moment. I had three bolts left. More than a dozen wolves remained below. If I took out their leader – the auburn wolf shouting at the ones who fled – then the others might back down. He still faced them while the other wolves paused in the clearing, shifting from side to side and looking uncertainly at one another. I took aim at his head, just below the pointed ear. He charged back toward the other wolves as I fired. “Come bac–!” he growled as my bolt sank into the tree trunk behind him. The wolves froze. I trembled, trying not to give away my position. Two bolts left. “There!” the auburn wolf snarled. “He’s up there!” The others padded a few steps back. Perhaps to get a better angle. Perhaps out of genuine fear. I focused on the auburn wolf but he bounded away before I could fire again, toward the 262 wolves that escaped. I puzzled over that while the rest of the pack shifted back and forth in the muddy ground. I worked to slow my breathing. Where had the auburn wolf gone? Had he run off to gather reinforcements from the barn? I couldn’t last long against them all, and I couldn’t wait them out until daybreak. I had to use every small advantage I had. Such as the fact that wolves couldn’t climb trees. Something snarled and rushed from behind the other wolves, who parted to make way for it. The auburn wolf charged between them, sprinting madly at the tree trunk where my bolt had embedded itself. He leaped at the tree and bounded off it to jump higher at another tree near me. He struck that trunk and sprang from it, launching himself at me like a flying nightmare, his jaws wide. I noted that normal wolves can’t climb trees, while I fired as a reflex, sinking my last two bolts into the auburn wolf’s mouth and gut. The beast spun backward in mid-air and twirled to the ground. It hit the earth like a sack of potatoes and lay dead. No bolts left. The others stared at the fallen animal and glanced at one another, shifting their paws. But they didn’t leave. Some fixed their eyes on the auburn wolf. Others backed away, ready to run. A few growled up at me. I turned toward a shuffling sound farther up the path, as the wolves also turned. Between the leaves, over the bushes, I could see Crimson’s 263 head as he trotted back and forth. He had insisted on staying close. I whistled for him. Time to escape, if we could. The wolves glanced in all directions. Crimson bounded through the trees, the red cloak wafting behind him like a soldier’s flag. The wolves backed away. “There are two of them!” one snarled. “Run!” growled another. Half the pack turned and sprinted away as I watched, amazed. It wasn’t just Crimson that startled them. They withdrew at the sight of my hooded cloak. The remaining wolves lost their courage and ran as Crimson charged at them. Ran from the sight of my red hood. I swallowed, releasing a hard breath. I shimmied down the rope as Crimson drew near, then jumped onto his saddle and kicked at him, leaving the grappling hook behind. I could retrieve it tomorrow. Or Pierre could make me another one. We galloped toward Father Vestille’s hovel, kicking up mud and leaves, Crimson’s hooves pounding with the rhythm of my heart. I steadied my heartbeat, gathering my thoughts. Everything had suddenly become clear, in one horrifying night. One horrifying hour. The wolves spoke. I had not imagined it. The wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie had spoken to unsettle me. He never expected me to survive and expose his strange ability. The Lycanthru were transforming themselves into wolves to attack people, led by Duke Laurent. 264 But I had discovered their weakness. The slightest touch of silver killed them. They now feared me. Feared my red hood. I thanked the Lord for revealing everything to me, my senses surging with relief and rage as we rushed through the frigid night. Everything became so clear. I could stop them. I could kill them all. 265 266 267 MY WAR 268 269 29. We emerged from the seclusion of the forest pines and trotted into the clearing where Father Vestille’s hovel sat. Nestled deep in the woods, his home was easy to reach and easy to maneuver from. Riding all the way into the village was out of the question, now that I knew the Lycanthru’s secrets. They would hunt me down. I could never use Pierre’s loft again. I tried to settle my racing heart. I had found the Lycanthru. And discovered Duke Laurent leading them. I still saw the image of his face 270 beneath that monstrous wolf-hood, standing before the cult that was terrorizing the province. Still saw Laurent and the other men drink that foul sulfurous liquid and transform themselves into enormous wolves. I shook off my fears. Silver would destroy them. I could destroy them. I had to keep my courage. More important, I had to keep myself hidden so I could rest. No one could know that I had anything to do with Father Vestille anymore. Or all of our lives would be forfeit. I led Crimson to the stable behind the stone hovel and surveyed the area for any witnesses. Then I kicked aside straw and lifted the secret door to Father Vestille’s underground sanctuary. I checked again for any sign of movement from the surrounding trees, then led Crimson down the ramp. He could fill up on oats and bed down for the night. I lit a candle and found the underground room much cleaner. No more cobwebs or dust clouds, and only a faint lingering odor of mold. Father Vestille must have spent a good part of his day making this place into a home. I swallowed. Could I ever again have a place to call home? Yet Father Vestille did his best to provide one, without even knowing whether I would return. I stepped back up the ramp to pull the top door shut, then got Crimson settled. Once he lay on the straw pile – much larger and fresher than last night – and closed his eyes, I climbed up the ladder and knocked on the trap door. I heard Father Vestille’s muffled voice and some quick shuffling overhead. 271 I was growing so accustomed to this night life, the life of a nocturnal beast, that I had forgotten normal people still retired to their beds well before midnight. “Helena?” Father Vestille called in a harsh whisper from above as he creaked across the floorboards. I pushed the door up and climbed into the warm candlelight of his front room. He stood there in his nightshirt, holding the candle on its tray. His anxious eyes were bloodshot. “I’m here,” I said. “Crimson’s settled for the night.” I stepped up into the room and eased the door shut. He deserved far more explanation of my activities, but I acted as though I had said all that was necessary. I couldn’t expect him to understand. He accepted it, clearing his throat. “Do you – Have you had anything to eat?” My pride urged me to lie and say I didn’t need anything. But my more practical stomach growled. “I’ll get you some bread,” Father Vestille said. “I still have some cheese and lamb from tonight’s supper. I hoped you might return.” He shuffled away to his table. I followed slowly as he unwrapped the remains of bread from a cloth in a round basket, then unwrapped some cold lamb and hunks of cheese from another platter. He looked at me, somewhat abashed. “I can light the fire again to heat this up.” 272 I shook my head. I didn’t want him to have to do anything more. Nor would it be wise to send up chimney smoke from his hovel after midnight, with the Lycanthru searching for me. I shuddered and clutched my shoulders. “It’s fine. Thank you.” I grabbed the meat and tore off a chunk with my teeth. I had not eaten for hours and the excitement in the forest only made me more ravenous. I was well into my second bite when I noticed Father Vestille staring at me with concern. I realized I had failed to give thanks again. I stopped chewing in mid-stride and bowed my head to thank the Lord for the food. For this place. For my life. Whatever might be left of it. I opened my eyes to find him still staring. Perhaps he was less worried about my prayers than for my half-starved condition. “Can I get you anything else? Do you need to bathe again? I can wait out here, or outside if you like.” I shook my head and chewed. I had to discuss tonight’s events with someone, and quickly. Even if it had to be Father Vestille. Before it was too late. “Father Vestille,” I began, then finished chewing. “… Something happened tonight.” He stood listening. Then he turned and pulled up a stool to sit before me. I sat in the chair by his table. It felt good to sit. To do something normal and safe. To imagine I could be safe again someday. I swallowed and lowered my eyes. “I saw them. The Lycanthru. I saw them all.” 273 His voice rose in a panic as he gripped my shoulders. “Helena. Are you all right?” I nodded. I didn’t shake him off. It felt good to be held, the closest thing to an embrace that I would experience for some time. My entire life had changed in a few days. In one terrifying night. I could never be the same person again. I could never again enjoy a feeling of safety or home or family. “There were several men, wearing robes. With images of wolves on them. They performed some sort of ritual. And – they changed into animals.” I met his eyes, which held horror but no disbelief. “Father Vestille. They’re the wolves that have been attacking everyone. They become wolves.” Father Vestille stared at me, then swallowed hard. “Are you all right?” he asked again. I gave a small nod. “Did they see you?” I felt cold inside. “Yes. They chased me. I shot a few of them.” “You shot them?” He seemed equally horrified. “Yes,” I said, offended. “It was wise at the time.” He sighed with some irritation. “Go on.” “Never mind,” I said, starting to rise. He remained in his stool and put a hand on my shoulder. His eyes were penitent. “Please.” I fumed for a moment, then sat back down. “I saw their leader. He removed his hood to drink 274 some potion that changed him into a wolf.” I swallowed. “It was Duke Leopold Laurent.” Father Vestille’s eyes widened. He continued to glare at me for several seconds. “The other day,” he muttered. I squinted at him. “What day?” He looked off, grinding his teeth. “The day your – your mother and Suzette – were killed. Duke Laurent invited me to his chateau for a talk.” My nerves flared with rage. “About what?” He set his jaw, narrowing his eyes. “To see how your family was faring. After the loss of your father.” I gasped and shook. Laurent had planned every attack. The banquet to make Francois drunk while Laurent’s own friends surrounded him at the tavern, waiting to strike at his home later that night. Then luring Father Vestille away from Mama and Suzette so the Lycanthru could murder them in broad daylight. Laurent. “Helena. I’m glad you choose to confide in me, but – why, exactly, are you telling me all this now?” I shivered. We both knew I had pushed him away for years, rejected his every offer of help or friendship. “Someone needs to know,” I said. “I can’t be the only one. Someone else needs to know, in case …” I broke off, uncertain how to finish. He finished for me, his eyes wide. “In case anything should happen to you.” He rose and turned away, frustrated. “I told you the Lycanthru 275 were dangerous. And if the Duke of La Rue Sauvage is involved –.” I stood and leaned toward him. “He’s not just involved. He’s leading them!” “Leading them against you!” he said. “Because you challenged them. Because you sought them out and found them.” “I can’t change what I’ve already done.” “But what will you do now? Will you go on fighting them? Killing them? These are not animals, Helena. They’re human beings.” “They’re not animals, and they’re not human beings. They left their humanity behind to become these things.” “You can tell yourself that if you wish. It’s still murder.” “This is a war!” “A war you started.” “No. A war they started. They’re killing innocent people. Innocent children! And you want me to let them!” “You know I don’t want that.” “I don’t know what you want. You want to help me. You want to shelter me and care for me. But you don’t want me to fight the things that killed my family.” He strode at me. “Because I don’t want them to kill you, too!” We held one another’s gaze for a moment. He was shaking. “I don’t want them to, either,” I said quietly. “But I can’t let them take any more children. Ever again.” 276 He struggled to calm himself, unable to respond. He knew what I felt, having hidden my family away during the war. But it seemed he had forgotten how to take risks to protect innocent people. “Helena. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. But I’m worried. Not just for your physical well-being, but also for your soul. If you wage this war, I fear for what you might become.” My stomach churned. He was like a man with a musket who refused to fire at the predators on his doorstep. “If you’re that concerned about what I’ll become, I can find another place to stay, so you won’t be burdened.” As I folded my arms and stepped away, I realized I felt something more than disgust at his cowardice. I feared he might be right. If I kept on fighting these monsters, could I become just as cold-hearted and bloodthirsty? Would I become the scar-faced monster that Jacque Denue and his cronies feared? “You are no burden,” Father Vestille insisted. “You can stay here for as long as you wish. I will gladly shelter you and feed you, and give you whatever you need to live a full and rewarding life. But I cannot help you kill.” I kept my back to him. I couldn’t expect a priest to help me kill anyone, beast or not. It seemed he was doing everything for me that his faith would allow. Which made me question my own faith. Was I truly seeking justice or merely revenge? Yet how could I let them ravage our people, our world, while I retreated into a safe, 277 warm house and pretended there were no monsters outside my door? When I could do something to stop it. I turned to face him. “Right now, what I need most is your confidence in me.” “I have every confidence in you, Helena,” he said. “But I cannot help you take up a sword. I might as well be putting it to your throat. It will only end in death.” I kept my body rigid. I couldn’t let him know the fear I felt, or let him put any of his own fear into me. I had no choice but to fight these beasts. Except to retreat, and wait to die. I lifted my chin. “Then let’s say we understand one another, and agree to disagree on what must be done.” He looked sad and distant, as if I were his own daughter leaving home, never to return. As though he was mourning the loss of my soul. I prayed he would be wrong. “I will accept that, for now,” he said. “I only want to help you, Helena. You’re all the – You are the only one left from your family. I don’t wish to lose you, too.” “I’ll do everything I can to see that you don’t. I promise.” He glanced aside, shuffled his foot, cleared his throat. “Come. Finish your supper and you can get some rest.” I followed him to the table without another word and did as he said, like a condemned man marching to the gallows. 278 Crimson woke before me. He stood in the darkness, where stripes of light shone through the cracks in Father Vestille’s floorboards above us. I ignored both Crimson and the light and shut my eyes, drifting back into a swallowing sleep. I woke perhaps an hour later, feeling refreshed and stronger. I sat up on the cot and had an odd feeling. A feeling of freedom and security. Of home. The underground cellar held little light or fresh air, but it was safer than any place where I could take refuge above ground. Where the wolves reigned. I stood to my feet and stretched. I wore one of Father Vestille’s old nightshirts, which hung down to my knees. But it kept me warm through the night, along with the blanket, and helped me feel human again for the few hours I slept. I looked about for my clothes. Then I remembered Father Vestille had offered to scrub them clean for me, despite my protests. I smiled now at the thought of him with a basin of soapy water and a washboard, working away at the filth on my pants. The pants he was embarrassed for me to wear in public, as anyone would be. The pants I wore to move freely enough to kill the wolves, which deeply disturbed him. Yet he cleaned them for me, despite his discomfort with my new life. It almost felt like having parents again. Someone to care for me. To accept and support me, even if he didn’t agree with my choices. I started toward the ladder to retrieve my clothes. Then I found them right in front of me, 279 folded in a basket at the foot of the ladder, along with my cloak and boots. The basket had a rope tied to its handles, which lay in a heap beside it. He had finished the work and lowered the container to the floor, mindful of my modesty by not entering the room. He was a good man. Better than I had thought, while he cared for Mama and Suzette over the past several months. Better than I treated him. Still, for all he had done to help us during the war and for all he did to shelter me now, he had still abandoned us when we needed him most. When I needed him most. After the wolf attacked, we needed courage and guidance, but he was away visiting other provinces, other churches. Seeking his own escape instead of facing them down, however he could. If he wanted to help me now, I would gladly accept it, but I couldn’t forget the past. I sighed and grunted. I had no time to mourn his choices. From the look of the sunrays filtering from upstairs and my well-rested state, it was already midday. Only a few hours left to report last night’s events to Pierre before darkness set in again. I reached for my clothes and carried them to the cot with my cloak and boots. Time to set to work. 280 30. L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne smelled of rich oil and fire from the day’s work, nearly over now as dusk approached. Monsieur Leóne was away again, delivering special orders and securing more material. Pierre could not stop gaping at me for the entire time I told my tale. The events of last night – the Lycanthru, their ability to speak, the clear effect of the silver bolts, their new fear of my hood – every detail enthralled him. I told him everything, except for two significant details. 281 “Where did you go afterward?” he asked. I curled my lip. “I can’t tell you that.” He blinked, wounded. “Why not?” “Pierre, I trust you and I value your help. But I can’t reveal everything that I’m doing. Just trust that I’ve found shelter.” “But why can’t you stay here? You’re welcome to sleep in the loft anytime you want.” I touched his hand to show my gratitude. “I know. But I can’t let anyone find me here, or find you. Too many people know I’ve visited you before. That alone places you in danger. And I can’t let anything – I don’t want to endanger you any further.” His brows curved up with hurt, but he nodded his understanding. “Did you see any of them?” I blinked. “The wolves?” “The Lycanthru. Did you see any of their faces? Recognize anyone?” I stared blankly at him, imagining his obvious emotions on display as one of the Lycanthru – perhaps Duke Laurent himself – questioned him. I pictured the Lycanthru seeing through Pierre’s attempts to protect me as he claimed to know nothing. I saw them seize him by the throat and drag him deep into the woods where their mouths would transform into hungry jaws. “No,” I said. “I never saw their faces. I don’t know who any of them are.” Pierre frowned. “Too bad.” He locked his gaze on me. “Especially if they know who you are.” 282 “They don’t. Yet,” I assured him. “But they will.” “Red, don’t do anything dangerous.” I blinked at him. “I think it’s too late for that.” “Anything more dangerous than you’ve already done,” he clarified, sounding annoyed. “If you keep after them, they’re going to come after you. And they’ll find you.” “I don’t think so,” I said, thinking of the safety of Father Vestille’s hideaway. Wondering how long it might remain safe. “In any event, they’ll be searching for me already, don’t you think?” Pierre swallowed hard. “Of course. You saw them. Saw what they do. They won’t let that pass.” I nodded. “Which means I’ve got to stop them first.” “Red, you can’t! These people – these monsters, whatever they are – how can you stop them? You don’t even know who they are or where to look for them next.” “I know where to start.” “All right. Then I’m coming with you.” “No, you’re not.” “Come on, Red. How do you expect to stop me from following you? You know I’m a faster rider.” “I know.” I sighed and turned toward the other work table beside us, wishing I could take him along and lean on his help. But it would mean exposing him to the Lycanthru and marking him 283 for death, the way I had been marked. “Forgive me later?” I asked. He squinted, confused. “For what?” I struck his jaw hard and he spun in a half-circle on his way to the ground. Thankfully, his head missed the edge of the oak table. I dropped the heavy chunk of lead back on the work table, where I had just snatched it. I shook my stinging hand as I stared at Pierre’s quiet body lying on the floor, hoping the lead punch wouldn’t leave much of a bruise. I wanted to embrace him, stroke his head, thank him for his endless support and care. Instead, I had knocked him unconscious. I kept staring at him, wishing I was a different person. Someone he could love and be happy with. But I wasn’t. The Lord had assigned me a strange destiny, however short-lived it might be. To stop as many of these murdering creatures as I could. Before they finally killed me, too. I blew Pierre a silent kiss, hoping he truly would forgive me as I asked. For what I had done and for whatever I was becoming. I stepped over him and headed out the door. 284 31. The same hush fell over the crowd of swaying onlookers as I entered La Maison tavern, crossbow in hand. Before I pushed through the heavy doors, they were joking, shouting, jostling one another. Now they all fixed a silent gaze on me before quietly returning to their drinks and murmured discussions, stealing glances at me over their shoulders and cupped hands. No one risked speaking to me, perhaps fearing my wrath, or being otherwise drawn into my dangerous world. 285 Touraine eyed me from the bar as well, ending his conversations and shooing people away. He turned his back to me as I approached and took a seat on the stool. “Order a drink,” he muttered. I considered reminding him that his tavern refused to serve young girls, but this was no time to make sport. People were watching us. I laid my crossbow on the counter. “Monsieur,” I said, as if I was seizing his attention. He turned. “A glass of your best wine, if you please.” He soured. “Buttermilk it is,” he said, reaching below the counter. I frowned. He had not forgotten, after all. “Just put some water in a mug. And make it look dangerous.” He took a new mug and pitcher, turning his back to me again. “You had another busy night.” “Very busy. You heard of it, then?” “Heard there was a hunt. Heard some men found a pile of dead wolves out in the woods. Large ones. But no one knows who found them, and there’s nothing there anymore.” I narrowed my eyes. “Nothing there? Then how do they know there were any wolves there in the first place?” Touraine bowed his head, pretending he needed to polish a mug with his rag. “A rumor. Some claim they saw that red rider fighting wolves in the forest. They say he left a few there, dead. But they’re gone now. Others say that’s just a rumor spread by some drunkards. What do you say?” 286 He handed me the mug and I drank, wondering how to pretend it was alcoholic. I decided to drink it slowly, staring at the counter while he pretended to ignore me. I lowered my voice. “It’s no rumor. I assume someone started talking about last night’s events until they were ordered to keep silent.” I took another sip of water. “Have those men been back tonight? The ones who love hearing about wolf attacks?” “Same place as always. They’re calmer tonight, though, maybe because Duke Laurent joined them. He made a rare appearance.” My nerves flared. I turned to see them, gathered around their usual table. Lieutenant-General Sharrad sat near the head, with his gleaming blue-gray eyes. Duke Leopold Laurent was seated beside him, like a spider at the center of its web. The Duke’s royal advisor, Simonet, sat in the next chair, wearing his usual callous expression. They all studied me with violent disdain. I grabbed my crossbow and rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle?” Touraine asked, turning suddenly. “Mademoiselle, where are you going?” he demanded in a whisper. Once more secured, the crossbow hung at my hip as I strode toward the table. The table where the Lycanthru gathered to celebrate their victories after attacking people in the village. After chewing on the flesh of innocent mothers and fathers and five-year old girls. My boots clomped across the floorboards as I marched at them, my 287 cloak rippling behind me. They set down their drinks and sat taller, their backs rigid, their attention focused. Nearby observers shrank back, hunching over their drinks, eager to avoid us. I stood before the Lycanthru and stared straight at Laurent. No one moved. Duke Laurent squinted, confused. He blinked in surprise. “Helena?” A strange smile twisted across his lips. “Is that Helena Basque beneath that hood?” He recognized my scars across the lower half of my face. I no longer cared. I grabbed a nearby chair and slid it to the end of the table, opposite Laurent. I sat, with all eyes on me, as I lifted my hands to draw back the hood, revealing my face and blonde hair. Their eyes bulged in an odd mixture of horror and delight. They seemed outraged to discover their adversary was a mere girl. Yet they seemed all the more eager to take their revenge, now that they had seen my face. “So,” Laurent said, breaking the thick silence. “I haven’t seen you since – oh, yes. Since your little sister’s funeral.” Blood surged through my neck and temples. I wanted to lunge across the table and strangle him. But I could do nothing here, with so many witnesses. People who only knew Duke Laurent as I once did: a generous benefactor to our tiny community, a man we were all blessed to have leading us. He was a true wolf in sheep’s clothing. 288 Seeing he had rattled me, he continued to study my reactions with measured calm. I couldn’t let him unsettle me again. “Well,” he went on. “… What new things have you been up to lately?” I stiffened my posture. “A lot of hunting. Late at night.” Scorn lined every face around the table. I could almost feel, almost smell, their hatred of me. Even Simonet narrowed his eyes with bitterness. I was only a girl, but they wanted to destroy me at least as much as I wanted to destroy them. Laurent twisted his lip. “So I hear.” “So you witnessed,” I said. “From your platform.” The men around the table drew a sharp intake of breath. Sharrad bared his teeth, looking so savage I thought he might spring for my throat. Laurent fingered his mug, lifted it and drank. Then he continued to study me. “You seem to have learned a lot in one night.” “Not enough. I know what you are. What you become. But I don’t know which of you attacked me, or which of you banded together to kill Francois Revelier. Or the rest of my family.” Laurent squinted at me, cockeyed. “You’re accusing us of attacking you, Helena? And of killing your woodcutter friend? Forgive me, but I thought you were both attacked by a wolf. Isn’t that the story you’ve been telling everyone? Weren’t you attacked by a big, bad wolf?” The men snickered. 289 Laurent continued, like the ringmaster of a traveling circus troupe. “If you change your story now and say you were attacked by a man – well, I’m not sure how many people will believe you.” “There were witnesses.” “Oh?” Laurent asked in a mocking tone, as if this was new information. “Where are they now? Was that woodcutter one of them? Or your Grand’Mere? Or your Papa?” Hot blood filled my temples. Laurent folded his hands, satisfied. “Seems you’re the only one left to tell your tale, Helena. And reasonable people don’t often listen to hysterical little girls who lose their temper at funerals and refuse to associate with anyone. Especially when they take to dressing in men’s clothes and running through the woods late at night, hunting for witches and big bad wolves.” The others burst into laughter, except for Simonet. He continued to watch me with reserved eyes. I waited for the others to finish their mindless chuckles. “I’m not interested in exposing your dirty secret activities.” “No? Then how can I help you, Mademoiselle?” My cheek twitched, but I kept my body rigid. “I only want our province, once and for all, to be rid of you.” They stared at me in stunned silence. Then exploded into laughter. One man actually wiped tears from his eyes while attempting to regain his composure. 290 Laurent looked over the heads of his comrades and smiled. Other raucous conversations had resumed behind us, drowning out whatever was said at our table. Laurent smiled at the group and leaned forward. “Mademoiselle, let us be honest. You’ve done very well. You struck at us and actually did some damage. I’m not so proud that I cannot admit you beat us down. Twice. So you have my respect and admiration, and I congratulate you.” His grin hardened into stone. “And now it’s over. You cannot seriously hope to ‘rid’ your little province of me. Or the rest of our order, which happens to hold eighty-eight members. All with the same abilities that my friends and I share.” I tensed my back and shoulders, keeping my lips impassive. I couldn’t let him know he frightened me. “Eighty-eight? Still?” He grinned, seeming genuinely amused. “I apologize. You have reduced our ranks down to, what? Seventy-five? Yet as I see it – seventy-five to one? I think we can still rely on our numbers.” “Rely on them while you have them.” Laurent leaned forward again, incredulous. “So you’re serious, are you, Helena? You intend to take us all on?” I said nothing. He kept his eyes on me as he leaned toward Simonet. “Tell me what you see, Simonet.” I met Simonet’s cold eyes, which seemed to pierce my soul. “She’s passionate in her position, Your Grace. Unfortunately for her, she has no real plan. 291 She might continue to do damage, but she knows she won’t last long.” I tried to steel myself against all fear. To keep him from seeing it. Laurent turned to his right. “What do you think, Sharrad? Does she look serious?” Sharrad locked his gaze on me. His thin lips spread in a cruel smile. “I think she looks delicious.” His stare burned into me until I could actually feel his hunger. “You don’t frighten me,” I told him, stiffening my shoulders to convince myself. “You killed my Grand’Mere and you scared me in the tunnel when I was a child. But you won’t frighten me again.” Laurent squinted and exchanged looks of confusion with Simonet and Sharrad. “You think that Lieutenant-General Sharrad killed your Grand’Mere?” “I recognize his eyes.” Laurent seemed to understand, but acted as if I had said something amusing, while Sharrad’s nostrils flared. “Helena, dear. The wolf that killed your Grand’Mere is dead. Your friend, the woodcutter, killed him with an ax. That was not Vigo Sharrad, the head of our police force. Tell her who it was, Vigo.” Sharrad’s blue-gray eyes blazed. “That was my brother, Gustave.” I shuddered, while Laurent grinned with malice. It was Sharrad’s brother, with the same unsettling eyes. 292 “And tell her what you’ve wanted to do since that day, Vigo.” Sharrad twitched, as if wanting to pounce on me. “To devour the one who killed him. Which we did, a few years back. And to finish the job Gustave started.” “He means you, my dear,” Laurent said with delight. “Helena, consider what you’re getting yourself into. I’m willing to forget these recent incidents and we can part ways. I don’t expect us to remain friends, but if you walk away now, I promise you’ll live.” “No guarantee from me,” Sharrad said. Laurent put up a hand to quiet him. “I can keep our order in line, Helena. Including our honorable Lieutenant-General. Out of respect for your achievements – and your considerable losses – I can ensure your survival. However, if you continue this reckless endeavor …” He raised his hands in surrender. “There is little I can do to protect you. You can see how angry my friends are. I believe they want your blood.” “Blood, flesh and bone,” another man snarled beside me, his hair and eyes wild. “So as the last living member of your family,” Laurent continued. “If you place any value on your life at all, you’ll take this chance now to leave, unharmed. Otherwise, I cannot be certain what will happen to you.” He seemed to expect me to believe his lies, the way Papa did. I no longer bothered to hide the trembling throughout my body, even from Simonet. Despite my fear, I now shook with 293 something else: rage. “Nothing is ever certain in La Rue Sauvage, Monsieur Laurent. Except death.” I pushed the chair away and stood. My cloak whirled behind me as I strode toward the door. “Where are you going now, little girl?” Sharrad called across the room. I spun back at them, the blood filling my cheeks as they laughed. Sharrad meant to unnerve me, using the same words the black wolf had used. His own brother, the Lycanthru with shining eyes who killed my Grand’Mere and left me scarred. They wanted to remind me that, after all these years, I would not find anyone to believe my reports about them. About men who changed into talking wolves and threatened to gobble up little girls in the night. They meant to remind me that I was completely alone in my fight against them. But I already knew that. I raised the repeating crossbow to my shoulder and they abruptly froze, falling dead silent. Two of them shrank back. Other conversations stopped abruptly around the large room. “Hunting,” I said flatly. Everyone in the tavern watched me, with what might have been awe or revulsion. Either way, it was mixed with fear, which was what I needed. I had made the Lycanthru afraid. If the rest of the town feared me as well, so be it. I stepped outside and mounted Crimson, anxious to ride off and get my shaking under control. They had unnerved me, but I had also 294 unnerved them. I simply needed to focus on quieting my fears and unleashing my anger. They would remain in the tavern, deliberating over how to deal with me. I would have to be even more cautious about my contact with Touraine and Pierre, to keep them from linking us to one another. Which left me even more alone. I had no choice. I knew what I had to do. What I alone could do. I had destroyed a handful of them. There were seventy-five Lycanthru left. I would start keeping count. I rode hard into the open plain and galloped toward the forest. 295 32. Over the next two months, I fought the wolves, beat them down, struck fear into their hearts. In the waning hours of the night, I snatched one person after another from their jaws. Killed one wolf after another with a silver bolt. Until the whole village knew that someone was fighting for them, and had started to refer to me by the name the wolves had given me: The Red Rider. I couldn’t get at Duke Laurent, but I had reduced his numbers, and I could feel his rage at 296 every wolf I struck down. Knowing I would not give up. Knowing I was thinning his ranks. I continued to take refuge in the underground longhouse beneath Father Vestille’s hovel, while I received secret supplies from Pierre and secret information from Touraine. Though I had to maintain greater caution, now that people were watching me more closely, both wolves and villagers alike. And I had no way of knowing for certain which of the villagers might secretly be wolves. Tonight, Crimson waited for me in a thicket of trees near La Maison, keeping out of sight, while I stole through back alleys toward the rear of the tavern. After waiting for what felt like ages, I seized an opportunity to cross the street, using a passing carriage to hide from onlookers. Then I rushed to the cellar door, yanked it open and dropped inside, finding a basement corridor that led to the recessed storage area. I waited even longer in the wine cellar itself, though I felt far more secure within the quiet room, free of witnesses. Finally, Gerard Touraine descended the steps to the corridor and entered the wine cellar with his lantern. “Monsieur Touraine,” I whispered. He whirled about, wrinkling his brows as he held up the lantern. His face softened as he recognized my hood, hiding behind the wine shelves. “Mademoiselle? Is that you?” “Are you alone?” 297 He glanced over his shoulder on instinct, but there were no other footsteps. “Yes. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in over a week.” “I know. I’ve been finding information elsewhere. It’s safer that way.” He pursed his lips, understanding but looking disappointed. “So why are you here now?” “To see what you know. What you’ve heard. It’s not the safest, but it’s still the best. I haven’t heard much information lately, but I didn’t want to endanger you any more than I had to. I’ll understand if you wish me to leave, to keep yourself safe.” I swallowed, hoping he would not dismiss me. He set the lantern on a wall hook. “I don’t wish that. But there’s one thing I would like.” “What is it?” “Your name. Unless you prefer to be called ‘The Red Rider’ now.” I smiled. “It’s Helena.” He nodded, satisfied. “Helena Basque.” I squinted at him. “If you already knew who I was, why did you –?” “I like to hear from the source directly,” he said. “Now. A boy’s been looking for you.” I blinked. What would Pierre be doing, looking for me at La Maison? Unless I had been too careless, and he had connected my activities to Touraine. “A boy with brown eyes and a mess of blond hair?” 298 He wrinkled his brow. “I didn’t see the color of his eyes, the way he squints. Surly looking fellow. He’s upstairs now, asking for you again.” I blinked. “Who are you talking about?” “Said his name’s Jacque. Jacque Denue.” A flush of anger and fear surged within me. I wanted to confront Denue and start beating on him before he got the chance to hit me again, but I saw no point. “What did he want?” “Wants to meet with you. In private. Said he knows something about the, eh, the ‘Licannors’, something like that.” I stiffened. “The Lycanthru.” “Yes, that’s it. The Lycanthru. Something about the Lycanthru and Duke Laurent.” A dozen possibilities raced through my mind. Had Denue truly discovered something of their secret activities, and of mine? Was he one of the Lycanthru himself, though all their other members were men? Was this another ploy, a petty attempt to ridicule and attack me again? Why seek me out now just to abuse me? “You said he’s upstairs?” Touraine gave a curt nod. “In the bar.” Denue might have some information I could use against Laurent, if he had discovered the Duke’s connection to the Lycanthru. Could he have also discovered something that might help me stop them? “Go about your business,” I told Touraine. “Say nothing to him.” “You don’t wish to meet him, then?” 299 “Perhaps. But I don’t want him to connect me to you. Can you keep him in the bar until nightfall?” “Most likely.” “Good. Can I keep my horse in your stable by the cellar?” “Of course. It’s for guests of La Maison.” I nodded, hoping no one would recognize Crimson. But I had nowhere closer to hide him. “Thank you. If you’re willing, can you find an opportunity to stand there? My horse is just within the forest. I’ll get to the stable and whistle for him when you’re ready, so you can lead him across before anyone sees him.” He considered this, looking up and stroking his chin. Perhaps deciding how to draw the least attention to himself and Crimson when they moved. “Or I can try to lead him there myself,” I said. “You don’t need to risk anyone seeing you with my horse.” He shook his head, smiling. “You’re risking enough, for all the rest of us,” he said. “My pleasure to help … ‘Red Rider’. Be back in ten minutes.” He left. I stood behind the shelves of wine that would so offend Father Vestille, and marveled at Gerard Touraine’s bravery on my behalf. I now saw that Francois placed him in high regard for more than his knowledge of the town gossip. 300 33. From the rooftop of Focult le Tonnelier – Focult’s Cooper Shop across the street – I watched Jacque Denue stroll out of La Maison. The moonlight cast a dark, swaying shadow of his clumsy movements as he continued past the building where I perched. I had stolen out of the cellar as night fell, while villagers poured into the front doors of La Maison. Those who wished to drink were focused only on the tavern entrance, while those who did not were focused on retiring to their own cottages. 301 Giving me ample room to climb to the roof of La Maison with Pierre’s grappling hook, then leap across to Focult le Tonnelier after most of the drinkers went inside. As I had waited and listened, first on one roof and then the other, I heard a few people mention Jacque Denue searching for the Red Rider. Thank God he had not connected me to Touraine. Apparently he had confided his search with several others in the tavern. I now descended from the roof of Focult le Tonnelier into the dark alley to find out why. “You’ve been asking for me,” I said beside him. Jacque Denue nearly fell over his own feet as he twisted about to see me peering at him through my large hood. “You,” he gasped. “Y-Yeah. You’ve been fighting them, haven’t you? Killing them?” I frowned, recalling Father Vestille’s displeasure with my crusade. “Yes.” “You know what they are, right? That they’re not – not wolves. They’re not even human.” He knew. He knew everything I had learned and perhaps more. “Yes. I know. But what do you know? About Duke Laurent?” He looked about, nervous. Almost terrified. “I can’t be seen with you. They’ll kill me.” “They’ll kill you, anyway, so talk.” He shook his head, looking hysterical. “They got people all over, you know? They could be watching us now.” 302 I couldn’t argue with that. The Lycanthru could be hiding anywhere in the shadows, in wolf or human form. He looked around again, over his shoulder and down the street. “Look, I’ll walk a block. Watch where I go and meet me there later. Don’t let anybody see you.” He backed away, half-stumbling as he marveled at my cloaked appearance. I let him depart, then crept to the corner of the wall to see where he headed. He hurried across the street, still glancing in all directions. At the end of the block, he stopped in front of a large horse stable and examined it. Looking around to confirm no one was watching, he threw up the latch on the door and stepped inside. I waited a few moments in the quiet, listening for any other movement. I studied the torch over the tavern door behind me. No one else would leave La Maison this early. I hurried from one alleyway to the next, moving down the street. Then I broke into a quick run for the stable doors and went inside. The stable felt even larger within, with room for over twenty horses. A single lantern at the opposite end of the stable gave sparse light, where Denue stood waiting. He seemed calmer now, standing taller as I strode toward him, my cloak wafting behind me. Nevertheless, his face paled as I approached. “Now,” I said. “Tell me what you know of Laurent.” “All right, I’ll tell you.” His voice turned menacing. “He’s eager to meet you.” 303 Hay shuffled behind me and strong arms coiled around my waist. I gasped as they squeezed harder, pinning my arms into my abdomen. I struggled to break free but my assailant was too strong. He hoisted me off my feet and I noticed a sign burned into the wall overhead: Les écuries de Brocard. These were Monsieur Brocard’s horse stables. The Lycanthru used Denue to set me up. He smirked as two of his cronies strode up from either side of me. I recognized Slob and Freckles as they grinned in triumph. The one holding me had to be Muscles. Denue leaned into my face to gloat. “What you gonna do now, ‘Red Rider’?” His friends laughed. I kicked hard against Denue’s chest with both heels, knocking him off his feet as he wheezed. My kick pushed me back against Muscles and we fell to the ground hard, though his bulk softened my blow. I elbowed his gut and he released me to roll away and rise to my feet. The fifth boy from Denue’s gang stood behind us with a toothy grin. They seemed to have forgotten how I beat them last time. Or they assumed they had me outnumbered. I kicked Muscles’ jaw as he tried to stand. I needed my strongest attacker to stay down. He grunted and moaned like a wounded animal, rolling in the dirt as he clutched at his face. Tooth kept smiling and spread his feet in a fighting stance, as the two beside Denue did the same. Then they all drew hunting knives and held them out, preparing to lunge. 304 “That’s right, wench,” Denue said from behind me. “This time, we brought better weapons than a club.” “Clever,” I said. “Wish I’d thought of that.” I raised my crossbow to Tooth’s startled eyes. He dropped the knife and raised his hands, backing away as I circled behind him. I was out of patience. He joined Slob and Freckles, who still gripped their knives, unsure. I cocked my head at them. Both knives fell to the floor. I nodded toward the ground beside a horse stall. “Over there.” They raised their hands in surrender as they backed toward it. Muscles crawled after them, still rubbing his jaw. Freckles scowled at me. “We’ll get you. You just wait,” he said. I fired a bolt between them. Freckles squealed as it struck the wood of the stall behind him. “Sit down and keep quiet,” I said. They dropped to the floor, hands still raised. I slung the crossbow over my shoulder and approached Denue. He drew a knife from his rear pocket and lunged, the blade flashing in his fist. I kicked up at his wrist and pinned it against a wooden pillar. He whined in pain as the knife fell. I kept his hand there and backhanded him across the jaw. I punched him a second and third time to send him spinning to the dirt. The other boys leaned forward, ready to stand. After I glared at them, they sat back on their 305 hands. I grabbed Denue by his tunic and tugged him to my face. He squirmed, his eyes bulging. “Lemme go, you witch! You wear pants and fight like a man. What kinda girl are you?” “One with little patience.” I shook him for emphasis. “Who told you to attack me? Was it Laurent?” “Yeah,” he grumbled. “Figured it’d be easy to nab a stupid girl.” “Capture? Not kill?” He shook his head. “I ain’t no killer! Just needed money. He’s paying us plenty to bring you unharmed.” “He wants me unharmed so he can harm me himself. You know what he is. You told me yourself.” “That’s what he told me to say, to make you come with us. I don’t know nothing else. Those are just stories to scare little kids!” “They’re not stories and you know it. Even if Laurent was an ordinary man, why would he pay you to capture me? What do you think he’ll do with me? And how long do you think he’ll let you live, after you do what he asks? Another night? Another few weeks?” Jacque shook his head. “He don’t care about me, so long as I help him.” “Once you’ve outlived your usefulness, he’ll make a meal of you. Like he does with the rest of La Rue Sauvage.” “Yeah, so what am I s’posed to do about it?” 306 “You know what sort of girl I am. What sort of boy are you? Sooner or later, he’ll kill you, now that you know his secrets. You can help me stand up to him, or start numbering your days.” “You’re crazy! I ain’t fighting the Duke of the whole province!” “You don’t have to. Just do what he told you to do. Take me to him. Tell him you captured me, but leave me opportunity for escape. When he least suspects it, I can –.” Something shifted in his eyes as he glanced toward the horse stalls. I whirled toward his friends, still seated, in time to see a horseshoe flying at me. It struck my forehead. The stable spun as I fell to the ground. I blinked at the dull pain as everything started to blur. Denue loomed over me, grinning. “Change of plans,” he said. I tried to clutch at him but I could barely sit up. His fist connected with my jaw and everything went black. I woke to shouts. “Imbecile! I told you to bring her last night!” It was Laurent’s voice. I shuddered, feeling cold and confused. I lay on my side, my jaw aching, my head throbbing. My throat tasted like dry manure, and there was a suffocating smell of dust from the surrounding hay. But not from Brocard’s stable where Denue struck me. 307 Somewhere less clean. Somewhere I had been before. I blinked awake with terror. I was back in Brocard’s barn in the forest, where I had intruded on the Lycanthru’s ceremony. Only now I lay on the ground floor, a few feet away from the vat of sulfurous liquid that filled the room with its foul odor. Standing over me on the raised platform, just fifteen feet away from the vat, Laurent glowered at Denue in a rage. “We grabbed some food and fell asleep,” Denue said. “She took a lot out of us. But I got her and she’s here now. What difference does it make?” Laurent backhanded him with a fist that sent Denue sprawling from the platform onto the dirt. “That is the difference, you impudent fool. From now on, do as you’re told.” My shoulder ached where I had been lying on it. My head pounded like a drum. I squinted at the few lit torches smoldering in the room, as rays of the approaching dawn peeked between cracks in the wood walls. How long had I slept? Ten or more of the Lycanthru stood around Laurent. A few wore their black robes and wolf hoods. Others wore their daytime clothes. Laurent’s advisor, Simonet, stood close by, his hands folded behind his back. Beneath their feet, I saw my repeating crossbow. If I could leap for it before they noticed me … 308 My body pulsed as I prepared to rise, but I couldn’t move my hands. I tugged again. Then I fingered the thick hemp binding my wrists behind my back. “Your Grace,” Simonet said in a monotone. I glanced back to find him studying me. “Well, look who’s awake,” Lieutenant-General Sharrad snorted. Laurent’s entire posture relaxed at the sight of me. He strode forward with a jaunt in his step and knelt down. Then he gripped my cheeks hard and lifted my face to his. “Good morning, Mademoiselle. A pleasure to see you again.” I grunted and tried to pull away. The other Lycanthru grinned like hyenas. “But a little too early, I think.” He released my head to fall painfully back to the ground. Then he raised his fist and brought it crashing down onto my jaw. 309 34. I woke again more slowly, roused by the sulfur stench. Sore muscles ached in my shoulders, thighs, and the back of my neck. I struggled to open my eyes as my chin rested heavily against my chest. Wake up, I ordered myself, inhaling the sulfur deeper, listening to the bubbling vat. Wake up! The room was full of sunlight and noise. My temples throbbed and I tried to grasp my surroundings. With an effort, I lifted my head to meet the eyes of Leopold Laurent, flanked by 310 Simonet, Sharrad and about thirty other men. He grinned as he held my crossbow. I flinched and shuddered, which made them all laugh. I felt paralyzed, unable to move anything but my head and neck. I glanced to either side and discovered my arms were spread apart and bound. Thick ropes extended from my wrists to distant supporting pillars. My breath caught in my throat. I tried to move my legs, to stretch my sore thighs. But they also stood apart on the dirt floor, my ankles secured to the same wooden pillars. I stared down at myself, helpless before the entire cult. “Welcome, dear Helena,” Laurent said in mock greeting. “Or should I call you, ‘The Red Rider’?” They exploded with hoots of triumph. All but the stone-faced Simonet, standing at Laurent’s side. A few men wore their black robes, but most were ready to resume the day’s normal work. “I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you chose to visit us,” Laurent continued, like a gracious host. “A pity you can’t stay long. Although you’ll be with us much longer than we hoped. We meant to finish you last night. To – what is the word? Ah, yes. To ‘rid’ ourselves of you.” This drew another round of cruel chuckles as Laurent patted my crossbow. I tried to stay calm as I tugged at the ropes, testing them. They had no give whatsoever. “Unfortunately, your incompetent friend, Jacque Denue, failed to bring you at the proper 311 time, but waited until it was near dawn. We all lead busy lives during the day, which only leaves us the night for our private activities. The saddest part is that I have significant business to tend to this evening, so our plans for you will be delayed even further. But don’t fret, Mademoiselle. Come midnight, we’ll all gather to bid you a fond farewell.” I pulled at the ropes again as a reflex, knowing it was pointless. “You can’t see behind you, Helena, but there’s a long trough there. That’s where we’ll toss your bones when we’ve cleaned all the meat off them.” My breath came in rapid gasps, to each man’s delight. “I claim her belly,” said a gruesome red-haired man. “I want one of her thighs,” Sharrad said with a smile, narrowing his blue-gray eyes. Laurent stepped forward. “All I want is her face.” “Not much meat there, Lord Laurent,” Sharrad said. “No,” Laurent admitted as he stood before me. He squeezed my cheeks together so hard I struggled to breathe for a moment. “But I want to see her eyes, wide and screaming, as she realizes her little adventure is over. Just before I devour her.” I shook in his grip. They were going to eat me! 312 His face hardened into stone. “You should have accepted my offer to walk away, Helena. Instead, you persisted in your stubborn attacks, killing over twenty of us in the last two months. Making quite a name for yourself.” He clenched his teeth, almost snapping them together. “Now you can die like the rest. Except that you’ve earned yourself a much slower, more painful demise. I’m sure you’re quite impressed with yourself, for how well you’ve done. So consider it an honor, the agony we intend to put you through this evening.” I kept still and focused on taking tiny breaths through my nose and teeth. I turned to Simonet, the only one not joining in the others’ celebration. His dull, fixed expression made me tremble even more. “The only reason we’re not feasting on you now is we need moonlight to transform,” Laurent explained. “We don’t need it for long, but it’s easiest for us all to change at night. Once we assume our new shape, we can keep it as long as necessary. But someone in town might notice if fifty men didn’t perform their duties today. And to be frank – every one of us wants a piece of you.” He released my face and I gasped, hanging my head. “Sharrad,” Laurent called. Sharrad stepped forward with a strip of cloth. He yanked it apart with his fists, showing its thickness as he marched toward me. “Why are you doing this?” I asked Laurent quickly. “Why are you attacking everyone?” 313 Laurent held up a hand, stopping Sharrad in his tracks. “Why?” he repeated. He spread his hands like a showman before the other men. “Why not?” They roared with sadistic laughter, as though I said something hilarious. Laurent paced, as if considering the question for the first time. “Power, Mademoiselle. Unlimited, eternal power. The age-old lure of immortality. All we need to do is kill a wolf for its pelt …” He aimed my crossbow between my eyes, smiling as he played a hunter. “And keep it among our possessions. Then, after absorbing a few rays of moonlight, we can transform into the most fearsome creatures the world has ever known. Provided we also drink the Lycanum potion.” He waved a hand toward the foul, bubbling vat. “Together, these things make us stronger. We age less rapidly. We remain powerful, even in our normal form, so long as we continue to feast now and then. Especially when we feast on the innocent.” Quick as lightning, he backhanded my left cheek. It stung like a block of wood. The room spun for a moment while I regained my breath. “You see what I mean?” He yanked off my hood, his force nearly choking me with it. Then he seized a clump of hair at my scalp and wrenched my head back. I gasped at the sharp pain. “But you’re strong, too, aren’t you, Helena? Stronger than anyone imagined. So we have to take extra measures to deal with you. And to make an example of you.” 314 He shook me by my hair. I clenched my teeth and let him hold me like a marionette. Resisting would only make it worse. “The intriguing thing about power, Mademoiselle, is that once a man tastes it, he can’t stop hungering for more. Tonight, when the moon is high, we shall assume our more powerful form.” He leaned close to my cheek, enough for me to smell his last drink of red wine. “Then we’ll feed on you, piece by piece, growing stronger – as you die, screaming.” No, I thought. Lord, don’t let me die like this. Help me escape! Send them away and help me escape! He grinned, my hair trapped in his fist. “I should conclude my business and join the others here by eleven o’clock. Then we’ll spend the night tending to you, for the last time, before we feast on the main course. That gives you a full day to consider your folly and form your apology to me, for your brash interference.” “What about the silver?” I gasped. “Why does it hurt you?” He gave my hair another sharp jerk. “You’re so persistent, Helena. You still hope to learn something to pass on to your friends, if you have any left. If you do, don’t worry. We’ll find them and finish them off. Just like you.” I thought of Pierre and tugged violently at the ropes, in spite of myself. Despite the pain that shot through my scalp as he tugged my head back in place. I considered Father Vestille and Gerard Touraine. A few anxious words from any one of 315 them, wondering whatever happened to me, could be enough to rouse Laurent’s suspicions and seal their deaths. Because of me. His voice softened to a purr. “Of course, if your apology is humble enough, I might let you beg for your friends’ lives. As for the silver …” He rested the point of my crossbow’s loaded bolt against my cheek and stroked me with it like I was his pet. “When your friend, Francois, killed Gustave with his silver ax, we were surprised that anything could harm us. But we consulted the Prime, who is far more experienced in these matters.” “The Prime?” “Don’t concern yourself with that, Helena. In La Rue Sauvage, I am the Prime.” The bolt jabbed at me as he growled, but it didn’t draw blood. He smiled, regaining his composure. “In any event, he explained that different Lycanthru had come into contact with silver over the years and died without explanation. We simply learned to avoid it. We don’t need to know the reason, any more than we need to know why we need the Lycanum or the pelt or the moonlight. We follow the rituals that were written down in prior centuries and reap the benefits. So long as there are unsuspecting villagers with children in our midst, I should live to be well over a hundred, with no one daring to challenge me.” He whispered harshly at my ear. “While you won’t even make it to age seventeen.” 316 He yanked my hair again. I yelped at the sudden pain, which ended abruptly as he released me. I lifted my head lazily, feeling dizzy as the barn and Laurent blurred before me. I blinked and saw that he held a blonde clump of my hair. He regarded it with mild surprise, then smiled at me. “I’ll just keep this as a souvenir.” He slid the hair into his waistcoat pocket as if it was a precious heirloom. I stared in horror and disgust. They were demented, every one of them, and Laurent was the most twisted of all. “Any more questions, Helena? Or are you finished?” I quivered in the ropes. “What do you think, Simonet? Is she through?” Simonet observed me without expression. He descended from the platform and stepped toward me, examining my face like I was an intriguing insect. “She’s frightened, Your Grace,” he said. “She knows it’s over.” I stiffened to keep from losing control. Anything I did or said now would only confirm the truth. I had no plan. No way out. Laurent’s eyes and face relaxed even more. “That’s what I wanted to hear. Now, Sharrad.” He stepped back as Sharrad marched at me with the cloth strip. He ducked under my bound arm and stood up close behind me, his broad chest against my back. “Wait! Someone will find me. You can’t –!” 317 The cloth came down past my eyes and was tugged between my lips. I struggled, my nerves flaring, as Sharrad secured the gag, turning the rest of my sentence into muffled gibberish. He knotted it tight against the back of my neck, catching strands of hair. Laurent stepped forward, studying me with a satisfied smile. I could barely move. Now I could barely utter a sound. He raised the crossbow to my face. “By the way, I believe this is yours.” He tossed it to the dirt beneath me. I stared down at it, loaded and ready to pierce their hearts. I tugged my wrists hard, which only tensed my sore muscles and kept my captors entertained. Laurent gingerly drew the hood back up over my head. “No one is likely to travel this way, but we can’t risk some fool hearing you struggle. Not before we’ve had our fun with you.” He stroked my cheek as if he were still the family friend I once trusted. “Think about how to apologize, Helena, to save a few of your friends. You’ll have all day to consider it. Jacquard will be here to watch over you.” He smiled over his shoulder at a tall unshaven man who nodded from his seat on the steps. “The rest of us would be missed, but Jacquard’s position is …” He pretended confusion. “What is it you do again, Jacquard?” Jacquard twisted his lip with annoyance. “Cooper’s apprentice,” he said. “Oh, yes, that’s it,” Laurent said, as if he had just remembered. “And a poor one at that. His 318 master might be relieved to do without him today. But he can keep an eye on you here, to make sure you don’t – wiggle too much.” He grinned like the devil. “Until tonight, then.” He walked out. Each of the Lycanthru filed out after him, smiling at me as they passed. A few of them waved. One devilish man made a chomping motion at me. I hung there between the pillars, a chill of horror surging through my nerves as they strode by, each one hungry for my blood. Each one eager to taste it when night fell. Behind them, Jacquard squatted and poked at the logs beneath the base of the vat, reducing the flame. I imagined them boiling me for their dinner as I stared into each ravenous glare. A shorter man marched at me, grinning with malice. “The party won’t start ‘til nightfall, Mademoiselle,” he said through tobacco-stained teeth. “Why don’t you get some sleep?” The men behind him laughed as his fist struck me and my world went black. 319 35. I awoke with a start. I lifted my head and blinked, breathing the sulfuric air rapidly through my nose. The gag had grown stale against my tongue. The man named Jacquard rose to a sitting position on the platform, where he had been sleeping. My sudden movement apparently woke him. He snorted, stretched, then regarded me with a scowl. “Up and ready for the day?” he said without humor. 320 It remained bright outside, but the shadows had shifted to the opposite angle. It was a little past noon. I had gotten a full but fitful sleep that I now felt in my sore limbs. I looked back at each of my wrists, still bound to the thick pillars. I shook my numb arms as best I could and rotated my wrists to get the blood flowing back into them. My lower back and the calves of my legs ached from standing suspended for so long. Below me, the crossbow still lay useless on the ground. Jacquard yawned and stood to fully stretch. I heard his back crack as he twisted his torso. Then he faced me with his hands on his hips. “Go on. Struggle some more for me.” I breathed slow and even. “No?” he asked. “Too tired? Get some rest, then. You’ll need all your strength tonight for screaming.” He sat back down and leaned lazily against the long counter beside the bubbling vat. He glanced at it, wondering whether to adjust the fire again. Then he folded his arms and studied me. “You thought you were something, huh? You really thought you could beat us.” He continued to study me from head to toe, watching for any sign of resistance, satisfying himself that I could not escape. Then he rose slowly and walked behind the long counter. He bent behind it and I heard him open cabinet doors and slide heavy objects across shelves. He stood, producing a small flask and a large bottle of liquor. He poured himself a small sampling and sipped it, 321 then eyed me again, looking disappointed that I had not moved a muscle. He lifted his flask toward me. “Your good health, witch.” He emptied the flask and filled it again. I steadied my breathing. Everything had happened so fast, I barely had time to think. And I could do nothing with the entire cult watching me. Jacquard would be a different matter, I hoped. I kept still, spread between the pillars like an animal carcass to be carved and eaten over a fire. Or Samson, the Bible hero who lost his great strength and was captured by his enemies who jeered at him, thinking him helpless. Until he asked them to place him between the pillars that supported their stronghold, where he pushed the supports apart when God restored his strength, destroying them all. I lifted my chin and tried to relax. I allowed Jacquard to study me again before he poured himself another drink. I couldn’t reach the crossbow, but I had a few advantages left. Reminding myself of that helped me calm down. First, they had left only one man to watch me. More important, they imagined me helpless. Which I might be if not for Pierre. Sweet, ingenious Pierre, who suggested the crazy idea of helping me fight like a wolf, before my first night out at Favreau’s farm. “I can’t give you teeth,” he had said, “but I’ve got something that might work for claws.” 322 He was so proud of his brilliant invention, as he should be, always asking me how my blades were working. I fixed my gaze on Jacquard as he tilted back another drink. Then I flicked my wrists, causing the silver blades to slide out from the top pockets in my gloves. They locked in place and I spread my fingers to hide them. If I closed my fists, the broad knives could be seen, extending just beyond my knuckles. With my palms open, Jacquard would never notice me sawing slowly through the ropes behind them. I just had to keep my movements slow and careful. Fine, Pierre, I thought. They work just fine. Shadows of clouds shifted across the floor, from the skylight cut into the overhead ceiling. I scraped away at the ropes, one fiber at a time. It maddened me to cut so slowly. But anything faster would draw Jacquard’s notice. Even more maddening, the ropes’ thickness ensured that I would be scraping through them, one gentle stroke after another, for hours. Of course, once they frayed most of the way, they should pull apart all at once. Then the crossbow would be back in my hands. Jacquard jerked up suddenly, narrowing his eyes. I stood still, like a deer sensing a hunter’s presence. I locked eyes with Jacquard and held still. “Not trying to wriggle free, are you, Mademoiselle?” My heart stopped. I stood rigid, hoping he would not step closer. 323 Jacquard lifted the flask to his lips, still watching me, then drank. I felt a wave of relief as he swallowed and refilled his flask. I resumed my sawing motion, one slow cut at a time, barely moving my wrists. I wondered if I had even made progress, but I dared not glance at the ropes. I had to trust they were fraying, a little at a time, until Jacquard lost interest in me once more. I prayed silent thanks that Laurent had chosen such a lazy guard. A more responsible man might have checked the ropes again to make certain they were secure. But Jacquard had no reason to imagine anything otherwise, not knowing Pierre’s cleverness. Pierre. I had to free myself and warn him. Warn Father Vestille and Touraine. In my rush, my right hand blade wedged between fibers and jerked the rope. Jacquard glanced up, seeing the rope shake. I froze. He almost smiled. “Go on. Try to pull free.” I ignored him, but kept my whole body rigid. Waiting for him to ignore me as well. “No?” he teased. “You’re not even going to try?” He chuckled to himself and poured another drink. I had to slow down. I couldn’t save anyone if Jacquard discovered my actions. I relaxed my breathing and focused. The moment he drained another flask, I glanced to my right. The rope had started to fray. 324 I sawed at it again, seeing new fibers sprout up. Given enough time, I could free myself. I just had to remain calm and patient. An hour later – judging from the shadows beneath me – I had scraped halfway through each rope. A few more strokes and the remaining fibers would start to shred. So long as Jacquard kept his distance for the next hour, I could pounce on him before he knew what happened. The silent crossbow still waited on the ground for me. Just a little more time and steady work … Jacquard sat back on the platform, still sipping from the flask in his hand. Over the last several minutes, his study of me had grown more intense. I eventually stopped worrying whether he could see my blades working. Though he watched my every movement, he could not see the silver shafts behind my palms, or the ropes slowly severing behind them. Yet he focused on me more than ever, while his head bobbed a little from all his liquor. He spent several minutes observing my boots alone. And of course, my trousers, which barely covered my legs. He took another swig of wine, eyeing me strangely. “You know – I like the way you look there, writhing.” My throat went dry. I glanced back down at the crossbow. He rose slowly to his feet and staggered once. I hoped he might fall over unconscious, but 325 he wasn’t drunk enough. “About this power, Mademoiselle. It increases everything. Not just our strength. It also increases our appetites. I need to eat more, smoke more. Drink more.” He lifted the flask. Then his eyes narrowed and traveled the length of my body. “I need more of everything.” I stiffened. As he took another swig, I made broader strokes against each rope. He returned his attention to me and I stopped. He smiled, as if recalling a private joke. “You know, I crave things now that I never wanted before. Never even thought of wanting. Strange things, like seeing a woman – or a child – suffer.” My whole body pulsed and quivered. Jacquard seemed to delight in it, as he approached me in small, measured steps. “Good thing is, brave Mademoiselle, that now I can satisfy all my cravings. No matter how wild they get.” He set his flask at his feet and stood directly before me, smiling and reeking of alcohol. He reached up and gently drew back my hood. Uncovering my eyes and hair and my scarred face. He snorted. “Not too bad, for all that.” He nodded at my triple wounds. “Almost pretty. Anyhow, you’ll do.” I fought to stay calm. To keep from jerking away at his touch, as he stroked my hair below the gag. He undid the knot and pulled the cloth free. I gasped, sucking air into my stale mouth. He seized my face, cutting off my deep breaths. I panicked and tried to pull away but his grip was too strong, squeezing my cheeks tightly the way 326 Laurent had. But Jacquard’s fingers jabbed my skin and pressed against my teeth, determined to produce pain. I shook in the ropes. I cut at them again with a single swipe, while he stood an inch from my face. Then I cut again. And again. “I know, sweet thing,” Jacquard said, enjoying my discomfort. “I’m supposed to leave you unharmed for tonight. For the others. But I figure, when someone’s already this damaged, who’s gonna notice a few more cuts and bruises?” I seethed, clenching my teeth to speak. “I couldn’t agree more, Monsieur,” I said as I sawed through the last fibers. The ropes fell like logs to the ground as my wrists dropped. Jacquard blinked at me, trying to grasp what had happened. I tensed my numb arms and drove my bladed gloves into his sides. His eyes bulged. Then the pain pushed through his stupor and he screamed, a horrid animal cry. He knocked over the flask at his feet and it shattered as his knees buckled. He clutched at my waist to stay upright. I tore the blades free and shoved them into him again. He cried out as the blood clung to my knives. I shook, wanting it to end. Wanting him to be a wolf, so I wouldn’t feel like vomiting, as I stabbed him again. He sank slowly, as tears streamed down my cheeks and his fingers lost their hold. He crumpled to the ground and collapsed on his broken flask. I collapsed onto him, exhausted. 327 I had just killed a man. Not a wolf, but a man. And I could do nothing to take it back. What had I become? Something banged from the rear of the barn, behind the platform. I started suddenly and lifted my head to listen. Had they left another guard behind? Something struck low against the wall again like thunder, much harder than a human could have. Crimson. I pushed myself off of Jacquard and stretched toward my bound ankles. I couldn’t hope to return to a standing position with my feet so far apart, but I stretched enough to saw through the rope encircling the inside of my heel. Once I freed my other foot, I shook my legs to get the blood flowing back into them. Then I raced to the platform door and threw it open. Beyond it, I found a spacious stable with eight stalls, only two of them filled. One with a horse that must have belonged to Jacquard. The other with Crimson. He whinnied in a fitful rage as he saw me, tossing his head in the stall. He must have put up a tremendous fight after they found him, because they had bound him in a cat’s cradle of ropes, much like they bound me, securing his legs, flanks and neck, so he could only shake helplessly until they returned. He was the main course Laurent spoke of, that they would enjoy after finishing me. I threw open the stall door and saw he had finally wriggled one hoof free to kick at the wall. I 328 hugged his neck to calm him. It did little to still my own rage, which began to boil over. “It’s all right, boy,” I seethed. “It’s all right. We’re leaving this place.” Night fell like thick tar. The flame beneath the vat had nearly died out, but I could still smell the sulfur amidst the barn’s choking dust. At long last, I heard their horses approach and gallop around the barn to the rear stable. The door to the stalls creaked open and there was a murmur of confusion and rage. I smiled, imagining their faces as they discovered Crimson was no longer bound in their cruel trappings. Then came quick footsteps and the sound of the connecting door as it flew open. The men rushed into the center of the barn with their lanterns, scanning the darkness for me and Jacquard. They found Jacquard soon enough. His dead body now hung where the Lycanthru had positioned me, between the two pillars. It had taken an hour, with Crimson’s help, to string him up properly. It was monstrous, I knew. But far less cruel than the Lycanthru tying me there alive. They held their lanterns up to his face to confirm he was dead. They wondered among themselves what had happened, how I had escaped, where I had run off to, where my horse had gone. More of them poured in, as I hoped they would. At first there were only a dozen or more. Then I counted eighteen, soon twenty-five, finally thirty-329 three. They flooded in so quickly I nearly lost count, but I kept them in my sights. I had to know how many there were. They huddled together in outrage, blaming Jacquard’s carelessness, blaming one another, demanding answers. They prepared to search the barn, raising their lanterns and looking about. Only one of them sniffed at the alcohol in the air and fingered a piece of the hay that I had stuffed into Jacquard’s shirt. I smiled. They had each brought the very weapons I needed. I stood up suddenly from the overlooking hayloft and stared through the enormous square hole at the men searching below. Hay and dust fell from my shoulders and my spreading cloak as I raised the repeating crossbow. My first shot tore through the lantern of the man standing in front of Jacquard’s corpse. It yanked the lantern from his grip and knocked it into Jacquard’s back, which I had dressed with hay and doused in liquor. The body burst into flames, a human candle that lit the length of both thick ropes. The fire caught on the pillars, also sprinkled with alcohol. Everyone gaped at the erupting blaze as I shot through the lanterns of two other men. The first one struck the ground and started an insignificant flame on one side of the barn. But the second hit its mark on the opposite corner where I had spilled more liquor, creating a blaze that roared to life against the wall. It followed the trail of alcohol that lined the interior, the fire scrambling along the wall to connect at each corner. 330 The Lycanthru’s eyes bulged as the room heated up rapidly. Crimson whinnied and rose from the darkness beneath the hayloft. I whistled and he leaped into position. I dropped onto his saddle, ignoring the bruising in my groin and thighs, and drove him to kick open the front door. We rushed into the night air and I leaped off to secure the entrance. The men recovered from their shock and charged at me as I shut the door and threw the locking bar down. Crimson trotted back to retrieve me while I drove three bolts into the bar for good measure. A sudden shuffling of dirt within told me the Lycanthru had halted upon seeing the protruding silver bolts. I stepped into Crimson’s right stirrup with one foot and held on as he whisked me to the rear stable. I jumped off as two men emerged from the rear door, one carrying a lantern. I shot them both where they stood. I shut the stable door and threw the bar down, then shot my final two bolts into it. After grabbing the Lycanthru’s discarded lantern, I mounted Crimson to circle around the barn. Light and heat emitted from every wall. Nevertheless, I took the lantern and hurled it against the front door, as the Lycanthru pounded against the inside of it. “Rider!” they raged. “Rider!” The lantern burst into a spreading blaze that licked up the alcohol on either side of the door and raced along the outer wall. I had lined the walls with liquor from corner to corner, inside and out, and spread the hay out evenly within. Creating an 331 inescapable tomb of flames. I watched the rest of Brocard’s barn erupt in a rising inferno, climbing higher and higher into the black sky, like a sacrifice on an enormous altar. So now I was a murderer. I had killed thirty-three men in less than a minute. Thirty-three men who gave themselves over to black magic to prey on the people of La Rue Sauvage. On innocent children. But no more. Whether I was a warrior or a murderer, I could do nothing to change it. I didn’t ask them to attack my family. That was their doing. And this was the result. For them, and for me. So be it. I turned Crimson away from the mounting inferno and the Lycanthru’s raging screams as fire billowed up every high wall. My cloak flapped behind me as we rode hard into the forest. I spotted a few other Lycanthru with lanterns moving into the clearing, stunned by the sight of the blaze. One noticed me riding off but only gaped at me, too surprised to give chase. I had enough moonlight to find my way through the well-traveled woods. I was glad I had abandoned the lantern, giving them no way to track me. My heart and pulse raced, my nerves hot with rage and fear. They meant to kill us, to devour me and Crimson for their own sadistic pleasure. They only received a portion of what they deserved. But I would serve up more to them before daybreak. 332 I never meant to become this, whatever I actually was. A murderer. Perhaps a monster. Whatever I had become, and whatever would become of me now, I would see to it that I destroyed the rest of the Lycanthru. I would see to it that no more innocent people in La Rue Sauvage suffered at their hands. I never meant to become a sixteen-year old warrior, and despite what Father Vestille believed, I had not started this war. But I would end it. 333 NOTE FROM AUTHOR D.A.

      "content": "I stiffened, my blood racing through my veins. The same blue-gray eyes of the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie and left me scarred. The same eyes of the wolf that Pierre and I met in the dark tunnel. What in God’s name did it mean? “I’m Lieutenant-General Vigo Sharrad,” he said, his words coming to me in a fog. “It’s my job to protect the people of La Rue Sauvage. And their farmland.” “I think someone’s been spreading rumors, Monsieur Sharrad,” Touraine said casually. Sharrad jutted his broad chin at Touraine, as if threatening to stretch forth and bite him. “And who’s spreading those rumors, do you think?” Touraine shrugged. “I don’t know. But I can’t imagine anyone fighting off a pack of wolves on their own. Let alone this – person wearing a bright red cloak. Can you?” “I can imagine a number of things.” Sharrad glared back at me. “I expect you’ve got a wild imagination, too, don’t you, Monsieur?” “Monsieur,” Touraine broke in again, leaning on the counter with a smile. “This gentleman’s just here for a drink. Maybe some people don’t like how he looks. Maybe they’re jealous of his cloak. So they’re making up stories about him. He hasn’t really done anything, has he?” 245 Sharrad’s eyes burned into me. I kept my head lowered, but kept watching him from the shroud of my large hood. Watching his eyes. “Not yet,” Sharrad said. “But I’ve heard reports, and I’ll be watching you, Monsieur. If I hear of any more unprovoked attacks on wolves or other animals, you’ll see me again.” “But, Monsieur,” Touraine continued. “If someone’s killed some of the wolves that are attacking people, that would be good, wouldn’t it?” Sharrad faced him with his fists on his hips. “When I need a tavern keeper to help me keep order in the village, you’ll be the first man I call on. Until then, keep quiet and bring me and my friends another round.” “Of course. Sorry, Monsieur. Be there in a moment.” Sharrad cast another glare in my direction. “You keep that crossbow put away while you’re indoors, understand?” I gave a slow deliberate nod. Sharrad regarded me another moment before striding away to his table. I shivered as I watched him go. I couldn’t have seen what I thought I did. It was impossible. But I couldn’t deny it. Those shining eyes were unforgettable. I would have to watch Lieutenant-General Sharrad closely until I could reason it out. Touraine glanced in Sharrad’s direction. “Try not to get yourself arrested. Or killed. Seems you’re making the wrong people angry. Of course, now that you’ve killed a couple of giant wolves, you probably think you can handle anything.” 246 “Tell me about those men. The ones who enjoy hearing about wolf attacks.” He nodded back at Lieutenant-General Sharrad before turning to line up several mugs on a tray. “He’s one of them. So is Brocard. They come in here with their friends every time there’s an attack. Someone from their group is usually the first to report it.” He wrinkled his brow. “Matter of fact, I never knew you used a crossbow, ‘til Brocard offered you more bolts.” “I thought Favreau told everyone that.” Touraine shook his head as he filled each mug in turn. “No one’s seen Favreau. His brothers found his stray pigs and rounded up most of them. But Favreau wouldn’t come out or let his daughter out, even when they beat on his door. Kept telling everyone to go away.” I felt an inner chill. “So how did anyone know about the wolf attack last night? How could anyone know I was there?” Touraine leaned over the counter and spoke in a lower tone. “Be careful. Someone knows what you did, and they’re spreading the word.” “Someone who was there,” I said. “Someone like Sharrad and his friends.” He seemed to consider this as he resumed filling the mugs. “Likely.” “So am I some kind of pariah now?” “Maybe. No one’s sure what to make of it. Someone attacking wolves late at night on a farm and killing two of them. Some think you’re a hero. Most of them didn’t believe you existed.” He 247 surveyed the room of hushed murmurs. “Of course, they do now.” I turned to view Sharrad and his table. The murmur of the crowd hushed as I faced them. Some men watched my every move, perhaps fearing I might draw my crossbow again. Sharrad’s cold eyes continued to focus on me. Beside him, Brocard raised his mug toward me with a smile. None of the other seven men at their table were smiling. They stared at me or looked over their shoulder, scowling and whispering at one another’s ear. They were all dressed differently, representing different jobs, different ages, different tastes. Yet they shared the same vicious scowl. I wouldn’t trust myself alone in a room with any of them. “How often are those men in here?” “Every night on the weekends,” Touraine said. “Either that crowd or some of the others.” “There are more?” “Plenty more. A few dozen, I’d expect. All different walks of life. Some farmers, some carpenters, merchants, woodcutters, coopers, blacksmiths. Some of them are very well off, some are barely managing. Not sure what they’ve all got in common. Except maybe a cruel sense of humor.” He shook his head again. “I’d stay away from them, if I were you.” I studied the surly gang across the room as they eyed me with contempt. “Yes,” I said. “That would be wise.” 248 27. It was near midnight before Sharrad and his associates left the tavern. I spied on them from a dark alley, feeling the evening’s chill, as Crimson waited behind me in quiet obedience. They seemed in good spirits now, shoving playfully at one another and making threatening growls, like rough-spirited children. Like Jacque Denue and his companions. Hairs rose on my skin. I could see what Touraine meant about avoiding these men. I didn’t 249 want to go anywhere near them. But I had to know how they were connected with the wolves. They mounted their horses and trotted off toward the woods. Brocard, still utterly pleased with himself, led the way with a lantern held aloft. I allowed them time to gain some distance, then climbed onto Crimson’s saddle and rode after them, following their distant light. About ten minutes later, Brocard and the others entered a large clearing on the outskirts of a sprawling farm. I tugged gently on Crimson’s reins, keeping us shrouded and still in the forest. The men rode ahead in full view, toward the large barn at the center of the pasture. Whoever owned this land seemed well-off. A wheat field spread for several acres beyond the grove of trees that hid the barn and silo. Yet there was no house connected with the barn, so the owner could afford to hire out farmers while he sat at home raking in profits. Sharrad and the others dismounted and glanced about, looking over their shoulders. Crimson kept perfectly still for me in the shadows. Once they were satisfied, Brocard raised his torch higher and led the way to the barn. He tugged open the front door. More torches blazed within, where several other men had gathered. I couldn’t see any particular person, only a small crowd. As a few of the men led their horses around back, Brocard and the others went inside, casting 250 final glances over their shoulders before they shut the door. Something felt wrong, unsettling me like a snake burrowing under my skin. I prodded Crimson forward by cautious steps into the shadowy grove, surveying the grounds to make sure no other men approached. A noise rose within the barn, like a unified cheer, or a collective moan from a herd of beasts. Crimson slowed his pace, and I couldn’t blame him. I felt a crawling chill in the air. Like something small and devilish laughing in the wind. We edged forward to the side of the barn. I dismounted and drew Crimson to stand close to the wall. The din inside grew louder and clearly human, almost musical in its unison. I crept to the front door and searched for a discreet way to enter. Up above, beams of light broke through the wall, revealing the loading entrance for stockpiling hay. I withdrew Pierre’s grappling hook and slid back the lever, letting its prongs spring out. I squinted, spotting a small triangular hole above the loading door where the wood had worn through. I swung the steel hook in circles, then let it fly. It caught the hole above the door and I tugged on it, feeling it embed itself in the wood. I paused, listening for any sudden movement, then started up the wall. Thankfully, I only had a few steps to climb to the loft. I righted myself and stepped carefully along the slim ledge as the strange rhythm grew louder within. I tugged the prongs free to return the hook to my belt and cracked the door open. 251 Hay and dust trickled down from the pile that had been shoved against it. I wrinkled my nose at the moldy straw that had been pushed to the outer edges by fresh hay. I spread the hay apart with cautious fingers, as if wading through weeds in a pond. The noise beyond the hay pile grew louder and stronger, the chant drumming through my entire body as I pushed deeper inside. Something reeked of sulfur, permeating the inside of the barn. Finally, I broke through part of the hay to peer through a giant square hole in the center of the loft. A large throng of men stood in formation on the floor below, dressed in black hooded robes and chanting in a strange language that sounded like Latin. Towering torches burned at either end of the ceremony. One robed man stood on a platform between two short pedestals, his arms raised to the assembly. Each hood depicted a grinning wolf, making them all look like black wolves with the robed bodies of men. Behind the leader, a large vat bubbled up something foul, the offensive sulfur odor I had detected. The hypnotic chant continued as two men each brought an animal carcass toward the leader. They laid both corpses on a pedestal, bowed to the leader, and backed away to resume their positions. They were two dead wolves. I shuddered. I had found the Lycanthru. Something shuffled nearby. I noticed four robed men standing on either side of me, looking down on the ceremony from separate corners of the loft. I steadied my breathing and didn’t move. 252 The leader produced a curved dagger and cut away a section of one wolf’s back. He held up the small rectangular pelt, showing it to the crowd as the chanting slowed. Then he wrapped it around the back of his neck, wearing it like a priest’s collar. As he did so, the other men produced similar wolf pelts and placed them around the backs of their own necks. Then the leader pointed straight up. Was he pointing at me? I held my breath. No one reacted to my presence. Instead, they craned their necks toward a skylight cut into the roof, which shed moonlight on each of them. The leader lifted his arms, welcoming the moon’s rays the way someone might welcome the sun’s warmth after a rainstorm. The others followed suit, raising their hands to the moon as if praising it. Then they produced small flasks from within their robes. The leader took his to the bubbling vat behind him. He lifted a large iron ladle from the vat, filled it with the foul goldenrod liquid, and poured it into his vial with a doctor’s precision. It bubbled a little more as he stirred the vat with his ladle, refreshing the sulfur stench in the air. He extended his arm to the other hooded figures. They stepped forward, one by one, to have him fill their own flasks. When everyone had taken from the vat, they returned to their positions to face the man on the platform. Then each one drew back his hood. I leaned forward and squinted at the leader. 253 And stared at the handsome features and piercing eyes of Duke Leopold Laurent. Duke Laurent, Papa’s influential friend. The man who bent down to smile at me after Jacque Denue’s friends attacked me, to ask if I was all right. The man who held a banquet to honor Francois, for his bravery in killing the wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie. A banquet from which Francois went home drunk, escorted by the Duke’s men, to be devoured by a pack of wolves that same night. As if by coincidence. Or by design. Duke Laurent, who made an appearance at every funeral of every person killed by the wolves. Who railed against the King for ignoring his letters, in which he begged the court to send soldiers to rescue us. Letters he never truly sent. Laurent. I clenched my jaw and tensed my shoulders to keep from shaking the surrounding straw. Laurent spread his arms to the crowd. “My brothers. I know you have concerns about the men we lost last night, and the red-cloaked rider who killed them. I assure you, we will find him, whoever he is, and make him suffer. As to how he did it, I have sent word to the Prime, and I will let you know his conclusions once I receive them. You have my word.” I bit my lip, seething. His word. “Meanwhile, I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty has accepted my invitation.” This brought a cheerful murmur of approval and a few joyful shouts. Laurent waved down their 254 excitement with his hands. “So do not be distracted by last night’s incident. It is of little consequence, and in another month, will amount to nothing. So let us celebrate these fresh kills from our two newest initiates, and the strength they will soon share with us. Not to mention sharing in our glorious destiny. Soon all of our patience will be rewarded. Let us drink to that.” A few men laughed. Duke Laurent held up his flask with two hands, as if it was a precious infant. The other men followed suit. Laurent tipped his head back and they all drank. He winced as if it tasted bitter, but then licked his lips to savor it, like a drunkard sucking down stale alcohol solely for its effect. He stepped forward to stand directly beneath the skylight. The moon shone on his face as he closed his eyes with a look of rapture. He shed the black robe from his shoulders, revealing that he was completely naked. I nearly gasped, but kept quiet in spite of my shock. Then Duke Laurent’s face began to change. His strange grin pulled back at the corners of his mouth and somehow kept pulling, widening his lips. At the same time, his ears seemed to stretch away from his jaws, and moved impossibly up toward the top of his head. His nose grew larger, lengthening like that of a dog and extending over his chest. Gray hair sprouted from his cheeks, forehead and chest as he hunched forward. He fell to his hands and knees and I saw a bushy tail grow and lift from behind his back. His arms and legs narrowed while his hands and feet thickened and 255 grew into animal paws. He crouched on the floor of the barn and opened his fiery eyes, grinning again to display canine fangs. Laurent had become one of the six-foot wolves I fought at Favreau’s farm. The Lycanthru weren’t simply worshiping wolves. They were the wolves! 256 28. Seeing Duke Laurent transform into a wolf from my secret overhead perch, I inhaled with a sudden squeak, unable to stop myself. The four robed men standing at different corners of the hayloft turned sharp eyes on me. The nearest one clawed through the hay and seized my wrist. Before I could think, he yanked me from my hiding place for all to see. Straw and dust fell from my cloak like a rainshower. “It’s him!” he shouted. “It’s the red rider!” 257 He tugged me toward himself again as Laurent – in his horrid wolf-form – gaped up at us with bulging eyes. Others also turned toward us, while the other men in the hayloft ran at me. I kicked at my captor’s shin and he groaned, clutching his knee. I grabbed a pitchfork set against the wall and turned it on another man as he rushed at me, thrusting its tines at him twice. He backed away and lost his balance, falling from the loft onto the crowd below. The other two paused before continuing toward me. I couldn’t fend them both off at once. I turned back toward the hay pile where I had hidden. I shoved at it with the pitchfork, forcing the heavy pile out the loading door. I pushed myself out into the cool night air, the thick clumps of hay beneath me. I landed hard on the cushion of hay and rolled onto the grass, my side aching from the impact. Thankfully, the previous night’s rain had softened the ground enough to ease my fall. I whistled for Crimson as angry shouts grew within the barn, and the cultists rushed toward the front door. Crimson galloped straight at me, as if the barn’s rising chaos helped him to sense my need. I stood and grabbed the horn of his saddle, letting his momentum propel me up onto him as the door flew open and the Lycanthru poured out. I glanced back as we charged for the trees. The men stood outside the barn, gulping down liquid from their flasks and removing their black robes. I barely glimpsed their naked bodies crouching low to the ground and changing like 258 Duke Laurent did. Becoming an army of enormous wolves that bounded after me with nerve-rattling snarls. We raced deep into the forest. I drove Crimson harder, pounding past dark pine trees. The welcome cover of branches and leaves gave little comfort, since the Lycanthru wolves would know the terrain as well as I did. Hearing sharp growls, I turned to see three wolves closing in. I leaned against Crimson, having no way to fire the repeating crossbow with one hand while riding. Instead, I drew my father’s crossbow, already cocked. Slow and steady, keeping a sure grip as we galloped on. I took aim at the tan wolf nearing Crimson’s heels and fired, praying I was right about the silver. The bolt struck his flank, behind his head. A clumsy shot. Yet he fell to the ground with wide-eyed surprise. The other two wolves scrambled past him. One glanced back at the dead wolf twice, seeming confused that the creature didn’t rise. So much for my doubts. I had just killed a man. A man who could transform himself into a wolf. My fist clenched the reins tighter. The other two wolves quickened their pace. I leaned forward in the saddle to draw another bolt from my satchel bag. I loaded it and carefully lowered the crossbow’s strap to my right stirrup, my body in rhythm with Crimson’s stride. After looping the strap under my boot, I yanked up on it 259 to cock the bow. I turned as a wolf opened its jaws to nip at Crimson’s hind leg. I fired straight into its skull and it slumped to the ground. The third wolf watched its companion collapse, and his rushing gait faltered for a moment. I re-loaded and cocked the crossbow as I glimpsed more wolves, perhaps eight of them, approaching from the distant fog behind me. I shot the third wolf in his neck and he spun to the mud. They would reach me in less than a minute. I could never hold them off with my few remaining bolts. I pushed Crimson harder, clinging to him as we surged forward, heading for who-knew-where. I had to find an escape, somewhere. Anywhere. Anywhere to hide from these beasts that were once men! Father Vestille was right about how dangerous the Lycanthru were, just as Pierre was right about my hood, now a bright red flag drawing the wolves straight toward me. A sudden inspiration struck me. I slid Papa’s crossbow back into place behind the saddle and grabbed the repeating crossbow, slinging its strap over my shoulder. Then I untied my cloak with one hand. The wind blew the hood wide as I pulled it against Crimson’s neck and secured it to the reins. I pushed the flapping cloak from my face and looped the crossbow strap over my neck, then gripped the reins in my left hand as I drew my grappling hook. I flicked its prongs open and let the hook dangle at my hip. 260 I spotted a thick tree limb, the kind I needed, and swung the hook toward its base. It looped under the branch and locked in place as I gave Crimson a final prod and a shout. Then I lifted my heels and held tight to the rope, tugging myself out of the stirrups. I curved up under the limb as Crimson fled beneath me. He paused and glanced back, but I shouted again for him to keep going. He obeyed, confused, but slowed to a trot, refusing to stray too far as I scrambled up the rope. We had gained enough distance that the wolves wouldn’t see me climbing in the dark fog. At least, I hoped they wouldn’t. I hoisted myself onto the limb, straining to wrap my leg around it. I straddled the branch in time to see the wolves approaching. They stared straight ahead, focused on Crimson and the flapping cloak. I slid the repeating crossbow strap off my shoulder and took aim. Pierre had melted down enough material to load it with ten bolts, all tipped with silver. I fired at the three closest wolves as they rushed toward my tree, plugging each one. They dropped to the ground and lay silent. The silver worked. I fired at two more oncoming wolves, who broke their stride to view their fallen companions. Once struck, they lay a few feet past them in a heap. The other wolves slowed their rush. Some stopped altogether and hunched, twisting their necks toward the surrounding trees. I fired at the two in front, dropping them where they stood. 261 The rear wolves backed up a few paces. Some turned and fled. An auburn wolf growled back at them. “Cowards!” he shouted in a guttural voice. My blood ran cold. It was true, what I heard as a child. The wolves could speak. Men who could turn into wolves, but still think and speak like men. And they had organized themselves into a small army to attack the people of La Rue Sauvage. To attack families and their children. Why? I dismissed my questions for the moment. I had three bolts left. More than a dozen wolves remained below. If I took out their leader – the auburn wolf shouting at the ones who fled – then the others might back down. He still faced them while the other wolves paused in the clearing, shifting from side to side and looking uncertainly at one another. I took aim at his head, just below the pointed ear. He charged back toward the other wolves as I fired. “Come bac–!” he growled as my bolt sank into the tree trunk behind him. The wolves froze. I trembled, trying not to give away my position. Two bolts left. “There!” the auburn wolf snarled. “He’s up there!” The others padded a few steps back. Perhaps to get a better angle. Perhaps out of genuine fear. I focused on the auburn wolf but he bounded away before I could fire again, toward the 262 wolves that escaped. I puzzled over that while the rest of the pack shifted back and forth in the muddy ground. I worked to slow my breathing. Where had the auburn wolf gone? Had he run off to gather reinforcements from the barn? I couldn’t last long against them all, and I couldn’t wait them out until daybreak. I had to use every small advantage I had. Such as the fact that wolves couldn’t climb trees. Something snarled and rushed from behind the other wolves, who parted to make way for it. The auburn wolf charged between them, sprinting madly at the tree trunk where my bolt had embedded itself. He leaped at the tree and bounded off it to jump higher at another tree near me. He struck that trunk and sprang from it, launching himself at me like a flying nightmare, his jaws wide. I noted that normal wolves can’t climb trees, while I fired as a reflex, sinking my last two bolts into the auburn wolf’s mouth and gut. The beast spun backward in mid-air and twirled to the ground. It hit the earth like a sack of potatoes and lay dead. No bolts left. The others stared at the fallen animal and glanced at one another, shifting their paws. But they didn’t leave. Some fixed their eyes on the auburn wolf. Others backed away, ready to run. A few growled up at me. I turned toward a shuffling sound farther up the path, as the wolves also turned. Between the leaves, over the bushes, I could see Crimson’s 263 head as he trotted back and forth. He had insisted on staying close. I whistled for him. Time to escape, if we could. The wolves glanced in all directions. Crimson bounded through the trees, the red cloak wafting behind him like a soldier’s flag. The wolves backed away. “There are two of them!” one snarled. “Run!” growled another. Half the pack turned and sprinted away as I watched, amazed. It wasn’t just Crimson that startled them. They withdrew at the sight of my hooded cloak. The remaining wolves lost their courage and ran as Crimson charged at them. Ran from the sight of my red hood. I swallowed, releasing a hard breath. I shimmied down the rope as Crimson drew near, then jumped onto his saddle and kicked at him, leaving the grappling hook behind. I could retrieve it tomorrow. Or Pierre could make me another one. We galloped toward Father Vestille’s hovel, kicking up mud and leaves, Crimson’s hooves pounding with the rhythm of my heart. I steadied my heartbeat, gathering my thoughts. Everything had suddenly become clear, in one horrifying night. One horrifying hour. The wolves spoke. I had not imagined it. The wolf that killed Grand’Mere Marie had spoken to unsettle me. He never expected me to survive and expose his strange ability. The Lycanthru were transforming themselves into wolves to attack people, led by Duke Laurent. 264 But I had discovered their weakness. The slightest touch of silver killed them. They now feared me. Feared my red hood. I thanked the Lord for revealing everything to me, my senses surging with relief and rage as we rushed through the frigid night. Everything became so clear. I could stop them. I could kill them all. 265 266 267 MY WAR 268 269 29. We emerged from the seclusion of the forest pines and trotted into the clearing where Father Vestille’s hovel sat. Nestled deep in the woods, his home was easy to reach and easy to maneuver from. Riding all the way into the village was out of the question, now that I knew the Lycanthru’s secrets. They would hunt me down. I could never use Pierre’s loft again. I tried to settle my racing heart. I had found the Lycanthru. And discovered Duke Laurent leading them. I still saw the image of his face 270 beneath that monstrous wolf-hood, standing before the cult that was terrorizing the province. Still saw Laurent and the other men drink that foul sulfurous liquid and transform themselves into enormous wolves. I shook off my fears. Silver would destroy them. I could destroy them. I had to keep my courage. More important, I had to keep myself hidden so I could rest. No one could know that I had anything to do with Father Vestille anymore. Or all of our lives would be forfeit. I led Crimson to the stable behind the stone hovel and surveyed the area for any witnesses. Then I kicked aside straw and lifted the secret door to Father Vestille’s underground sanctuary. I checked again for any sign of movement from the surrounding trees, then led Crimson down the ramp. He could fill up on oats and bed down for the night. I lit a candle and found the underground room much cleaner. No more cobwebs or dust clouds, and only a faint lingering odor of mold. Father Vestille must have spent a good part of his day making this place into a home. I swallowed. Could I ever again have a place to call home? Yet Father Vestille did his best to provide one, without even knowing whether I would return. I stepped back up the ramp to pull the top door shut, then got Crimson settled. Once he lay on the straw pile – much larger and fresher than last night – and closed his eyes, I climbed up the ladder and knocked on the trap door. I heard Father Vestille’s muffled voice and some quick shuffling overhead. 271 I was growing so accustomed to this night life, the life of a nocturnal beast, that I had forgotten normal people still retired to their beds well before midnight. “Helena?” Father Vestille called in a harsh whisper from above as he creaked across the floorboards. I pushed the door up and climbed into the warm candlelight of his front room. He stood there in his nightshirt, holding the candle on its tray. His anxious eyes were bloodshot. “I’m here,” I said. “Crimson’s settled for the night.” I stepped up into the room and eased the door shut. He deserved far more explanation of my activities, but I acted as though I had said all that was necessary. I couldn’t expect him to understand. He accepted it, clearing his throat. “Do you – Have you had anything to eat?” My pride urged me to lie and say I didn’t need anything. But my more practical stomach growled. “I’ll get you some bread,” Father Vestille said. “I still have some cheese and lamb from tonight’s supper. I hoped you might return.” He shuffled away to his table. I followed slowly as he unwrapped the remains of bread from a cloth in a round basket, then unwrapped some cold lamb and hunks of cheese from another platter. He looked at me, somewhat abashed. “I can light the fire again to heat this up.” 272 I shook my head. I didn’t want him to have to do anything more. Nor would it be wise to send up chimney smoke from his hovel after midnight, with the Lycanthru searching for me. I shuddered and clutched my shoulders. “It’s fine. Thank you.” I grabbed the meat and tore off a chunk with my teeth. I had not eaten for hours and the excitement in the forest only made me more ravenous. I was well into my second bite when I noticed Father Vestille staring at me with concern. I realized I had failed to give thanks again. I stopped chewing in mid-stride and bowed my head to thank the Lord for the food. For this place. For my life. Whatever might be left of it. I opened my eyes to find him still staring. Perhaps he was less worried about my prayers than for my half-starved condition. “Can I get you anything else? Do you need to bathe again? I can wait out here, or outside if you like.” I shook my head and chewed. I had to discuss tonight’s events with someone, and quickly. Even if it had to be Father Vestille. Before it was too late. “Father Vestille,” I began, then finished chewing. “… Something happened tonight.” He stood listening. Then he turned and pulled up a stool to sit before me. I sat in the chair by his table. It felt good to sit. To do something normal and safe. To imagine I could be safe again someday. I swallowed and lowered my eyes. “I saw them. The Lycanthru. I saw them all.” 273 His voice rose in a panic as he gripped my shoulders. “Helena. Are you all right?” I nodded. I didn’t shake him off. It felt good to be held, the closest thing to an embrace that I would experience for some time. My entire life had changed in a few days. In one terrifying night. I could never be the same person again. I could never again enjoy a feeling of safety or home or family. “There were several men, wearing robes. With images of wolves on them. They performed some sort of ritual. And – they changed into animals.” I met his eyes, which held horror but no disbelief. “Father Vestille. They’re the wolves that have been attacking everyone. They become wolves.” Father Vestille stared at me, then swallowed hard. “Are you all right?” he asked again. I gave a small nod. “Did they see you?” I felt cold inside. “Yes. They chased me. I shot a few of them.” “You shot them?” He seemed equally horrified. “Yes,” I said, offended. “It was wise at the time.” He sighed with some irritation. “Go on.” “Never mind,” I said, starting to rise. He remained in his stool and put a hand on my shoulder. His eyes were penitent. “Please.” I fumed for a moment, then sat back down. “I saw their leader. He removed his hood to drink 274 some potion that changed him into a wolf.” I swallowed. “It was Duke Leopold Laurent.” Father Vestille’s eyes widened. He continued to glare at me for several seconds. “The other day,” he muttered. I squinted at him. “What day?” He looked off, grinding his teeth. “The day your – your mother and Suzette – were killed. Duke Laurent invited me to his chateau for a talk.” My nerves flared with rage. “About what?” He set his jaw, narrowing his eyes. “To see how your family was faring. After the loss of your father.” I gasped and shook. Laurent had planned every attack. The banquet to make Francois drunk while Laurent’s own friends surrounded him at the tavern, waiting to strike at his home later that night. Then luring Father Vestille away from Mama and Suzette so the Lycanthru could murder them in broad daylight. Laurent. “Helena. I’m glad you choose to confide in me, but – why, exactly, are you telling me all this now?” I shivered. We both knew I had pushed him away for years, rejected his every offer of help or friendship. “Someone needs to know,” I said. “I can’t be the only one. Someone else needs to know, in case …” I broke off, uncertain how to finish. He finished for me, his eyes wide. “In case anything should happen to you.” He rose and turned away, frustrated. “I told you the Lycanthru 275 were dangerous. And if the Duke of La Rue Sauvage is involved –.” I stood and leaned toward him. “He’s not just involved. He’s leading them!” “Leading them against you!” he said. “Because you challenged them. Because you sought them out and found them.” “I can’t change what I’ve already done.” “But what will you do now? Will you go on fighting them? Killing them? These are not animals, Helena. They’re human beings.” “They’re not animals, and they’re not human beings. They left their humanity behind to become these things.” “You can tell yourself that if you wish. It’s still murder.” “This is a war!” “A war you started.” “No. A war they started. They’re killing innocent people. Innocent children! And you want me to let them!” “You know I don’t want that.” “I don’t know what you want. You want to help me. You want to shelter me and care for me. But you don’t want me to fight the things that killed my family.” He strode at me. “Because I don’t want them to kill you, too!” We held one another’s gaze for a moment. He was shaking. “I don’t want them to, either,” I said quietly. “But I can’t let them take any more children. Ever again.” 276 He struggled to calm himself, unable to respond. He knew what I felt, having hidden my family away during the war. But it seemed he had forgotten how to take risks to protect innocent people. “Helena. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. But I’m worried. Not just for your physical well-being, but also for your soul. If you wage this war, I fear for what you might become.” My stomach churned. He was like a man with a musket who refused to fire at the predators on his doorstep. “If you’re that concerned about what I’ll become, I can find another place to stay, so you won’t be burdened.” As I folded my arms and stepped away, I realized I felt something more than disgust at his cowardice. I feared he might be right. If I kept on fighting these monsters, could I become just as cold-hearted and bloodthirsty? Would I become the scar-faced monster that Jacque Denue and his cronies feared? “You are no burden,” Father Vestille insisted. “You can stay here for as long as you wish. I will gladly shelter you and feed you, and give you whatever you need to live a full and rewarding life. But I cannot help you kill.” I kept my back to him. I couldn’t expect a priest to help me kill anyone, beast or not. It seemed he was doing everything for me that his faith would allow. Which made me question my own faith. Was I truly seeking justice or merely revenge? Yet how could I let them ravage our people, our world, while I retreated into a safe, 277 warm house and pretended there were no monsters outside my door? When I could do something to stop it. I turned to face him. “Right now, what I need most is your confidence in me.” “I have every confidence in you, Helena,” he said. “But I cannot help you take up a sword. I might as well be putting it to your throat. It will only end in death.” I kept my body rigid. I couldn’t let him know the fear I felt, or let him put any of his own fear into me. I had no choice but to fight these beasts. Except to retreat, and wait to die. I lifted my chin. “Then let’s say we understand one another, and agree to disagree on what must be done.” He looked sad and distant, as if I were his own daughter leaving home, never to return. As though he was mourning the loss of my soul. I prayed he would be wrong. “I will accept that, for now,” he said. “I only want to help you, Helena. You’re all the – You are the only one left from your family. I don’t wish to lose you, too.” “I’ll do everything I can to see that you don’t. I promise.” He glanced aside, shuffled his foot, cleared his throat. “Come. Finish your supper and you can get some rest.” I followed him to the table without another word and did as he said, like a condemned man marching to the gallows. 278 Crimson woke before me. He stood in the darkness, where stripes of light shone through the cracks in Father Vestille’s floorboards above us. I ignored both Crimson and the light and shut my eyes, drifting back into a swallowing sleep. I woke perhaps an hour later, feeling refreshed and stronger. I sat up on the cot and had an odd feeling. A feeling of freedom and security. Of home. The underground cellar held little light or fresh air, but it was safer than any place where I could take refuge above ground. Where the wolves reigned. I stood to my feet and stretched. I wore one of Father Vestille’s old nightshirts, which hung down to my knees. But it kept me warm through the night, along with the blanket, and helped me feel human again for the few hours I slept. I looked about for my clothes. Then I remembered Father Vestille had offered to scrub them clean for me, despite my protests. I smiled now at the thought of him with a basin of soapy water and a washboard, working away at the filth on my pants. The pants he was embarrassed for me to wear in public, as anyone would be. The pants I wore to move freely enough to kill the wolves, which deeply disturbed him. Yet he cleaned them for me, despite his discomfort with my new life. It almost felt like having parents again. Someone to care for me. To accept and support me, even if he didn’t agree with my choices. I started toward the ladder to retrieve my clothes. Then I found them right in front of me, 279 folded in a basket at the foot of the ladder, along with my cloak and boots. The basket had a rope tied to its handles, which lay in a heap beside it. He had finished the work and lowered the container to the floor, mindful of my modesty by not entering the room. He was a good man. Better than I had thought, while he cared for Mama and Suzette over the past several months. Better than I treated him. Still, for all he had done to help us during the war and for all he did to shelter me now, he had still abandoned us when we needed him most. When I needed him most. After the wolf attacked, we needed courage and guidance, but he was away visiting other provinces, other churches. Seeking his own escape instead of facing them down, however he could. If he wanted to help me now, I would gladly accept it, but I couldn’t forget the past. I sighed and grunted. I had no time to mourn his choices. From the look of the sunrays filtering from upstairs and my well-rested state, it was already midday. Only a few hours left to report last night’s events to Pierre before darkness set in again. I reached for my clothes and carried them to the cot with my cloak and boots. Time to set to work. 280 30. L’atelier de Forgeron de Leóne smelled of rich oil and fire from the day’s work, nearly over now as dusk approached. Monsieur Leóne was away again, delivering special orders and securing more material. Pierre could not stop gaping at me for the entire time I told my tale. The events of last night – the Lycanthru, their ability to speak, the clear effect of the silver bolts, their new fear of my hood – every detail enthralled him. I told him everything, except for two significant details. 281 “Where did you go afterward?” he asked. I curled my lip. “I can’t tell you that.” He blinked, wounded. “Why not?” “Pierre, I trust you and I value your help. But I can’t reveal everything that I’m doing. Just trust that I’ve found shelter.” “But why can’t you stay here? You’re welcome to sleep in the loft anytime you want.” I touched his hand to show my gratitude. “I know. But I can’t let anyone find me here, or find you. Too many people know I’ve visited you before. That alone places you in danger. And I can’t let anything – I don’t want to endanger you any further.” His brows curved up with hurt, but he nodded his understanding. “Did you see any of them?” I blinked. “The wolves?” “The Lycanthru. Did you see any of their faces? Recognize anyone?” I stared blankly at him, imagining his obvious emotions on display as one of the Lycanthru – perhaps Duke Laurent himself – questioned him. I pictured the Lycanthru seeing through Pierre’s attempts to protect me as he claimed to know nothing. I saw them seize him by the throat and drag him deep into the woods where their mouths would transform into hungry jaws. “No,” I said. “I never saw their faces. I don’t know who any of them are.” Pierre frowned. “Too bad.” He locked his gaze on me. “Especially if they know who you are.” 282 “They don’t. Yet,” I assured him. “But they will.” “Red, don’t do anything dangerous.” I blinked at him. “I think it’s too late for that.” “Anything more dangerous than you’ve already done,” he clarified, sounding annoyed. “If you keep after them, they’re going to come after you. And they’ll find you.” “I don’t think so,” I said, thinking of the safety of Father Vestille’s hideaway. Wondering how long it might remain safe. “In any event, they’ll be searching for me already, don’t you think?” Pierre swallowed hard. “Of course. You saw them. Saw what they do. They won’t let that pass.” I nodded. “Which means I’ve got to stop them first.” “Red, you can’t! These people – these monsters, whatever they are – how can you stop them? You don’t even know who they are or where to look for them next.” “I know where to start.” “All right. Then I’m coming with you.” “No, you’re not.” “Come on, Red. How do you expect to stop me from following you? You know I’m a faster rider.” “I know.” I sighed and turned toward the other work table beside us, wishing I could take him along and lean on his help. But it would mean exposing him to the Lycanthru and marking him 283 for death, the way I had been marked. “Forgive me later?” I asked. He squinted, confused. “For what?” I struck his jaw hard and he spun in a half-circle on his way to the ground. Thankfully, his head missed the edge of the oak table. I dropped the heavy chunk of lead back on the work table, where I had just snatched it. I shook my stinging hand as I stared at Pierre’s quiet body lying on the floor, hoping the lead punch wouldn’t leave much of a bruise. I wanted to embrace him, stroke his head, thank him for his endless support and care. Instead, I had knocked him unconscious. I kept staring at him, wishing I was a different person. Someone he could love and be happy with. But I wasn’t. The Lord had assigned me a strange destiny, however short-lived it might be. To stop as many of these murdering creatures as I could. Before they finally killed me, too. I blew Pierre a silent kiss, hoping he truly would forgive me as I asked. For what I had done and for whatever I was becoming. I stepped over him and headed out the door. 284 31. The same hush fell over the crowd of swaying onlookers as I entered La Maison tavern, crossbow in hand. Before I pushed through the heavy doors, they were joking, shouting, jostling one another. Now they all fixed a silent gaze on me before quietly returning to their drinks and murmured discussions, stealing glances at me over their shoulders and cupped hands. No one risked speaking to me, perhaps fearing my wrath, or being otherwise drawn into my dangerous world. 285 Touraine eyed me from the bar as well, ending his conversations and shooing people away. He turned his back to me as I approached and took a seat on the stool. “Order a drink,” he muttered. I considered reminding him that his tavern refused to serve young girls, but this was no time to make sport. People were watching us. I laid my crossbow on the counter. “Monsieur,” I said, as if I was seizing his attention. He turned. “A glass of your best wine, if you please.” He soured. “Buttermilk it is,” he said, reaching below the counter. I frowned. He had not forgotten, after all. “Just put some water in a mug. And make it look dangerous.” He took a new mug and pitcher, turning his back to me again. “You had another busy night.” “Very busy. You heard of it, then?” “Heard there was a hunt. Heard some men found a pile of dead wolves out in the woods. Large ones. But no one knows who found them, and there’s nothing there anymore.” I narrowed my eyes. “Nothing there? Then how do they know there were any wolves there in the first place?” Touraine bowed his head, pretending he needed to polish a mug with his rag. “A rumor. Some claim they saw that red rider fighting wolves in the forest. They say he left a few there, dead. But they’re gone now. Others say that’s just a rumor spread by some drunkards. What do you say?” 286 He handed me the mug and I drank, wondering how to pretend it was alcoholic. I decided to drink it slowly, staring at the counter while he pretended to ignore me. I lowered my voice. “It’s no rumor. I assume someone started talking about last night’s events until they were ordered to keep silent.” I took another sip of water. “Have those men been back tonight? The ones who love hearing about wolf attacks?” “Same place as always. They’re calmer tonight, though, maybe because Duke Laurent joined them. He made a rare appearance.” My nerves flared. I turned to see them, gathered around their usual table. Lieutenant-General Sharrad sat near the head, with his gleaming blue-gray eyes. Duke Leopold Laurent was seated beside him, like a spider at the center of its web. The Duke’s royal advisor, Simonet, sat in the next chair, wearing his usual callous expression. They all studied me with violent disdain. I grabbed my crossbow and rose from the stool. “Mademoiselle?” Touraine asked, turning suddenly. “Mademoiselle, where are you going?” he demanded in a whisper. Once more secured, the crossbow hung at my hip as I strode toward the table. The table where the Lycanthru gathered to celebrate their victories after attacking people in the village. After chewing on the flesh of innocent mothers and fathers and five-year old girls. My boots clomped across the floorboards as I marched at them, my 287 cloak rippling behind me. They set down their drinks and sat taller, their backs rigid, their attention focused. Nearby observers shrank back, hunching over their drinks, eager to avoid us. I stood before the Lycanthru and stared straight at Laurent. No one moved. Duke Laurent squinted, confused. He blinked in surprise. “Helena?” A strange smile twisted across his lips. “Is that Helena Basque beneath that hood?” He recognized my scars across the lower half of my face. I no longer cared. I grabbed a nearby chair and slid it to the end of the table, opposite Laurent. I sat, with all eyes on me, as I lifted my hands to draw back the hood, revealing my face and blonde hair. Their eyes bulged in an odd mixture of horror and delight. They seemed outraged to discover their adversary was a mere girl. Yet they seemed all the more eager to take their revenge, now that they had seen my face. “So,” Laurent said, breaking the thick silence. “I haven’t seen you since – oh, yes. Since your little sister’s funeral.” Blood surged through my neck and temples. I wanted to lunge across the table and strangle him. But I could do nothing here, with so many witnesses. People who only knew Duke Laurent as I once did: a generous benefactor to our tiny community, a man we were all blessed to have leading us. He was a true wolf in sheep’s clothing. 288 Seeing he had rattled me, he continued to study my reactions with measured calm. I couldn’t let him unsettle me again. “Well,” he went on. “… What new things have you been up to lately?” I stiffened my posture. “A lot of hunting. Late at night.” Scorn lined every face around the table. I could almost feel, almost smell, their hatred of me. Even Simonet narrowed his eyes with bitterness. I was only a girl, but they wanted to destroy me at least as much as I wanted to destroy them. Laurent twisted his lip. “So I hear.” “So you witnessed,” I said. “From your platform.” The men around the table drew a sharp intake of breath. Sharrad bared his teeth, looking so savage I thought he might spring for my throat. Laurent fingered his mug, lifted it and drank. Then he continued to study me. “You seem to have learned a lot in one night.” “Not enough. I know what you are. What you become. But I don’t know which of you attacked me, or which of you banded together to kill Francois Revelier. Or the rest of my family.” Laurent squinted at me, cockeyed. “You’re accusing us of attacking you, Helena? And of killing your woodcutter friend? Forgive me, but I thought you were both attacked by a wolf. Isn’t that the story you’ve been telling everyone? Weren’t you attacked by a big, bad wolf?” The men snickered. 289 Laurent continued, like the ringmaster of a traveling circus troupe. “If you change your story now and say you were attacked by a man – well, I’m not sure how many people will believe you.” “There were witnesses.” “Oh?” Laurent asked in a mocking tone, as if this was new information. “Where are they now? Was that woodcutter one of them? Or your Grand’Mere? Or your Papa?” Hot blood filled my temples. Laurent folded his hands, satisfied. “Seems you’re the only one left to tell your tale, Helena. And reasonable people don’t often listen to hysterical little girls who lose their temper at funerals and refuse to associate with anyone. Especially when they take to dressing in men’s clothes and running through the woods late at night, hunting for witches and big bad wolves.” The others burst into laughter, except for Simonet. He continued to watch me with reserved eyes. I waited for the others to finish their mindless chuckles. “I’m not interested in exposing your dirty secret activities.” “No? Then how can I help you, Mademoiselle?” My cheek twitched, but I kept my body rigid. “I only want our province, once and for all, to be rid of you.” They stared at me in stunned silence. Then exploded into laughter. One man actually wiped tears from his eyes while attempting to regain his composure. 290 Laurent looked over the heads of his comrades and smiled. Other raucous conversations had resumed behind us, drowning out whatever was said at our table. Laurent smiled at the group and leaned forward. “Mademoiselle, let us be honest. You’ve done very well. You struck at us and actually did some damage. I’m not so proud that I cannot admit you beat us down. Twice. So you have my respect and admiration, and I congratulate you.” His grin hardened into stone. “And now it’s over. You cannot seriously hope to ‘rid’ your little province of me. Or the rest of our order, which happens to hold eighty-eight members. All with the same abilities that my friends and I share.” I tensed my back and shoulders, keeping my lips impassive. I couldn’t let him know he frightened me. “Eighty-eight? Still?” He grinned, seeming genuinely amused. “I apologize. You have reduced our ranks down to, what? Seventy-five? Yet as I see it – seventy-five to one? I think we can still rely on our numbers.” “Rely on them while you have them.” Laurent leaned forward again, incredulous. “So you’re serious, are you, Helena? You intend to take us all on?” I said nothing. He kept his eyes on me as he leaned toward Simonet. “Tell me what you see, Simonet.” I met Simonet’s cold eyes, which seemed to pierce my soul. “She’s passionate in her position, Your Grace. Unfortunately for her, she has no real plan. 291 She might continue to do damage, but she knows she won’t last long.” I tried to steel myself against all fear. To keep him from seeing it. Laurent turned to his right. “What do you think, Sharrad? Does she look serious?” Sharrad locked his gaze on me. His thin lips spread in a cruel smile. “I think she looks delicious.” His stare burned into me until I could actually feel his hunger. “You don’t frighten me,” I told him, stiffening my shoulders to convince myself. “You killed my Grand’Mere and you scared me in the tunnel when I was a child. But you won’t frighten me again.” Laurent squinted and exchanged looks of confusion with Simonet and Sharrad. “You think that Lieutenant-General Sharrad killed your Grand’Mere?” “I recognize his eyes.” Laurent seemed to understand, but acted as if I had said something amusing, while Sharrad’s nostrils flared. “Helena, dear. The wolf that killed your Grand’Mere is dead. Your friend, the woodcutter, killed him with an ax. That was not Vigo Sharrad, the head of our police force. Tell her who it was, Vigo.” Sharrad’s blue-gray eyes blazed. “That was my brother, Gustave.” I shuddered, while Laurent grinned with malice. It was Sharrad’s brother, with the same unsettling eyes. 292 “And tell her what you’ve wanted to do since that day, Vigo.” Sharrad twitched, as if wanting to pounce on me. “To devour the one who killed him. Which we did, a few years back. And to finish the job Gustave started.” “He means you, my dear,” Laurent said with delight. “Helena, consider what you’re getting yourself into. I’m willing to forget these recent incidents and we can part ways. I don’t expect us to remain friends, but if you walk away now, I promise you’ll live.” “No guarantee from me,” Sharrad said. Laurent put up a hand to quiet him. “I can keep our order in line, Helena. Including our honorable Lieutenant-General. Out of respect for your achievements – and your considerable losses – I can ensure your survival. However, if you continue this reckless endeavor …” He raised his hands in surrender. “There is little I can do to protect you. You can see how angry my friends are. I believe they want your blood.” “Blood, flesh and bone,” another man snarled beside me, his hair and eyes wild. “So as the last living member of your family,” Laurent continued. “If you place any value on your life at all, you’ll take this chance now to leave, unharmed. Otherwise, I cannot be certain what will happen to you.” He seemed to expect me to believe his lies, the way Papa did. I no longer bothered to hide the trembling throughout my body, even from Simonet. Despite my fear, I now shook with 293 something else: rage. “Nothing is ever certain in La Rue Sauvage, Monsieur Laurent. Except death.” I pushed the chair away and stood. My cloak whirled behind me as I strode toward the door. “Where are you going now, little girl?” Sharrad called across the room. I spun back at them, the blood filling my cheeks as they laughed. Sharrad meant to unnerve me, using the same words the black wolf had used. His own brother, the Lycanthru with shining eyes who killed my Grand’Mere and left me scarred. They wanted to remind me that, after all these years, I would not find anyone to believe my reports about them. About men who changed into talking wolves and threatened to gobble up little girls in the night. They meant to remind me that I was completely alone in my fight against them. But I already knew that. I raised the repeating crossbow to my shoulder and they abruptly froze, falling dead silent. Two of them shrank back. Other conversations stopped abruptly around the large room. “Hunting,” I said flatly. Everyone in the tavern watched me, with what might have been awe or revulsion. Either way, it was mixed with fear, which was what I needed. I had made the Lycanthru afraid. If the rest of the town feared me as well, so be it. I stepped outside and mounted Crimson, anxious to ride off and get my shaking under control. They had unnerved me, but I had also 294 unnerved them. I simply needed to focus on quieting my fears and unleashing my anger. They would remain in the tavern, deliberating over how to deal with me. I would have to be even more cautious about my contact with Touraine and Pierre, to keep them from linking us to one another. Which left me even more alone. I had no choice. I knew what I had to do. What I alone could do. I had destroyed a handful of them. There were seventy-five Lycanthru left. I would start keeping count. I rode hard into the open plain and galloped toward the forest. 295 32. Over the next two months, I fought the wolves, beat them down, struck fear into their hearts. In the waning hours of the night, I snatched one person after another from their jaws. Killed one wolf after another with a silver bolt. Until the whole village knew that someone was fighting for them, and had started to refer to me by the name the wolves had given me: The Red Rider. I couldn’t get at Duke Laurent, but I had reduced his numbers, and I could feel his rage at 296 every wolf I struck down. Knowing I would not give up. Knowing I was thinning his ranks. I continued to take refuge in the underground longhouse beneath Father Vestille’s hovel, while I received secret supplies from Pierre and secret information from Touraine. Though I had to maintain greater caution, now that people were watching me more closely, both wolves and villagers alike. And I had no way of knowing for certain which of the villagers might secretly be wolves. Tonight, Crimson waited for me in a thicket of trees near La Maison, keeping out of sight, while I stole through back alleys toward the rear of the tavern. After waiting for what felt like ages, I seized an opportunity to cross the street, using a passing carriage to hide from onlookers. Then I rushed to the cellar door, yanked it open and dropped inside, finding a basement corridor that led to the recessed storage area. I waited even longer in the wine cellar itself, though I felt far more secure within the quiet room, free of witnesses. Finally, Gerard Touraine descended the steps to the corridor and entered the wine cellar with his lantern. “Monsieur Touraine,” I whispered. He whirled about, wrinkling his brows as he held up the lantern. His face softened as he recognized my hood, hiding behind the wine shelves. “Mademoiselle? Is that you?” “Are you alone?” 297 He glanced over his shoulder on instinct, but there were no other footsteps. “Yes. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in over a week.” “I know. I’ve been finding information elsewhere. It’s safer that way.” He pursed his lips, understanding but looking disappointed. “So why are you here now?” “To see what you know. What you’ve heard. It’s not the safest, but it’s still the best. I haven’t heard much information lately, but I didn’t want to endanger you any more than I had to. I’ll understand if you wish me to leave, to keep yourself safe.” I swallowed, hoping he would not dismiss me. He set the lantern on a wall hook. “I don’t wish that. But there’s one thing I would like.” “What is it?” “Your name. Unless you prefer to be called ‘The Red Rider’ now.” I smiled. “It’s Helena.” He nodded, satisfied. “Helena Basque.” I squinted at him. “If you already knew who I was, why did you –?” “I like to hear from the source directly,” he said. “Now. A boy’s been looking for you.” I blinked. What would Pierre be doing, looking for me at La Maison? Unless I had been too careless, and he had connected my activities to Touraine. “A boy with brown eyes and a mess of blond hair?” 298 He wrinkled his brow. “I didn’t see the color of his eyes, the way he squints. Surly looking fellow. He’s upstairs now, asking for you again.” I blinked. “Who are you talking about?” “Said his name’s Jacque. Jacque Denue.” A flush of anger and fear surged within me. I wanted to confront Denue and start beating on him before he got the chance to hit me again, but I saw no point. “What did he want?” “Wants to meet with you. In private. Said he knows something about the, eh, the ‘Licannors’, something like that.” I stiffened. “The Lycanthru.” “Yes, that’s it. The Lycanthru. Something about the Lycanthru and Duke Laurent.” A dozen possibilities raced through my mind. Had Denue truly discovered something of their secret activities, and of mine? Was he one of the Lycanthru himself, though all their other members were men? Was this another ploy, a petty attempt to ridicule and attack me again? Why seek me out now just to abuse me? “You said he’s upstairs?” Touraine gave a curt nod. “In the bar.” Denue might have some information I could use against Laurent, if he had discovered the Duke’s connection to the Lycanthru. Could he have also discovered something that might help me stop them? “Go about your business,” I told Touraine. “Say nothing to him.” “You don’t wish to meet him, then?” 299 “Perhaps. But I don’t want him to connect me to you. Can you keep him in the bar until nightfall?” “Most likely.” “Good. Can I keep my horse in your stable by the cellar?” “Of course. It’s for guests of La Maison.” I nodded, hoping no one would recognize Crimson. But I had nowhere closer to hide him. “Thank you. If you’re willing, can you find an opportunity to stand there? My horse is just within the forest. I’ll get to the stable and whistle for him when you’re ready, so you can lead him across before anyone sees him.” He considered this, looking up and stroking his chin. Perhaps deciding how to draw the least attention to himself and Crimson when they moved. “Or I can try to lead him there myself,” I said. “You don’t need to risk anyone seeing you with my horse.” He shook his head, smiling. “You’re risking enough, for all the rest of us,” he said. “My pleasure to help … ‘Red Rider’. Be back in ten minutes.” He left. I stood behind the shelves of wine that would so offend Father Vestille, and marveled at Gerard Touraine’s bravery on my behalf. I now saw that Francois placed him in high regard for more than his knowledge of the town gossip. 300 33. From the rooftop of Focult le Tonnelier – Focult’s Cooper Shop across the street – I watched Jacque Denue stroll out of La Maison. The moonlight cast a dark, swaying shadow of his clumsy movements as he continued past the building where I perched. I had stolen out of the cellar as night fell, while villagers poured into the front doors of La Maison. Those who wished to drink were focused only on the tavern entrance, while those who did not were focused on retiring to their own cottages. 301 Giving me ample room to climb to the roof of La Maison with Pierre’s grappling hook, then leap across to Focult le Tonnelier after most of the drinkers went inside. As I had waited and listened, first on one roof and then the other, I heard a few people mention Jacque Denue searching for the Red Rider. Thank God he had not connected me to Touraine. Apparently he had confided his search with several others in the tavern. I now descended from the roof of Focult le Tonnelier into the dark alley to find out why. “You’ve been asking for me,” I said beside him. Jacque Denue nearly fell over his own feet as he twisted about to see me peering at him through my large hood. “You,” he gasped. “Y-Yeah. You’ve been fighting them, haven’t you? Killing them?” I frowned, recalling Father Vestille’s displeasure with my crusade. “Yes.” “You know what they are, right? That they’re not – not wolves. They’re not even human.” He knew. He knew everything I had learned and perhaps more. “Yes. I know. But what do you know? About Duke Laurent?” He looked about, nervous. Almost terrified. “I can’t be seen with you. They’ll kill me.” “They’ll kill you, anyway, so talk.” He shook his head, looking hysterical. “They got people all over, you know? They could be watching us now.” 302 I couldn’t argue with that. The Lycanthru could be hiding anywhere in the shadows, in wolf or human form. He looked around again, over his shoulder and down the street. “Look, I’ll walk a block. Watch where I go and meet me there later. Don’t let anybody see you.” He backed away, half-stumbling as he marveled at my cloaked appearance. I let him depart, then crept to the corner of the wall to see where he headed. He hurried across the street, still glancing in all directions. At the end of the block, he stopped in front of a large horse stable and examined it. Looking around to confirm no one was watching, he threw up the latch on the door and stepped inside. I waited a few moments in the quiet, listening for any other movement. I studied the torch over the tavern door behind me. No one else would leave La Maison this early. I hurried from one alleyway to the next, moving down the street. Then I broke into a quick run for the stable doors and went inside. The stable felt even larger within, with room for over twenty horses. A single lantern at the opposite end of the stable gave sparse light, where Denue stood waiting. He seemed calmer now, standing taller as I strode toward him, my cloak wafting behind me. Nevertheless, his face paled as I approached. “Now,” I said. “Tell me what you know of Laurent.” “All right, I’ll tell you.” His voice turned menacing. “He’s eager to meet you.” 303 Hay shuffled behind me and strong arms coiled around my waist. I gasped as they squeezed harder, pinning my arms into my abdomen. I struggled to break free but my assailant was too strong. He hoisted me off my feet and I noticed a sign burned into the wall overhead: Les écuries de Brocard. These were Monsieur Brocard’s horse stables. The Lycanthru used Denue to set me up. He smirked as two of his cronies strode up from either side of me. I recognized Slob and Freckles as they grinned in triumph. The one holding me had to be Muscles. Denue leaned into my face to gloat. “What you gonna do now, ‘Red Rider’?” His friends laughed. I kicked hard against Denue’s chest with both heels, knocking him off his feet as he wheezed. My kick pushed me back against Muscles and we fell to the ground hard, though his bulk softened my blow. I elbowed his gut and he released me to roll away and rise to my feet. The fifth boy from Denue’s gang stood behind us with a toothy grin. They seemed to have forgotten how I beat them last time. Or they assumed they had me outnumbered. I kicked Muscles’ jaw as he tried to stand. I needed my strongest attacker to stay down. He grunted and moaned like a wounded animal, rolling in the dirt as he clutched at his face. Tooth kept smiling and spread his feet in a fighting stance, as the two beside Denue did the same. Then they all drew hunting knives and held them out, preparing to lunge. 304 “That’s right, wench,” Denue said from behind me. “This time, we brought better weapons than a club.” “Clever,” I said. “Wish I’d thought of that.” I raised my crossbow to Tooth’s startled eyes. He dropped the knife and raised his hands, backing away as I circled behind him. I was out of patience. He joined Slob and Freckles, who still gripped their knives, unsure. I cocked my head at them. Both knives fell to the floor. I nodded toward the ground beside a horse stall. “Over there.” They raised their hands in surrender as they backed toward it. Muscles crawled after them, still rubbing his jaw. Freckles scowled at me. “We’ll get you. You just wait,” he said. I fired a bolt between them. Freckles squealed as it struck the wood of the stall behind him. “Sit down and keep quiet,” I said. They dropped to the floor, hands still raised. I slung the crossbow over my shoulder and approached Denue. He drew a knife from his rear pocket and lunged, the blade flashing in his fist. I kicked up at his wrist and pinned it against a wooden pillar. He whined in pain as the knife fell. I kept his hand there and backhanded him across the jaw. I punched him a second and third time to send him spinning to the dirt. The other boys leaned forward, ready to stand. After I glared at them, they sat back on their 305 hands. I grabbed Denue by his tunic and tugged him to my face. He squirmed, his eyes bulging. “Lemme go, you witch! You wear pants and fight like a man. What kinda girl are you?” “One with little patience.” I shook him for emphasis. “Who told you to attack me? Was it Laurent?” “Yeah,” he grumbled. “Figured it’d be easy to nab a stupid girl.” “Capture? Not kill?” He shook his head. “I ain’t no killer! Just needed money. He’s paying us plenty to bring you unharmed.” “He wants me unharmed so he can harm me himself. You know what he is. You told me yourself.” “That’s what he told me to say, to make you come with us. I don’t know nothing else. Those are just stories to scare little kids!” “They’re not stories and you know it. Even if Laurent was an ordinary man, why would he pay you to capture me? What do you think he’ll do with me? And how long do you think he’ll let you live, after you do what he asks? Another night? Another few weeks?” Jacque shook his head. “He don’t care about me, so long as I help him.” “Once you’ve outlived your usefulness, he’ll make a meal of you. Like he does with the rest of La Rue Sauvage.” “Yeah, so what am I s’posed to do about it?” 306 “You know what sort of girl I am. What sort of boy are you? Sooner or later, he’ll kill you, now that you know his secrets. You can help me stand up to him, or start numbering your days.” “You’re crazy! I ain’t fighting the Duke of the whole province!” “You don’t have to. Just do what he told you to do. Take me to him. Tell him you captured me, but leave me opportunity for escape. When he least suspects it, I can –.” Something shifted in his eyes as he glanced toward the horse stalls. I whirled toward his friends, still seated, in time to see a horseshoe flying at me. It struck my forehead. The stable spun as I fell to the ground. I blinked at the dull pain as everything started to blur. Denue loomed over me, grinning. “Change of plans,” he said. I tried to clutch at him but I could barely sit up. His fist connected with my jaw and everything went black. I woke to shouts. “Imbecile! I told you to bring her last night!” It was Laurent’s voice. I shuddered, feeling cold and confused. I lay on my side, my jaw aching, my head throbbing. My throat tasted like dry manure, and there was a suffocating smell of dust from the surrounding hay. But not from Brocard’s stable where Denue struck me. 307 Somewhere less clean. Somewhere I had been before. I blinked awake with terror. I was back in Brocard’s barn in the forest, where I had intruded on the Lycanthru’s ceremony. Only now I lay on the ground floor, a few feet away from the vat of sulfurous liquid that filled the room with its foul odor. Standing over me on the raised platform, just fifteen feet away from the vat, Laurent glowered at Denue in a rage. “We grabbed some food and fell asleep,” Denue said. “She took a lot out of us. But I got her and she’s here now. What difference does it make?” Laurent backhanded him with a fist that sent Denue sprawling from the platform onto the dirt. “That is the difference, you impudent fool. From now on, do as you’re told.” My shoulder ached where I had been lying on it. My head pounded like a drum. I squinted at the few lit torches smoldering in the room, as rays of the approaching dawn peeked between cracks in the wood walls. How long had I slept? Ten or more of the Lycanthru stood around Laurent. A few wore their black robes and wolf hoods. Others wore their daytime clothes. Laurent’s advisor, Simonet, stood close by, his hands folded behind his back. Beneath their feet, I saw my repeating crossbow. If I could leap for it before they noticed me … 308 My body pulsed as I prepared to rise, but I couldn’t move my hands. I tugged again. Then I fingered the thick hemp binding my wrists behind my back. “Your Grace,” Simonet said in a monotone. I glanced back to find him studying me. “Well, look who’s awake,” Lieutenant-General Sharrad snorted. Laurent’s entire posture relaxed at the sight of me. He strode forward with a jaunt in his step and knelt down. Then he gripped my cheeks hard and lifted my face to his. “Good morning, Mademoiselle. A pleasure to see you again.” I grunted and tried to pull away. The other Lycanthru grinned like hyenas. “But a little too early, I think.” He released my head to fall painfully back to the ground. Then he raised his fist and brought it crashing down onto my jaw. 309 34. I woke again more slowly, roused by the sulfur stench. Sore muscles ached in my shoulders, thighs, and the back of my neck. I struggled to open my eyes as my chin rested heavily against my chest. Wake up, I ordered myself, inhaling the sulfur deeper, listening to the bubbling vat. Wake up! The room was full of sunlight and noise. My temples throbbed and I tried to grasp my surroundings. With an effort, I lifted my head to meet the eyes of Leopold Laurent, flanked by 310 Simonet, Sharrad and about thirty other men. He grinned as he held my crossbow. I flinched and shuddered, which made them all laugh. I felt paralyzed, unable to move anything but my head and neck. I glanced to either side and discovered my arms were spread apart and bound. Thick ropes extended from my wrists to distant supporting pillars. My breath caught in my throat. I tried to move my legs, to stretch my sore thighs. But they also stood apart on the dirt floor, my ankles secured to the same wooden pillars. I stared down at myself, helpless before the entire cult. “Welcome, dear Helena,” Laurent said in mock greeting. “Or should I call you, ‘The Red Rider’?” They exploded with hoots of triumph. All but the stone-faced Simonet, standing at Laurent’s side. A few men wore their black robes, but most were ready to resume the day’s normal work. “I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you chose to visit us,” Laurent continued, like a gracious host. “A pity you can’t stay long. Although you’ll be with us much longer than we hoped. We meant to finish you last night. To – what is the word? Ah, yes. To ‘rid’ ourselves of you.” This drew another round of cruel chuckles as Laurent patted my crossbow. I tried to stay calm as I tugged at the ropes, testing them. They had no give whatsoever. “Unfortunately, your incompetent friend, Jacque Denue, failed to bring you at the proper 311 time, but waited until it was near dawn. We all lead busy lives during the day, which only leaves us the night for our private activities. The saddest part is that I have significant business to tend to this evening, so our plans for you will be delayed even further. But don’t fret, Mademoiselle. Come midnight, we’ll all gather to bid you a fond farewell.” I pulled at the ropes again as a reflex, knowing it was pointless. “You can’t see behind you, Helena, but there’s a long trough there. That’s where we’ll toss your bones when we’ve cleaned all the meat off them.” My breath came in rapid gasps, to each man’s delight. “I claim her belly,” said a gruesome red-haired man. “I want one of her thighs,” Sharrad said with a smile, narrowing his blue-gray eyes. Laurent stepped forward. “All I want is her face.” “Not much meat there, Lord Laurent,” Sharrad said. “No,” Laurent admitted as he stood before me. He squeezed my cheeks together so hard I struggled to breathe for a moment. “But I want to see her eyes, wide and screaming, as she realizes her little adventure is over. Just before I devour her.” I shook in his grip. They were going to eat me! 312 His face hardened into stone. “You should have accepted my offer to walk away, Helena. Instead, you persisted in your stubborn attacks, killing over twenty of us in the last two months. Making quite a name for yourself.” He clenched his teeth, almost snapping them together. “Now you can die like the rest. Except that you’ve earned yourself a much slower, more painful demise. I’m sure you’re quite impressed with yourself, for how well you’ve done. So consider it an honor, the agony we intend to put you through this evening.” I kept still and focused on taking tiny breaths through my nose and teeth. I turned to Simonet, the only one not joining in the others’ celebration. His dull, fixed expression made me tremble even more. “The only reason we’re not feasting on you now is we need moonlight to transform,” Laurent explained. “We don’t need it for long, but it’s easiest for us all to change at night. Once we assume our new shape, we can keep it as long as necessary. But someone in town might notice if fifty men didn’t perform their duties today. And to be frank – every one of us wants a piece of you.” He released my face and I gasped, hanging my head. “Sharrad,” Laurent called. Sharrad stepped forward with a strip of cloth. He yanked it apart with his fists, showing its thickness as he marched toward me. “Why are you doing this?” I asked Laurent quickly. “Why are you attacking everyone?” 313 Laurent held up a hand, stopping Sharrad in his tracks. “Why?” he repeated. He spread his hands like a showman before the other men. “Why not?” They roared with sadistic laughter, as though I said something hilarious. Laurent paced, as if considering the question for the first time. “Power, Mademoiselle. Unlimited, eternal power. The age-old lure of immortality. All we need to do is kill a wolf for its pelt …” He aimed my crossbow between my eyes, smiling as he played a hunter. “And keep it among our possessions. Then, after absorbing a few rays of moonlight, we can transform into the most fearsome creatures the world has ever known. Provided we also drink the Lycanum potion.” He waved a hand toward the foul, bubbling vat. “Together, these things make us stronger. We age less rapidly. We remain powerful, even in our normal form, so long as we continue to feast now and then. Especially when we feast on the innocent.” Quick as lightning, he backhanded my left cheek. It stung like a block of wood. The room spun for a moment while I regained my breath. “You see what I mean?” He yanked off my hood, his force nearly choking me with it. Then he seized a clump of hair at my scalp and wrenched my head back. I gasped at the sharp pain. “But you’re strong, too, aren’t you, Helena? Stronger than anyone imagined. So we have to take extra measures to deal with you. And to make an example of you.” 314 He shook me by my hair. I clenched my teeth and let him hold me like a marionette. Resisting would only make it worse. “The intriguing thing about power, Mademoiselle, is that once a man tastes it, he can’t stop hungering for more. Tonight, when the moon is high, we shall assume our more powerful form.” He leaned close to my cheek, enough for me to smell his last drink of red wine. “Then we’ll feed on you, piece by piece, growing stronger – as you die, screaming.” No, I thought. Lord, don’t let me die like this. Help me escape! Send them away and help me escape! He grinned, my hair trapped in his fist. “I should conclude my business and join the others here by eleven o’clock. Then we’ll spend the night tending to you, for the last time, before we feast on the main course. That gives you a full day to consider your folly and form your apology to me, for your brash interference.” “What about the silver?” I gasped. “Why does it hurt you?” He gave my hair another sharp jerk. “You’re so persistent, Helena. You still hope to learn something to pass on to your friends, if you have any left. If you do, don’t worry. We’ll find them and finish them off. Just like you.” I thought of Pierre and tugged violently at the ropes, in spite of myself. Despite the pain that shot through my scalp as he tugged my head back in place. I considered Father Vestille and Gerard Touraine. A few anxious words from any one of 315 them, wondering whatever happened to me, could be enough to rouse Laurent’s suspicions and seal their deaths. Because of me. His voice softened to a purr. “Of course, if your apology is humble enough, I might let you beg for your friends’ lives. As for the silver …” He rested the point of my crossbow’s loaded bolt against my cheek and stroked me with it like I was his pet. “When your friend, Francois, killed Gustave with his silver ax, we were surprised that anything could harm us. But we consulted the Prime, who is far more experienced in these matters.” “The Prime?” “Don’t concern yourself with that, Helena. In La Rue Sauvage, I am the Prime.” The bolt jabbed at me as he growled, but it didn’t draw blood. He smiled, regaining his composure. “In any event, he explained that different Lycanthru had come into contact with silver over the years and died without explanation. We simply learned to avoid it. We don’t need to know the reason, any more than we need to know why we need the Lycanum or the pelt or the moonlight. We follow the rituals that were written down in prior centuries and reap the benefits. So long as there are unsuspecting villagers with children in our midst, I should live to be well over a hundred, with no one daring to challenge me.” He whispered harshly at my ear. “While you won’t even make it to age seventeen.” 316 He yanked my hair again. I yelped at the sudden pain, which ended abruptly as he released me. I lifted my head lazily, feeling dizzy as the barn and Laurent blurred before me. I blinked and saw that he held a blonde clump of my hair. He regarded it with mild surprise, then smiled at me. “I’ll just keep this as a souvenir.” He slid the hair into his waistcoat pocket as if it was a precious heirloom. I stared in horror and disgust. They were demented, every one of them, and Laurent was the most twisted of all. “Any more questions, Helena? Or are you finished?” I quivered in the ropes. “What do you think, Simonet? Is she through?” Simonet observed me without expression. He descended from the platform and stepped toward me, examining my face like I was an intriguing insect. “She’s frightened, Your Grace,” he said. “She knows it’s over.” I stiffened to keep from losing control. Anything I did or said now would only confirm the truth. I had no plan. No way out. Laurent’s eyes and face relaxed even more. “That’s what I wanted to hear. Now, Sharrad.” He stepped back as Sharrad marched at me with the cloth strip. He ducked under my bound arm and stood up close behind me, his broad chest against my back. “Wait! Someone will find me. You can’t –!” 317 The cloth came down past my eyes and was tugged between my lips. I struggled, my nerves flaring, as Sharrad secured the gag, turning the rest of my sentence into muffled gibberish. He knotted it tight against the back of my neck, catching strands of hair. Laurent stepped forward, studying me with a satisfied smile. I could barely move. Now I could barely utter a sound. He raised the crossbow to my face. “By the way, I believe this is yours.” He tossed it to the dirt beneath me. I stared down at it, loaded and ready to pierce their hearts. I tugged my wrists hard, which only tensed my sore muscles and kept my captors entertained. Laurent gingerly drew the hood back up over my head. “No one is likely to travel this way, but we can’t risk some fool hearing you struggle. Not before we’ve had our fun with you.” He stroked my cheek as if he were still the family friend I once trusted. “Think about how to apologize, Helena, to save a few of your friends. You’ll have all day to consider it. Jacquard will be here to watch over you.” He smiled over his shoulder at a tall unshaven man who nodded from his seat on the steps. “The rest of us would be missed, but Jacquard’s position is …” He pretended confusion. “What is it you do again, Jacquard?” Jacquard twisted his lip with annoyance. “Cooper’s apprentice,” he said. “Oh, yes, that’s it,” Laurent said, as if he had just remembered. “And a poor one at that. His 318 master might be relieved to do without him today. But he can keep an eye on you here, to make sure you don’t – wiggle too much.” He grinned like the devil. “Until tonight, then.” He walked out. Each of the Lycanthru filed out after him, smiling at me as they passed. A few of them waved. One devilish man made a chomping motion at me. I hung there between the pillars, a chill of horror surging through my nerves as they strode by, each one hungry for my blood. Each one eager to taste it when night fell. Behind them, Jacquard squatted and poked at the logs beneath the base of the vat, reducing the flame. I imagined them boiling me for their dinner as I stared into each ravenous glare. A shorter man marched at me, grinning with malice. “The party won’t start ‘til nightfall, Mademoiselle,” he said through tobacco-stained teeth. “Why don’t you get some sleep?” The men behind him laughed as his fist struck me and my world went black. 319 35. I awoke with a start. I lifted my head and blinked, breathing the sulfuric air rapidly through my nose. The gag had grown stale against my tongue. The man named Jacquard rose to a sitting position on the platform, where he had been sleeping. My sudden movement apparently woke him. He snorted, stretched, then regarded me with a scowl. “Up and ready for the day?” he said without humor. 320 It remained bright outside, but the shadows had shifted to the opposite angle. It was a little past noon. I had gotten a full but fitful sleep that I now felt in my sore limbs. I looked back at each of my wrists, still bound to the thick pillars. I shook my numb arms as best I could and rotated my wrists to get the blood flowing back into them. My lower back and the calves of my legs ached from standing suspended for so long. Below me, the crossbow still lay useless on the ground. Jacquard yawned and stood to fully stretch. I heard his back crack as he twisted his torso. Then he faced me with his hands on his hips. “Go on. Struggle some more for me.” I breathed slow and even. “No?” he asked. “Too tired? Get some rest, then. You’ll need all your strength tonight for screaming.” He sat back down and leaned lazily against the long counter beside the bubbling vat. He glanced at it, wondering whether to adjust the fire again. Then he folded his arms and studied me. “You thought you were something, huh? You really thought you could beat us.” He continued to study me from head to toe, watching for any sign of resistance, satisfying himself that I could not escape. Then he rose slowly and walked behind the long counter. He bent behind it and I heard him open cabinet doors and slide heavy objects across shelves. He stood, producing a small flask and a large bottle of liquor. He poured himself a small sampling and sipped it, 321 then eyed me again, looking disappointed that I had not moved a muscle. He lifted his flask toward me. “Your good health, witch.” He emptied the flask and filled it again. I steadied my breathing. Everything had happened so fast, I barely had time to think. And I could do nothing with the entire cult watching me. Jacquard would be a different matter, I hoped. I kept still, spread between the pillars like an animal carcass to be carved and eaten over a fire. Or Samson, the Bible hero who lost his great strength and was captured by his enemies who jeered at him, thinking him helpless. Until he asked them to place him between the pillars that supported their stronghold, where he pushed the supports apart when God restored his strength, destroying them all. I lifted my chin and tried to relax. I allowed Jacquard to study me again before he poured himself another drink. I couldn’t reach the crossbow, but I had a few advantages left. Reminding myself of that helped me calm down. First, they had left only one man to watch me. More important, they imagined me helpless. Which I might be if not for Pierre. Sweet, ingenious Pierre, who suggested the crazy idea of helping me fight like a wolf, before my first night out at Favreau’s farm. “I can’t give you teeth,” he had said, “but I’ve got something that might work for claws.” 322 He was so proud of his brilliant invention, as he should be, always asking me how my blades were working. I fixed my gaze on Jacquard as he tilted back another drink. Then I flicked my wrists, causing the silver blades to slide out from the top pockets in my gloves. They locked in place and I spread my fingers to hide them. If I closed my fists, the broad knives could be seen, extending just beyond my knuckles. With my palms open, Jacquard would never notice me sawing slowly through the ropes behind them. I just had to keep my movements slow and careful. Fine, Pierre, I thought. They work just fine. Shadows of clouds shifted across the floor, from the skylight cut into the overhead ceiling. I scraped away at the ropes, one fiber at a time. It maddened me to cut so slowly. But anything faster would draw Jacquard’s notice. Even more maddening, the ropes’ thickness ensured that I would be scraping through them, one gentle stroke after another, for hours. Of course, once they frayed most of the way, they should pull apart all at once. Then the crossbow would be back in my hands. Jacquard jerked up suddenly, narrowing his eyes. I stood still, like a deer sensing a hunter’s presence. I locked eyes with Jacquard and held still. “Not trying to wriggle free, are you, Mademoiselle?” My heart stopped. I stood rigid, hoping he would not step closer. 323 Jacquard lifted the flask to his lips, still watching me, then drank. I felt a wave of relief as he swallowed and refilled his flask. I resumed my sawing motion, one slow cut at a time, barely moving my wrists. I wondered if I had even made progress, but I dared not glance at the ropes. I had to trust they were fraying, a little at a time, until Jacquard lost interest in me once more. I prayed silent thanks that Laurent had chosen such a lazy guard. A more responsible man might have checked the ropes again to make certain they were secure. But Jacquard had no reason to imagine anything otherwise, not knowing Pierre’s cleverness. Pierre. I had to free myself and warn him. Warn Father Vestille and Touraine. In my rush, my right hand blade wedged between fibers and jerked the rope. Jacquard glanced up, seeing the rope shake. I froze. He almost smiled. “Go on. Try to pull free.” I ignored him, but kept my whole body rigid. Waiting for him to ignore me as well. “No?” he teased. “You’re not even going to try?” He chuckled to himself and poured another drink. I had to slow down. I couldn’t save anyone if Jacquard discovered my actions. I relaxed my breathing and focused. The moment he drained another flask, I glanced to my right. The rope had started to fray. 324 I sawed at it again, seeing new fibers sprout up. Given enough time, I could free myself. I just had to remain calm and patient. An hour later – judging from the shadows beneath me – I had scraped halfway through each rope. A few more strokes and the remaining fibers would start to shred. So long as Jacquard kept his distance for the next hour, I could pounce on him before he knew what happened. The silent crossbow still waited on the ground for me. Just a little more time and steady work … Jacquard sat back on the platform, still sipping from the flask in his hand. Over the last several minutes, his study of me had grown more intense. I eventually stopped worrying whether he could see my blades working. Though he watched my every movement, he could not see the silver shafts behind my palms, or the ropes slowly severing behind them. Yet he focused on me more than ever, while his head bobbed a little from all his liquor. He spent several minutes observing my boots alone. And of course, my trousers, which barely covered my legs. He took another swig of wine, eyeing me strangely. “You know – I like the way you look there, writhing.” My throat went dry. I glanced back down at the crossbow. He rose slowly to his feet and staggered once. I hoped he might fall over unconscious, but 325 he wasn’t drunk enough. “About this power, Mademoiselle. It increases everything. Not just our strength. It also increases our appetites. I need to eat more, smoke more. Drink more.” He lifted the flask. Then his eyes narrowed and traveled the length of my body. “I need more of everything.” I stiffened. As he took another swig, I made broader strokes against each rope. He returned his attention to me and I stopped. He smiled, as if recalling a private joke. “You know, I crave things now that I never wanted before. Never even thought of wanting. Strange things, like seeing a woman – or a child – suffer.” My whole body pulsed and quivered. Jacquard seemed to delight in it, as he approached me in small, measured steps. “Good thing is, brave Mademoiselle, that now I can satisfy all my cravings. No matter how wild they get.” He set his flask at his feet and stood directly before me, smiling and reeking of alcohol. He reached up and gently drew back my hood. Uncovering my eyes and hair and my scarred face. He snorted. “Not too bad, for all that.” He nodded at my triple wounds. “Almost pretty. Anyhow, you’ll do.” I fought to stay calm. To keep from jerking away at his touch, as he stroked my hair below the gag. He undid the knot and pulled the cloth free. I gasped, sucking air into my stale mouth. He seized my face, cutting off my deep breaths. I panicked and tried to pull away but his grip was too strong, squeezing my cheeks tightly the way 326 Laurent had. But Jacquard’s fingers jabbed my skin and pressed against my teeth, determined to produce pain. I shook in the ropes. I cut at them again with a single swipe, while he stood an inch from my face. Then I cut again. And again. “I know, sweet thing,” Jacquard said, enjoying my discomfort. “I’m supposed to leave you unharmed for tonight. For the others. But I figure, when someone’s already this damaged, who’s gonna notice a few more cuts and bruises?” I seethed, clenching my teeth to speak. “I couldn’t agree more, Monsieur,” I said as I sawed through the last fibers. The ropes fell like logs to the ground as my wrists dropped. Jacquard blinked at me, trying to grasp what had happened. I tensed my numb arms and drove my bladed gloves into his sides. His eyes bulged. Then the pain pushed through his stupor and he screamed, a horrid animal cry. He knocked over the flask at his feet and it shattered as his knees buckled. He clutched at my waist to stay upright. I tore the blades free and shoved them into him again. He cried out as the blood clung to my knives. I shook, wanting it to end. Wanting him to be a wolf, so I wouldn’t feel like vomiting, as I stabbed him again. He sank slowly, as tears streamed down my cheeks and his fingers lost their hold. He crumpled to the ground and collapsed on his broken flask. I collapsed onto him, exhausted. 327 I had just killed a man. Not a wolf, but a man. And I could do nothing to take it back. What had I become? Something banged from the rear of the barn, behind the platform. I started suddenly and lifted my head to listen. Had they left another guard behind? Something struck low against the wall again like thunder, much harder than a human could have. Crimson. I pushed myself off of Jacquard and stretched toward my bound ankles. I couldn’t hope to return to a standing position with my feet so far apart, but I stretched enough to saw through the rope encircling the inside of my heel. Once I freed my other foot, I shook my legs to get the blood flowing back into them. Then I raced to the platform door and threw it open. Beyond it, I found a spacious stable with eight stalls, only two of them filled. One with a horse that must have belonged to Jacquard. The other with Crimson. He whinnied in a fitful rage as he saw me, tossing his head in the stall. He must have put up a tremendous fight after they found him, because they had bound him in a cat’s cradle of ropes, much like they bound me, securing his legs, flanks and neck, so he could only shake helplessly until they returned. He was the main course Laurent spoke of, that they would enjoy after finishing me. I threw open the stall door and saw he had finally wriggled one hoof free to kick at the wall. I 328 hugged his neck to calm him. It did little to still my own rage, which began to boil over. “It’s all right, boy,” I seethed. “It’s all right. We’re leaving this place.” Night fell like thick tar. The flame beneath the vat had nearly died out, but I could still smell the sulfur amidst the barn’s choking dust. At long last, I heard their horses approach and gallop around the barn to the rear stable. The door to the stalls creaked open and there was a murmur of confusion and rage. I smiled, imagining their faces as they discovered Crimson was no longer bound in their cruel trappings. Then came quick footsteps and the sound of the connecting door as it flew open. The men rushed into the center of the barn with their lanterns, scanning the darkness for me and Jacquard. They found Jacquard soon enough. His dead body now hung where the Lycanthru had positioned me, between the two pillars. It had taken an hour, with Crimson’s help, to string him up properly. It was monstrous, I knew. But far less cruel than the Lycanthru tying me there alive. They held their lanterns up to his face to confirm he was dead. They wondered among themselves what had happened, how I had escaped, where I had run off to, where my horse had gone. More of them poured in, as I hoped they would. At first there were only a dozen or more. Then I counted eighteen, soon twenty-five, finally thirty-329 three. They flooded in so quickly I nearly lost count, but I kept them in my sights. I had to know how many there were. They huddled together in outrage, blaming Jacquard’s carelessness, blaming one another, demanding answers. They prepared to search the barn, raising their lanterns and looking about. Only one of them sniffed at the alcohol in the air and fingered a piece of the hay that I had stuffed into Jacquard’s shirt. I smiled. They had each brought the very weapons I needed. I stood up suddenly from the overlooking hayloft and stared through the enormous square hole at the men searching below. Hay and dust fell from my shoulders and my spreading cloak as I raised the repeating crossbow. My first shot tore through the lantern of the man standing in front of Jacquard’s corpse. It yanked the lantern from his grip and knocked it into Jacquard’s back, which I had dressed with hay and doused in liquor. The body burst into flames, a human candle that lit the length of both thick ropes. The fire caught on the pillars, also sprinkled with alcohol. Everyone gaped at the erupting blaze as I shot through the lanterns of two other men. The first one struck the ground and started an insignificant flame on one side of the barn. But the second hit its mark on the opposite corner where I had spilled more liquor, creating a blaze that roared to life against the wall. It followed the trail of alcohol that lined the interior, the fire scrambling along the wall to connect at each corner. 330 The Lycanthru’s eyes bulged as the room heated up rapidly. Crimson whinnied and rose from the darkness beneath the hayloft. I whistled and he leaped into position. I dropped onto his saddle, ignoring the bruising in my groin and thighs, and drove him to kick open the front door. We rushed into the night air and I leaped off to secure the entrance. The men recovered from their shock and charged at me as I shut the door and threw the locking bar down. Crimson trotted back to retrieve me while I drove three bolts into the bar for good measure. A sudden shuffling of dirt within told me the Lycanthru had halted upon seeing the protruding silver bolts. I stepped into Crimson’s right stirrup with one foot and held on as he whisked me to the rear stable. I jumped off as two men emerged from the rear door, one carrying a lantern. I shot them both where they stood. I shut the stable door and threw the bar down, then shot my final two bolts into it. After grabbing the Lycanthru’s discarded lantern, I mounted Crimson to circle around the barn. Light and heat emitted from every wall. Nevertheless, I took the lantern and hurled it against the front door, as the Lycanthru pounded against the inside of it. “Rider!” they raged. “Rider!” The lantern burst into a spreading blaze that licked up the alcohol on either side of the door and raced along the outer wall. I had lined the walls with liquor from corner to corner, inside and out, and spread the hay out evenly within. Creating an 331 inescapable tomb of flames. I watched the rest of Brocard’s barn erupt in a rising inferno, climbing higher and higher into the black sky, like a sacrifice on an enormous altar. So now I was a murderer. I had killed thirty-three men in less than a minute. Thirty-three men who gave themselves over to black magic to prey on the people of La Rue Sauvage. On innocent children. But no more. Whether I was a warrior or a murderer, I could do nothing to change it. I didn’t ask them to attack my family. That was their doing. And this was the result. For them, and for me. So be it. I turned Crimson away from the mounting inferno and the Lycanthru’s raging screams as fire billowed up every high wall. My cloak flapped behind me as we rode hard into the forest. I spotted a few other Lycanthru with lanterns moving into the clearing, stunned by the sight of the blaze. One noticed me riding off but only gaped at me, too surprised to give chase. I had enough moonlight to find my way through the well-traveled woods. I was glad I had abandoned the lantern, giving them no way to track me. My heart and pulse raced, my nerves hot with rage and fear. They meant to kill us, to devour me and Crimson for their own sadistic pleasure. They only received a portion of what they deserved. But I would serve up more to them before daybreak. 332 I never meant to become this, whatever I actually was. A murderer. Perhaps a monster. Whatever I had become, and whatever would become of me now, I would see to it that I destroyed the rest of the Lycanthru. I would see to it that no more innocent people in La Rue Sauvage suffered at their hands. I never meant to become a sixteen-year old warrior, and despite what Father Vestille believed, I had not started this war. But I would end it. 333 NOTE FROM AUTHOR D.A.
