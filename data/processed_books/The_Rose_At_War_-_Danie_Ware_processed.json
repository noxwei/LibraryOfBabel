By the might of His inexhaustible armies a million worlds stand against the dark. Yet, He is a rotting carcass, the Carrion Lord of the Imperium held in life by marvels from the Dark Age of Technology and the thousand souls sacrificed each day so that His may continue to burn. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. It is to suffer an eternity of carnage and slaughter. It is to have cries of anguish and sorrow drowned by the thirsting laughter of dark gods. This is a dark and terrible era where you will find little comfort or hope. Forget the power of technology and science. Forget the promise of progress and advancement. Forget any notion of common humanity or compassion. There is no peace amongst the stars, for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.",

      "content": "The great ship groaned. She hung in the void like a thing dead: a steel shell, gutted and creaking. No life stirred upon her gantries or gunnery decks, no figures knelt within her silent chapel. Her levels were dark, her lumens exhausted. And yet, somewhere in her cavernous depths, there glimmered suitlights. Six shifting circles of pale visibility shone out like search beams, glittering from the frost-cold steel of the walls. A squad of armoured warriors followed a walkway, single file. Though they walked slowly, their steps echoed in metallic ripples from the endless, empty mazes of corridors and conduits. And with them, there came the faintest glimmer of song. Domine, libra nos… Holding her place in the centre of the line, both hands on her bolter, Augusta Santorus raised the Litany of Battle alongside her Sisters, their harmonics like tendrils, unfurling through the chill. Ahead of her, Sister Superior Veradis moved at the front of the exploring squad, her bolt pistol in one hand and her auspex, its screen shimmering a dull green, in the other. From the lightning and the tempest… The litany was familiar, steadying. It flowed like shared strength between the six figures, their blood-scarlet armour all ceramite and plasteel, their cloaks black and white. Each one bore the embroidered symbol of the Bloody Rose, the Order Militant of the Adepta Sororitas dispatched to scout this floating corpse. Their mission, to look for survivors – and to protect the interests of the Ecclesiarchy, to whom this ship belonged. But, search though they might, the cruiser Santa Xenia hung silent, her carcass already rotting. ‘Keep the line tight.’ Veradis’ orders sounded quietly in the squad’s vox-beads. Amid the flow of the litany, the Sister Superior was listening. Our Emperor, deliver us… Behind Veradis, Augusta continued to sing, her voice weaving in with that of her Sisters. In the chapels and cathedrals of the schola on Ophelia VII, it was easy to perceive Him, standing stern and patient at prayer, or overseeing their combat training as they battled beneath His gaze. But here– The thought was unworthy and she silenced it, concentrating on the hymn. From plague, temptation and war… The litany was absolute: He was everywhere. As the squad moved down another metal stairway, past another layer of hatches and vents, so they raised His name, and His presence walked with them. Our Emperor, deliver us… Even here, down in the depths of this great, steel sepulchre. ‘I fear the spirit of this vessel is fading,’ Veradis said, her tone still quiet. ‘Yet the retention of her atmosphere and grav-field suggests that she may still be occupied. We will proceed along the lowest gantries, down towards the fusion reactor. If any spark of life remains, I suspect that is where we shall find it.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad returned their obedience, and Augusta followed the line as it turned through a T-junction and began to move lower. From the scourge of the Kraken… But still, she kept the hymn in her heart. The ambush was loud, and clumsy. They had descended two more levels, right down to the creaking, filthy access paths of the Xenia’s lowest helots. Pict screens set into terminals fizzled with white noise. They cast ghostly illumination on rust-flowering walls, and upon their own half-loose wiring, hanging like exposed nerves. Augusta’s red boot came down beside a fallen servo-skull. It grinned eyelessly back at her, mocking. ‘’Ware!’ The cry came from ahead, from Sister Leona. Instinctively, Augusta dropped to a combat-crouch, her bolter covering the corridor. In the narrow beams of the suitlights, she had an erratic, confused view of incoming motion: of muscle and steel; of bared, yellow fangs; of the eager, jagged glint of corroding augmetics. A second later, there came the thunderously red muzzle flash of Leona’s heavy bolter, opening to its full suppression. The noise was tremendous. Over the vox, Veradis gave orders, her tone calm: ‘Leona, lay down covering fire, keep them back.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us… The bolter hammered its song of war. The shapes stumbled, cursed, bellowed, fell. Voices bawled, coarse and mocking. There was an answering return of fire, and the smashing of melee weapons against metal armour. Explosions chewed up the corridor and ricocheted, sparking, from the walls. Water and refuse scattered under repeated impacts. ‘Emlyn!’ Veradis snapped. ‘Do you have contact?’ ‘Aye!’ At the rear of the squad, Sister Emlyn’s response was drowned out by another burst of bolter-fire – the ambush was converging from both ends. Beside Augusta, Sister Lucienne spat a curse – in the turmoil and the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The litany spilling from her like determination, Augusta came back upright, trying for a clear line of sight. Somewhere in the darkness, deep, tuneless voices launched into a squalid ditty, then scattered again, laughing. Orks. Augusta’s heart thumped in her chest. Orks had found the floating ship – scavengers, perhaps. The seethe of muscle and weapon took on form and comprehension, became shapes she recognised. She’d never seen an ork in the flesh, but she’d studied their images on the schola’s data-slates many times… she’d just never realised how big they were, how slavering and coarse. Her voice sang, furious and elated. Our Emperor, deliver us! They were xenos, invaders on an Ecclesiarchy ship. And they would die. She took a single shot over Emlyn’s shoulder, heard the squall as her carbide fusion matrix round bit into thick, green flesh. She heard Veradis ordering Leona to keep firing, and for the squad to advance, step by step, behind her cover. She heard Emlyn, the litany rising savagely from the rearmost Sister. She saw the whoosh of Sister Pia’s flamer, bathing the corridor in its sudden conflagration. She heard howls of pain and rage; she heard explosions, and the guttural derision of the orks’ voices. She heard one of her Sisters hiss with a sudden stab of agony, but she couldn’t tell who. ‘The corridor’s blocked with corpses!’ The voice was Leona’s. ‘We can go no further!’ ‘Gantry to the left,’ Veradis snapped. ‘We’ll get behind them!’ Augusta obeyed the order and ran. Behind her, Lucienne did the same, her armour gleaming in the firelight’s dance. They skidded, their footing slippery with spreading gore. The whole space seemed full of struggles and curses, of the bulk of muscle and metal. A huge, hoary hand grabbed for Augusta’s shoulder. She turned and put a round into the leering greenskin, then she was up the steps and out of its reach. ‘Throne!’ As they reached the gantry, Lucienne cursed again. ‘Where did they even come from?’ The last of the firelight flickered from a mess of struggling orks. They were undisciplined and rough, fighting amongst themselves now, all striving to get to the front. The biggest had a huge, notched axe, and it was hacking the smaller ones to pieces as it waded forwards. Even as it reached the steps, Veradis’ bolt pistol took it clean in the face, and it went over, bawling and kicking. The smaller ones were on it in a moment, enacting their bloody revenge. ‘Keep moving!’ The Sister Superior’s tone was grim. ‘And keep your vigilance, Sisters – there will be more!’ From the begetting of daemons… Red boots bashed along the walkway. The litany continued, fervent, tight with focus and rage. The orks were pausing now, abandoning their burned and their fallen. They seemed to be retreating, but they gave harsh, guttural snarls. ‘There will be more of them,’ Veradis said. ‘Now, move!’ The squad began to run. Corridor and gantry turned though a bend and became a steel bridge, suspended over a sheer, bottomless drop. Cold yawned at them from below, a dead breath from some vast and empty space, but Augusta paid it little attention – she was watching for more orks. Which was probably why she missed the gretchin completely. It was too small, too fast. With a high-pitched gibber, it hurled itself from the darkness, grappling for a hold. Startled, Augusta sent her shot wide. The thing hit her shoulders and faceplate, knocking her backwards; she grabbed at it with her free hand, striving to prise it free as it chittered and clawed, ramming its nimble fingers into the edges of her visor. She cursed, pulled, threw– But it was too late. Without realising, she’d taken another step back. She felt her heel go, tried to catch herself, made a belated grab for Lucienne’s outstretched hand… …missed it. Lucienne cried aloud, ‘Sister!’ In a split second of utter disbelief, Augusta realised she was falling, down, down, into the dark. Our Emperor, deliver us! Lucienne was shouting for Veradis, but the noise was already lost, too far above her to be possible. Incomprehension clamoured loud – she had no idea how she could have done something so foolish – then a steel girder caught her, slam, across the base of her spine. She grunted, scrabbled for a handhold, but her momentum turned her head over heels and dropped her, once more, into the depths of some utter, pitch-black nothing. By the–! She hit the bottom belly first, hard enough to rattle her teeth. Stunned, she lay there, tasting blood from a bitten tongue. She was half-immersed in the thick soup of the ship’s bilge, but she was alive, thank His grace and mercy; she was still breathing. Her hips hurt where she’d struck the girder, but her suit diagnostic was still showing full integrity. From the curse of the mutant… The litany in her heart like a prayer of gratitude, she pushed herself to her hands and knees, and looked round. She had no idea where she was. What? A spike of nervousness shot through her chest. She could see nothing, just the ripples of the water in an impenetrable cavern of black. The gleam of her suitlight was tiny, swallowed whole by the space around her. There was no light above her, no sign of her Sisters, no hint of the walkway from which she’d fallen. As she sat back on her heels, reaching for her bolter, a savage spasm of pain shot through her back. There was nothing broken, but she’d lost her weapon. Sudden adrenaline flashed; her hands searched frantically under the water. One of the schola’s earliest combat lessons: you never lost your bolter. It was a part of you, part of your faith and ordination. It was always in your hand, or fastened to your suit. A flicker of disappointment, like she’d let Him – let her squad and her training – down… But that thought felt like panic. She shoved it aside and tried the vox. The vox-channel was a crackling wasteland, devoid of life or hope. Just as if it, too, had no idea where she was. Our Emperor, deliver us… Slowly, holding the fear at bay, Augusta came to her feet. She drew the hidden punch-dagger from the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and took a full ten-second awareness check, turning slowly around. Nothing. Her mouth was filling with horror; her skin was shivering with chill… Nothing. A morte perpetua… Standing there, tiny and lost, she clung to dagger and litany like twin threads of pure hope. She prayed for His guidance, His strength, His light to bless her in this unknown darkness. She prayed for His forgiveness for her ridiculous blunder. And she remembered – forgiveness was only offered to those who fought on. She must focus. The one thing she knew: the Sisters’ muster point, back up at the observer deck. She must find a wall, and then a ladder. Once she was back up in the ship’s corridors, she could orient by their layout and numbering. She picked a direction and began to wade. The emptiness was vast, and absolute. Her hands constantly reaching for her bolter and coming back empty, Augusta moved through the ship’s belly like some tiny, squeaking thing, her position marked clearly by her suitlight and by the flowing arrowhead of ripples that pointed at her, wherever she went. In the viscous, filthy water, things bumped at her calves, almost as if they sought to harry her along. She swallowed her nausea, and forged past them. That thou wouldst bring them only death… She told herself: she knew this, knew the drill that came with it. She knew to conserve her water and rations, knew to set the beacon on her suit so her squad could detect the signal. But, like the orks, this had only ever been theory. A cruiser was a diagram on a data-slate, a tidy cutaway that bristled with clarity and labels. She knew where the observer deck was – it was up at the watch gallery, below the keel sail. But this…? She could not falter, it was not permitted. So she waded on, hard shocks of pain in her back with every step. She shone her little light as far as she could, but still, she found nothing; it was as if she’d been swallowed alive. She had no idea, even, if she was going the right way, or if she was just walking in circles. There were no labels down here, no handy descriptions – not as much as a magnetic field for her digi-compass. That thou shouldst spare none… But… she had no choice. She forced her way forwards through the water, searching with increasing fear for an edge, a way up, for anything that would bring the darkness back to a graspable size. And, as she pushed on, and on, and still on, and there was still nothing, the desolation of it began to spiral outwards from around her, vast and cold; it made her head spin and her breath catch like spikes in her throat. This could not be a ship; it was a scraping, groaning, rasping, lightless void, echoing with horror. The creaking was some endless, mournful cry; it crawled with unseen threats. It stretched around her like a thing eternal, like– Her chrono chimed the hour, and the faint, familiar song of bells echoed outwards over the water. It brought her back to herself and she stopped, holding her breath to listen. But still, nothing moved. Only the cold. Only the darkness. And only the things that bumped against her shins… By the Light! Where am I? What have I–? With a wrench of effort, she ground herself back into motion. She tried to keep praying, but the words were hollowing, now, and slowly, slowly, they bled from her like the dark was full of leeches. Her hand tightened on her dagger until her gauntleted fingers hurt. Soon, she began to hear other noises – noises like voices, like echoes of remembered hymns, like splashes in the limitless murk. Once, she thought she heard gunfire, and she almost ran in the direction of the sound, but it faded before she’d gone very far. The things in the water bumped and bumped at her; she had to stop herself shuddering and kicking back at them, shoving them away. Sometimes, her suitlight picked up odd gleams under the surface, as if some eyeless, deep-dwelling creature were baring its hungry teeth… How could there be no end to this? Surely, even if she were in the very bottom of the ship’s hull, there would be…? And then, she saw something. It was a support, a mighty, riveted pillar of steel that stretched upwards, high into the dark. It was pitch-black, utterly smooth and completely devoid of ladders, or of identification. It was ice-cold, glittering with frost. And it bore words. What? Augusta blinked, wondered if the darkness was playing some trick, but no, she was not seeing things. The words were like shadows in the pale chill; they looked like they’d been made with a finger. They said, ‘Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos’. The Emperor has forsaken us. Pure, stark cold went down her back. Forsaken. She turned, put her back to the metal and raised the dagger, but she could see nothing. Beyond her tiny suitlight, the darkness concealed a thousand eyes, a thousand questions. A thousand unseen tentacles uncoiled like Ruin from the water. Forsaken. What had happened to the ship? They had seen no sign of her crew, no signs of combat, not even bodies. She tried to tell herself that this was surely some lost crew member, scared and alone, but what if it wasn’t? What if the words had been written by something else? Something forsaken? She stayed where she was, her heart racing. Slowly, the ripples of her passage flattened and she watched the water, alert for any shine or swell. Again, she tried the vox, but it crackled at her, the noise filling her head and chest with static. Adrenaline screamed at her, told her to move – move! – but she could not. There was something out there. Something that knew exactly where she was. A thought came at her as if it were not her own, a tiny sliver of doubt in her adamantine faith. What if… What if He really had abandoned her? Punished her for her foolishness? She had no Sisters to guard her back, no bolter to slay her foe. Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos. Another splash, now closer, the noise unmistakeable… There really was something down here! Her blood thumped hard in her ears. She strained to hear past it. She was sure that, this time, the sound had been real, not the yammering of her doubts, not these monsters internal that threatened to undermine and betray her. She held the blade like a talisman, praying for His light, for His forgiveness. For His wisdom in the dark. Her every nerve shivered with– There! And another splash. The faintest of ripples, like a windless whisper across the black water’s surface. They teased at the very limits of her suitlight’s range. That thou shouldst pardon none… The litany came back to her in a flood, the words almost frantic. Her mind filled with the white fuzz of tension, her tongue seemed cleaved to the roof of her mouth. Doubts hammered at her heart like weapons… she struggled to force them down. She had fallen, disgraced herself. She had lost her bolter, an unthinkable sin. Forsaken. There was uncertainty in her heart and mind and chest, where there should be only strength and courage… Splash! Again. The noises were somewhere to her right. The sounds were too light for the heavy-booted orks, too slow for the gretchin. Her dread crystallised, shattered. I am Adepta Sororitas, and I fear nothing, not xenos, not heretic, not creature of Ruin… She closed her hand on the tiny blade, and forced herself to move. Her hips still spasmed with pain, but she followed the sounds. As she moved, the darkness seemed to shift about her like unheard laughter; it blew through her, mocking her weakness, and she strove to shut it out. She focused her mind on searching for markings or discrepancies, for anything that would tell her where she was. She had not gone much further before she found a second, colossal support and a second finger-mark, this one jagged with anger and pain, and much shorter. It said only, ‘Salva nos’. Save us. From what? Again, she turned, putting her back to the metal. The darkness howled back to its full strength, invading her thoughts like a plague. What had taken place upon this empty ship? Slain her crew and left her to drift, alone and abandoned? Striving for calm, she reviewed her orders and the information that Veradis had given them, but there were no answers. Only… only that they’d found no bodies. At least, not in the ship itself. Because… because they were all down here? Her nausea rose again, bitter in the back of her throat. A image of eyeless, rotting, bumping things came flooding into her mind, all bared bone and trailing wires and rancid, bloating flesh– Again, that splash, closer this time; she could see the ripples as they spread, hear them as they lapped gently against the column’s cold steel. Whatever it was, it was near. That nearness honed her fears down to a single, hard target – there! She moved towards the sound, her blade ready. And then, at last, she saw the faintest glimmering of the light. It came from above, from some walkway, impossibly high above her head, but it did not shine upon the bilge-water. There was something in the way. Something big. At first, she couldn’t make it out – it seemed like some huge, lumpish blur – but as she grew closer, she realised what it was. It was a pile, pointing roughly upwards at that glimmer of illumination. It was– She stopped, her mouth full of revulsion, her suitlight illuminating something grotesque: corpses, bloated, blank-faced and rotting. Hundreds of them. Even as she looked, craning up and up towards the light above, something fell and tumbled slowly down the side of the pile. It hit the water. Splash. Augusta stood there, transfixed. She could see the rotting insignias of the Xenia’s crew, and her mind struggled to find a prayer – for them, for herself – but her words were lost. Splash. She stepped closer, dagger still in hand. Where her suitlight shone, she could see pieces of faces almost intact – a young officer, barely more than a boy; a man in the rank remains of Ecclesiarchy robes; a servitor, rusted and still. Forsaken. By the rot of their remaining flesh, they’d all been dead some time. Then a deep growl of laughter made her turn. It was an ork. Just the one, and at first, Augusta struggled to believe what she was seeing. It was far bigger than she was, armour and all, a hulking, muscled monstrosity with a wide and toothy grin. But this one bore no metal – no augmetics or ornamentation of any kind, not a single shiny or reflective surface. And it was not green. In her suitlight, it looked… it looked purple. Seeing her raise her little dagger, it gave an audible snort and grinned wider. Shreds of flesh and fabric were still caught between its fangs. Forsaken. The fate of the Xenia’s crew… some of them must have been still alive, thrown down here in despair and desolation, knowing they had no escape, and waiting for the orks to… Her nerves spiked with revulsion. With fury. And this, she understood. She lunged and struck, her feet hampered by the water. Her blade struck the hollow of the beast’s throat, but the ork wore thick, grox-leather armour. Its grin broadened further. Her doubts, her fears, shattered. We beseech Thee, destroy them! Red-hot rage went through her – cleansing like fire. She raised her voice, sang the litany straight at the ork, heard the words ring back from the darkness as if the Xenia sang with her, finding its own faith and courage. She punched it, dagger between her fingers, full in the face. One eye popped and ran down its hide. Snarling, it pounced forwards. As the punches came in, she threw up her arms, blocking them as she had been taught. She was fast enough, but by the Light, the thing was immensely strong. It hammered at her with fists the size of rams, battering at her head and shoulders. One connected and her ears rang; the force of it snapped her neck over with a painful wrench. The hurt in her hips was climbing her spine like a live thing, all claws and spikes; she could feel something twanging, but she could not stop. Seeing a gap, she struck out with the dagger. It hit, but she might as well have been stabbing a training dummy. The ork snarled, pressing her back, into the pile of bodies behind her. If they fell… How many had died, thrown down here? Lost to the Light, and to their own faith? Watching as the orks ate their shipmates? Knowing they would be next? The thought fuelled her rage, and she surged forwards. She missed a block and the thing pummelled her faceplate. Missed another and one huge fist connected with her chest, sending her backwards with a crunch of crumpled armour. She kicked down at its knee, hard enough to break the bone. It growled and stumbled. Then it came back upright, and hit her with a full-charge body slam, its shoulder to her gut. They both went over, into the pile of dead. Her back wrenched, she gritted her teeth against a cry of pain. The corpses were a sliding cascade, a splashing avalanche of bodies that smothered her and the ork both. She struggled and rolled, found herself on her belly with the ork on top of her; she could see nothing but corpses, and the soup-thick mess of the bilge. The ork was upright first; it drove a knee into her back, hard. Pain exploded across her vision. It had a hand on her wrist, was trying to her wrench her armoured shoulder around and back. She struggled, almost crying aloud as her spine crunched with every motion. The thing was so powerful – how could it be so powerful? ‘Sister.’ The word was a hiss, laden with hate. ‘You – not so strong.’ This was not the ribald scorn of the foot-troops upstairs. This beast was something completely else, something dark and sharp and sinister. It said, ‘He – is not here. You die – hopeless.’ She got one arm under her, tried to push herself up. She reached for a prayer, for His courage and Light to fill her body, for the battle-rage that came with the song of His name, but there was no squad, and no harmony. She was alone. Bereft. No Sisters to sing His praises, no weapons to thunder His name… He – is not here. You die – hopeless. Forsaken. The ork drove its weight downwards, knee first. It was still wrenching at her arm. Impossibly, she heard the crack as her armour started to crumple. She must get back to her feet, stop this beast from killing and eating her… Salva nos! Her backplate cracked further. There was a whoosh as the seal gave, and the first freezing touch of the toxic water. She struggled furiously, but could not move. The ork paused, relishing the moment. She could almost hear it grin. Any second now, it would stamp down with its full weight and crush her back like a wet stick. And then… ‘There are times…’ her tutor’s words came back to her, ghosts in the dark, ‘…when He will test you. Pain, dread, death – all of these things are His blessing. And you will face them, Sisters, though they drag barbed hooks through the darkest corners of your soul. When you are at your lowest ebb, facing the very worst of your terrors… that is when He will be watching you.’ Was He here, now, closer than ever, down in these deep, dark depths? The thought was electric, a crackle of terror and energy. She remembered the lesson fully: that courage, like fear, comes from within. With a roar like pure, focused faith, she pushed with her free arm and went over sideways, rolling the ork beneath her armoured weight and shoving it under the water. Ignoring the pain, she flipped herself over and came down on its chest with both knees, whooshing the air from its lungs in a trail of exploding bubbles. It thrashed frantically, but she had it now, and the full weight of her body was keeping it under the water. With a prayer as sharp as the edge of the blade, she brought her punch-dagger down in the thing’s other eye. It spasmed, blood and fluid flowing through the water, but still it struggled on. She rammed the dagger in under its chin, driving it down with all the force she could muster and through the layer of armour. In nomine Eius! And – in His name – the thing, finally, went still. ‘You have faced quite the ordeal, Sister.’ Back on the observer’s deck, Veradis stood with folded arms and a severe expression. ‘For any Sororitas to fight alone in close quarters against an ork – truly, you have faced foe, fear and darkness, and you have been blessed by His strength.’ She raised an eyebrow. ‘However.’ The word had a knell of finality to it, and Augusta inhaled, making her back spike with pain. She said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The Sister Superior said nothing. Her armour, like Augusta’s, bore warmarks – clear signs that the squad had fought their way through to the muster point. At the Ritual of Cleansing, these would be beaten and polished, cleaned until the armour shone once more. In the field, they were badges of honour. Veradis continued, her tone flat. ‘You abandoned your squad, and returned without your weapon.’ Her lean, lined face did not change. ‘Such carelessness is unworthy of an Adepta Sororitas.’ The other members of the squad had closed around them, Lucienne with a brief smile for her friend. They were all ork-battered and sweating, but after Augusta’s ordeal, her feeling of being so lost and alone, she was thankful for every one of them – for their strength and faith, for their closeness and for how much she trusted them. Augusta lifted her chin. ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ ‘Recite for me,’ Veradis said, ‘the third stanza of the fourth book of the War Treatise of Saint Mina.’ Augusta knew the words, they were etched upon her mind and heart. She said, ‘We are Sisters beneath His light. We obey our orders without question. We do not falter. We do not fear. We do not err.’ ‘We do not err,’ Veradis repeated, making the point. ‘There is no excuse for such a lack of vigilance, Sister. We are a family, we work as Sisters should, and our trust in one another must be absolute. If you cannot uphold that trust, you betray yourself, your squad, your commander and your faith. I comprehend that you have faced horrors to return to us – climbing the pile of the dead to reach the light – but to betray the squad’s unity is to leave a hole in our defences. This cannot be borne.’ Augusta could respond only, ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Veradis nodded at her contrition. ‘You will undertake the remainder of this mission with your dagger alone. I have no bolter for you, and the combat discipline will serve as a timely reminder – to sharpen your senses, Sister. And to uphold your faith.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Augusta felt her face flush, but it was the only reply she could give. Veradis nodded again, her expression softening. ‘Yet, I comprehend what you have faced to return to us. In His name, and in the name of Saint Mina herself, Augusta, I am glad that you are back. I would hate to have lost your strong arm in this most forsaken of places.’ A flicker of a smile crossed her face. ‘See to your armour, Sister, and fear not the lumbering greenskin. We have a mission to complete.’",

      "content": "Sister Augusta Santorus stood at the bottom of the wide stone steps, her scarlet armour gleaming, her head bared to the light. She had entrusted her weapons to the upheld tray of the little brass servitor and she carried only reverence and awe, as was proper in His presence. To bear arms in the house of the Emperor was blasphemy – after all, was His protection not enough? In a line to her left stood her Sisters, the squad’s black-and-white cloaks stirring faintly, though there was little wind in this carefully carved valley. Its rock walls were almost sheer and they glittered with crystalline fragments, reflecting the blue-green gleam of the planet above, hazed in its own atmosphere and glorious to behold. But that was not what held the Sisters’ attention. ‘Truly,’ Sister Superior Veradis said softly, from the centre of the line, ‘one finds His miracles in even the darkest of places. Sing with me, my Sisters…’ ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ They raised their voices in the litany, their harmonies echoing back at them, chiming from the rock. The acoustics were flawless, and Augusta felt a chill go down her back. The darkest of places… This was Caro, the smallest moon of the planet Lena Beta, orbiting its blue-white star. And upon its bleak, rocky surface, there stood a miracle. Forgotten for a thousand years, encased and defended by this carved, rock-walled gorge, it was a great, dark edifice, its bell towers and arches soaring over their heads. That much was imposing enough. But the cathedral was also black. Made from pure, black glass it was shadow, a cut-out, a great silhouette that took towering bites from the planet’s perfect curve. It was flat pane after flat pane, every one held in place by thin struts of dark flexsteel, every one glittering with myriad crystalline reflections. Warrior statues stood guard at its doorway, their strong faces bearing familiar fleur-de-lys tattoos, their carved armour bearing the mark of the Bloody Rose. From the very first days of their Order: their Sisters. Augusta wondered if they judged her, her newness and inexperience. Between the stone Sisters, the cathedral’s huge front doors stood open, and the squad could see that the building’s insides were also dark, lit only by the flickering, ruddy gleam of electro-sconces. Despite the gloom, however, the congregation already waited within. ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to an end, Veradis’ voice sounded in their vox-beads: ‘Witness our Sisters, Farus and Neva. The Accords of the Rose tell us that they defended this moon once before, a thousand years ago. Upon the site of their victory, and in the Emperor’s name, was this cathedral constructed. It is a true phenomenon, the only one of its kind.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Augusta was still staring, transfixed by the wonder that awaited them, nervous of making any misstep. ‘Stand ready,’ Veradis said. Ahead of them, the organ blasted the first notes of the hymn of greeting. ‘And move!’ The squad formed up, double file, and stamped crisply up the steps. Her boots ringing from the stone, the young Sister Augusta marched with her chin up, her gaze straight ahead. With a rustle, the congregation came to their feet, their dataslates in their hands and already flowing with the text of the hymn. The slates’ pale light reflected from the people’s faces and throats – dignitaries all, their robes and jewellery sparkling. Expectation rose from them like smoke. At the aisle’s far end, the great Sol-facing window was as black as everything else, its images lost to opacity. The altar was a great block of dark stone, the organ-pipes all but unseen in the shadows of the steel-supported roof. Only the pulpit and the choirstalls retained any glimmer of light, and, as the Sisters approached, so the choir took up the words of the hymn, their harmonies shiveringly perfect. The darkest of places. Beautiful, incredible though this was, something about this great building made Augusta tense – it provoked a sense of anticipation, almost, a feeling of huge expectation. The squad were here as an honour guard, marking its reconsecration, but still… In the pulpit, the deacon eyed her as if he could see her very thoughts. With a prayer for the unworthiness of the doubt, she lowered her gaze and remembered her humility. Nodding sternly, the deacon joined the hymn. Broadcast out through the vox-coder, his bass boom rose to the black glassaic roof, its power making Augusta’s arms prickle. It seemed almost as if the hymn would shatter the building asunder, bring it down in a tumble of glittering and sharp-edged fragments… Her tension grew sharper, whetted like a good blade. Levis est mihi! Show me the Light! They came to the altar rail, and spread out to kneel. Augusta’s blonde hair fell over her face, but even as it did so… ‘By the Throne!’ The soft exclamation came from Veradis – startling from the severe and disciplined Sister Superior. Before them, the very tip of the Sol window was touched with Lena’s rising light. Augusta stared, rapt. Slowly, the light spread down through the glassaic. And not only through the window; it pooled out through the walls, and across the great arched curve of the roof. It chased the darkness away, turning panes of shadow into panes of pure, blue-white light. Rainbows danced in the vaults of the ceiling; the ruddy gleam of the sconces paled as the pillars rippled with dazzling illumination. They had known to expect this – as this tiny moon curved about its planet, as the planet curved about its star, so this, its singular conjunction, came again. It was the only time in a thousand years that the light touched the bottom of this valley, the site of the previous battle, and the glassaic of the building it now contained. But still, the wonder of it…! Augusta knew she should lower her head, but she could not look away. Illumination flowed down through the great window, revealing Him in all His glory, His armour gleaming, His flaming blade upheld. The singing rose to a crescendo, a crashing celebration of His presence, and of the great victory that had taken place here. It carried a strong contralto line that picked up the thread of the Sisters’ own litany. Again, she shivered. She could not avert her gaze, she was transfixed – the light continued to spread, making the polished brass of the organ pipes shine. It made rainbow patterns slide down the aisle; it brought a gleam to the circling cherubim, their metal eyelids clicking as they surveyed the scene below. Overcome and breathless, bereft of the words of hymn and litany both, Augusta could only watch. The splintering of the roof took the Sisters completely by surprise. And the screams rang like music. ‘This will be a straightforward reconnaissance mission,’ Veradis had told them, in the back of the shuttle. ‘We are to attend the reconsecration of the great crystal cathedral, upon the mining moon Caro. The building is a true marvel, commemorating the victory of Sister Superior Farus against the xenos contagion that had infected Caro’s tunnels.’ She surveyed her squad, her expression stern. ‘You have studied your texts, I hope?’ The Arvus juddered as it hit the upper atmosphere. Sister Leona answered, ‘Most certainly. Caro has an odd, elliptical orbit about its planet, pulled back once every thousand years before being flung out into the void once more. Its resources, however, are considerable, and, after the Great Crusade, the planetary governor deemed it enough of a blessing to be mined for its gemstones. It has brought its planet great wealth.’ ‘Just so,’ Veradis said. The Arvus continued to shudder. Augusta, her helm between her knees, held onto her straps and prayed – this was never her favourite part of a mission. Sister Pia, the squad’s second, chimed in, reciting the text verbatim: ‘But lo! From the unsanctified places of the Emperor’s tunnels there came forth darkness unendurable, heresy manifest in claw and tooth, in hunger given form. And, though the humble servants of the Emperor’s mines gave battle with great bravery, the beasts were a seethe of cruelty beyond their ken, and thus, they were slain.’ Veradis nodded, approving. The pict screen in the back of the shuttle was showing the moon’s long orbit. ‘They survived long enough to call for help,’ Veradis said. ‘And Sister Superior Farus, may she rest in His grace, brought her squad to eliminate the menace. The crystal cathedral marks the site of our Sisters’ triumph, and the point at which the xenos infection was finally purged.’ Veradis paused, watching the pict screen and the slowly tumbling moon. ‘Caro’s atmosphere has been fully restored, and the mines will commence their formal reopen­ing once the service has taken place. We are to attend this service, and then undertake our reconnaissance mission. Needless to say, my Sisters, extreme vigilance must be maintained at all times.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ She gave Augusta a long look, ‘And no mistakes this time, Sister.’ Augusta looked at her red boots, shamed by the loss of her bolter on their previous mission. ‘I will make no errors.’ ‘Good.’ Veradis’ tone was grim. ‘His eyes will be upon you. As will mine.’ The shuttle’s juddering smoothed as the vehicle settled to a level flight path. On the screen, the orbit-image had given way to a close-up of the moon itself, riddled with a familiar pattern of mines, chimneys and manufactoria. Across the bottom of the screen flowed the necessary data – hours of daylight, atmospheric components, pollutant levels, air temperature. Next to Augusta, Sister Lucienne shot her a sideways look. Across their tight-beam vox-link she muttered, ‘Why do I bear a shadow in my heart, Sister? It is unworthy. And yet, there is something about this…’ Augusta glanced at her friend, but did not reply. The same shadow had crossed her also. The crash was tremendous. Glass splintered and tumbled, its edges glittering. A thousand dancing reflections spun across the shattered roof. People came to their feet, shocked, backing up… As a huge, dark shape crunched to the floor amid a smash of fallen shards. Instantly, reflexively, Augusta went for her bolter, but her gauntlet came back empty. Her heart pounding, she was on her feet, turning, drawing the small fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour. Around her, her Sisters were doing the same, each woman dropping to a guarded crouch. In the centre of the nave, a colossal, savage monster bared huge teeth at the fleeing congregation. The people were shrieking, now, gathering their robes and their families and scrambling out of the way. Panicking and shoving, they tumbled from its impact like ripples. By the Light! Augusta stared at it, her hand tightening on her blade. What is that? It was huge, pure savagery, and far bigger than the Sisters; its carapace was a glitter of spine-spiked darkness in the now brilliant rainbow light. It crouched, its tail lashing, whipping its head this way and that as it watched the fleeing, shrieking people. The hymn had tumbled from the air like a broken thing. In the pulpit, the deacon raged, leaning down to rant like fanatic. ‘This is the house of the Emperor! There will be no defilement here!’ He rounded on the Sisters, blazing zeal and fury, but Veradis was already moving. ‘Squad,’ she snapped into the vox. ‘With me, by twos, watch each other’s backs. Leona, get to the vestibule and secure the heavy bolter.’ Aloud, she roared, ‘Get out of the way!’ The people, already scrabbling, had no need to be told. As the Sisters closed ranks and began to move, the crowd was stumbling over the seating, tripping and crunching over the fallen glassaic. The braver amongst them had been trying to build some sort of hasty barricade, but it was a pitiful attempt – the thing’s claws were as long as a Sister’s forearm and they lashed a lethal left-right, sending pews and bodies flying. Snarling and screaming echoed loudly, the noises carrying as perfectly as the words of the hymn had done. ‘Sisters!’ Veradis barked the order aloud. ‘On the double!’ They broke into a run, their metal feet clanging a challenge. Each woman had her punch-dagger in her grip; in the lead, Veradis was using her free hand to pull the slower or less wary people clean out of her way. The litany came from her like pure, cold outrage. From the lightning and the tempest! The creature did not care. It was a boil of motion, a cyclone of violence. Its speed was terrifying. It was a harbinger of death, its tail like a whip, its claws ripping through flesh and stone alike. In a blur of speed, its huge maw bit at a fleeing dignitary. The man’s headless body ran another full step before it fell forwards, its ringed hands outstretched. Blood pooled from the neck. The creature pounced again, picking up a robed woman and tearing her clean in half. Shocked, horrified, her gorge rising with a toxic alloy of fury and nausea, Augusta almost skidded; she had to force herself to keep running, to maintain the litany’s defiant song. The people were almost all out of the way now, but the creature was already flanked by piles of flung bodies, some of them only injured, desperate and struggling. Ignoring them, focused now on the Sisters, it slashed through the nearest heap and jumped on a fallen pew, all spine and spike and tail, a knot of shoulders and claws. Its shining head turned towards Veradis and it extended a long tongue, tasting the air. For a split second, Augusta wondered if it was grinning at them. But this was no time for such whimsical nonsense. Our Emperor, deliver us! The floor was slick with scarlet; it steamed in the bright, crystal light, and wreathed the monster like an aura. ‘Xenos.’ Veradis’ snarl didn’t even sound surprised. ‘We do not fear you, creature.’ The thing tilted its head at her, almost as if it understood. From the pulpit, the deacon was still roaring: ‘Defiler! Slay it, Sister Superior, in the Emperor’s name!’ The creature leapt. Barehanded, bereft of both bolter and chainsword, Veradis did not hesitate. Fearless, she met it head-on, catching it as it leapt, and throwing it over and past her. It landed on its back, kicked frantically for a moment, and then righted itself. It spun snarling, lowering its head at them. ‘Go, get out!’ Behind Augusta, Sister Lucienne was ushering the last of the people, pushing them towards the two side doors that led back out to the cloisters, and to the high, tight walls of the valley. Horrified, their faces etched in terror and sickness, streaked by blood and tears, they followed her directions, pulling each other away. One of them, a young man barely older than Lucienne herself, clutched at her and said, ‘Why? What did we do to merit such punishment?’ ‘This is not punishment,’ she told him, her tone livid with suppressed outrage. ‘This is an abomination. And it will be purged!’ He nodded, though his eyes were as much glass as the great building itself. ‘Run!’ she told him. But Augusta had reached the fight. The thing was upright, all four arms mantled over its head; it was leering down at Veradis, its horrific teeth still bared. Augusta looked up at it, gauging its weapons, its weak points, its potential attacks. Images lashed at her, memories of the schola’s lessons – but she could never have guessed that such a beast would be this cold, this utterly pure and focused. And so fast! Snarling, it lunged at Veradis with each set of massive claws, left and right, one after the other. They tore through her armour as if it were only grox-leather, ripping huge parallel dents in her breastplate and pauldrons; but the Sister Superior was indomitable, she did not falter or fall back. Still singing, rage and battle and defiance, she slashed with the dagger, a sideways lunge aimed at the joints in the beast’s armoured belly. But it moved like a blur, too swift to see. Another set of claws slammed down on Veradis’ shoulder, sending her spinning to the floor. From plague, temptation and war! Over the vox, Sister Pia barked, ‘Spread out!’ The Sisters separated to surround the beast, coming at it from all sides. Its head twitched to and fro as it followed them, its tail lashed at their boots. Our Emperor, deliver us! The thing hissed at them. And then, almost faster than they could see, it exploded into motion. It was like fighting a tornado. Too strong, too many arms, too fast to follow. Glassaic crunched beneath their boots, the rainbow light still spreading over their heads – but they had no time to look up. One savage tail-lash took Lucienne off her feet, dropping her with a thunderous crash. A slash of claws sent Pia reeling, her armour sliced like cloth. The thing’s strength was enormous, its ferocity brutal. The Sisters came at it from every direction, but their daggers seemed to skitter off its carapace; it slashed and stuck at them, and their armour rent and ­buckled under blows too fast to follow. Pia lunged at its back, but it whipped around, lashing out with one huge arm to send her staggering back, slamming into the nearest pillar. As it did so, Augusta struck at its side but the thing’s hard chitin turned the point of her small dagger. The blow skidded, doing no harm. She swore under her breath, and kept singing. From the scourge of the Kraken! From the corner of her eye, she could see that Veradis was back on her feet, though the Sister Superior had not closed back into the melee. Instead, she had discarded her dagger and held her position, watching the monster, her eyes narrow. But Augusta could not stop to consider this – the thing whirled again, its tail knocking Lucienne flying for a second time. Its gleaming, foot-long teeth snapped at Augusta’s arm; its claws lashed hard at her cheek. She yanked her head backwards and it missed her, but only just. She felt the whack of wind as they passed within a whisper of her nose. If those claws caught her, they would take her face clean off. It followed the attack and leapt at her – one slash, and another, and another, each one slamming into her and making her reel. She raised her arms to defend herself; her ears rang with song and fury. The Sisters followed it, pressing in close, stopping the thing moving, preventing it getting away. Blades struck at it from all sides, but its arms were fast, knocking them aside, sending the squad skidding backwards, their boots screeching on the stone. Without their bolters they had nothing that could touch it, and it was almost as if it knew. Amid its chilling focus, it seemed to be mocking them. The deacon was still shouting from the pulpit, almost frothing at the mouth. Augusta lunged again, hard enough to stick her dagger point first into the beast’s chest, but she lost her grip on the weapon as the monster whipped around. It turned too fast, taking the blade with it. It snapped its teeth downwards at Pia’s shoulder. For an instant, they crunched on ceramite, then Pia dropped to one knee and they slammed shut on air. An instant later, Pia was back on her feet, her song twisting into a vicious, stubborn curse. How could they stop this thing? Panic was beginning to swell in Augusta’s chest, though she would not succumb to it. How was this accursed thing even here? Our Emperor, deliver us! Beside her, Sister Pia raised the litany once more. Clenching her gauntleted fists, Augusta closed again – but the beast barely even noticed. She might as well have been hitting the rock wall. Then she saw her dagger, sticking from the thing’s carapace. She made a grab for it, catching it and pulling it free. Snarling, the beast whirled again. It hurled itself straight at her, its teeth bared, all four sets of claws coming for her chest. She threw up her arms in a cross block, felt the force of its impact through her elbows and shoulders, but she could not stand in its path, it was just too big. It smashed her to the floor, hurled itself past her and spun, turning back to the squad. Another claw strike, a reaching left-right, and Sister Lucienne was falling, dark fluid staining the rips in her armour. In His name! You will not do this! Sister Emlyn leaned down and pulled Lucienne out of the way. Augusta kept striking, slashing, singing, distracting its attention. How was it here? Had it always been here, surviving a thousand years from the previous battle? Had it been waiting, hiding somewhere outside this valley, just waiting for the… Waiting for the light. By the Throne! The realisation struck her like a claw. Of course. It had been here all along, dormant, curled about itself in patient stillness, and the very conjunction that had brought life and light back to the cathedral – it had touched this thing, and roused it from its stasis. Had brought it, leaping, and tearing, and hungry, into their midst. Furious at its sacrilege, at its presence, at the memory of their Sisters that it had now despoiled, she threw herself at it. The squad moved with her, all of them closing once more about its flanks. Over the vox, Veradis barked, ‘Pia! Now!’ ‘Aye.’ Her movements absolutely precise, Sister Pia grabbed the thing’s extended tongue in one red-gauntleted hand. With a single, deft twist, she wrapped it around her wrist and brought its head down into her raised knee. There was a sharp crack, and its teeth closed on its own flesh. Gore and squeals spurted from its mouth. The Sister Superior roared, ‘Leona! Fire!’ From the far side of the now empty nave came the unmistakeable metallic cocking of the heavy bolter. Veradis bawled, ‘Down!’ Augusta was moving, even as the Sister Superior wrapped an arm over her shoulders. They crashed to the floor together. The thunder was tremendous. A full directed burst roared across the air. It cut though the pews, through the glassaic, and though the chitinous hide of the monster. The heavy bolter boomed its song of death, the noise immense. White-light panes shattered as rounds blew them outwards. On the floor, face down on the glass-pebbled stone and half-crushed by Veradis’ weight, Augusta couldn’t see – but she could hear the creature scream in pain and fury, hear it thrashing as the rounds bit home. She heard its claws as it turned and ran, hurling itself bodily across the nave and towards Leona. But Leona was still firing, steady and unintimidated. Her voice over the vox sang defiance. Bring them only death! Veradis shifted, was back on her feet. Augusta, too, started to stand up. From out of the corner of her eye she saw Luci­enne, bloodied and battered and rolling back to her knees; saw Sister Emlyn, shaking herself, but moving. Saw Sister Pia, lying curled on her side, blood sliding from her mouth, her armour smoking from multiple holes. What? Only one weapon made scars like those. In the vestibule, the heavy bolter was still firing, its muzzle tracking the incoming beast. Leona had stepped back, given herself the full range and rate of fire; the monster was spraying thick, dark blood, shuddering under the onslaught, but it was still coming, climbing over the pews as if nothing could bring it down… But Sister Pia lay still. Facing the monster, Leona was still singing, her voice rising as the thing closed on her; she was back to the wall, now, had nowhere else to go. The deacon was still in his pulpit, still bellowing orders… But Sister Pia lay still. Stunned, Augusta watched as the heavy bolter started to cough. Leona swore, knowing she was down to her last few rounds, but she still kept firing as the monster skidded the last pews out of its way… But Sister Pia lay still. ‘By the Throne.’ Over the vox, Leona cursed aloud. ‘You’ll go down if I have to beat you to death myself!’ With a final rumble, the heavy bolter clacked loudly, and stopped. The silence was suddenly tremendous, echoing in Augusta’s ears. But – finally – the monster was down. Barely two feet from where Leona was standing, it had crashed to the floor, its chitin cracked, its arms splayed, its body coated in its own fluids. Its rear claws kicked once, and were still. The deacon cried, ‘Yes! Thank the Emperor!’ but they did not look up at him. Because Sister Pia lay still. Calmly, Veradis said, ‘Be sure, Leona.’ Her voice was full – victory, sacrifice, sadness. ‘Aye.’ Boots sounded as Leona walked over to the thing, her heavy bolter still in her hands. The single shot to its skull rang out like the last line of a hymn. ‘One round left in the chamber,’ she said, quietly. Like the presence of their small, hidden daggers, no one needed to ask her why it was there. But Sister Pia had not moved. ‘Her death was not your doing,’ Veradis said, one hand on Sister Leona’s shoulder. ‘It was a risk, and Sister Pia understood. We fight as the Emperor decrees.’ Leona’s lean, lined face was stone hard, her chin lifted, as if she kept any emotions to herself. At their feet, Sister Pia lay crumpled upon a bed of ­shattered glassaic, her black hair spread out, her expression frozen in the bared-teeth determination of pure combat. All down one side of her armour there were the telltale holes made by the heavy bolter. Her courage had enabled them to injure the beast, and had forced it to react to the weapon, rather than killing the rest of the squad. They – and the people – owed Pia their lives. Augusta knew that sacrifice was the greatest honour to which a Sister could aspire, but she had never before seen it in the field, and she stayed silent, looking down at Pia’s fallen form. She seemed so small. Veradis, however, was glaring at the deacon. ‘You declared this location secure.’ It was not a question. The deacon had not lost his pompousness. He was a small, round man, and he puffed himself up before answering: ‘How was I to know that your long-lost Sisters had not purged this moon completely? The failure is yours, Sororitas, not mine.’ Veradis eyed him as if she would break him in half, but said nothing. Instead, she said to the squad, ‘Retrieve your weapons. I want every doorway guarded. There will be no service here until we deploy fully through the tunnels and ensure that there are no further,’ she eyed the deacon, ‘surprises.’ ‘Aye.’ The Sisters did as they were ordered, but Augusta paused, Lucienne beside her. ‘Sister Superior, a question, if I may?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘This is the house of the Emperor. We do not bear weapons–’ ‘You’re asking why He did not defend us, Sister?’ Veradis’ tone held a certain wry amusement, perhaps at Augusta’s inexperience. ‘As the Scriptures would have us believe?’ Feeling the gazes of both deacon and Sister Superior, Augusta looked down at Pia’s fallen body and nodded. ‘Is that so foolish a question? How could such a creature be permitted…’ The deacon glowered at her. ‘He does not come when you call, Sister…’ Veradis held up a hand, and he quietened, tapping his foot. The Sister Superior said, ‘The xenos knows no respect. And what are we but His defence? What are we but His weapons? Twice now, you have faced foes without your bolter, and twice, you have triumphed. This is a test of our faith and mettle, like any other, wherever it may take place.’ Augusta stole a look at the now shining window, remembering the stone Sisters that stood at the doorway. ‘Our Sisters did not fail?’ ‘That is not for us to judge.’ Veradis shot the deacon a sideways glare. ‘We only do as we are bid, by His presence. You may grieve for Sister Pia, in the proper time, but you must first follow your orders.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Have no fear,’ Veradis said, her face softening to a rare smile. ‘Sister Pia stands before the Throne, and she does so in honour, her life given in battle.’ She glanced at the fallen creature, drawing Augusta’s attention and making the point. ‘We can only pray that, one day, we will be so blessed.’",

      "content": "The cathedral’s corpse was vast. Standing in its hollow heart, its darkness vaulted huge above her, Sister Superior Augusta rested one scarlet-gauntleted hand on the bolter at her hip. She said nothing, only scanned this icon of the Emperor’s might, searching for motion, for threat, for any remaining gleam of His light. But there was nothing. This was Ultima Segmentum’s darkest corner, and little reached out here. Beside her, the missionary Lysimachus Tanichus was speaking in hushed tones. ‘From the last years of the Age of Apostasy, Sister. Or so they say.’ His sibilance coiled in the dark, like echoes of millennia. Augusta gave a brief acknowledgement and walked carefully through the debris. The air was hot here, clammy with the overgrown jungle-marsh outside; twisted creepers had penetrated the cathedral’s crumbling walls and they writhed across the stonework like the tendrils of Chaos itself. Sweat itched at the fleur-de-lys tattoo on her cheek. ‘Sisters.’ She spoke softly into the vox at her throat. ‘Roll call.’ Five voices came back through the darkness. Augusta’s retinal lenses tracked their locations: blips deployed in a standard sweep-reconnaissance pattern. Her squad were experienced – all except one – and she had complete trust in their worthiness, and in their love for the Emperor. Together, they had carried fist and faith across every segmentum of the galaxy. Tanichus, fiddling with his rosarius, spoke again. ‘The Emperor’s light had not touched this world in millennia, Sister, not until I came here, carrying His name. The local townspeople told me of the cathedral. It’s a part of their mythology–’ ‘I trust you’ve brought them Truth,’ Augusta said. Her authority was unthreatened by the missionary, but she needed to listen – the brief from the canoness on Ophelia VII had listed this world as a potential staging point for Chaos, invading from the Eye of Terror, for witchkin or renegades, for marauding xenos of every kind. Augusta was a twenty-year veteran, her bobbed hair and stern gaze both steel-grey, and her experience made her both sharp and wary. ‘Me serve vivere, Sister,’ Tanichus said. ‘I live to serve.’ ‘Sister Jatoya,’ Augusta said into the vox. ‘Anything?’ Her second-in-command responded, ‘No, Sister. If there’s anything here, it’s well hidden.’ ‘Check everywhere.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Very well.’ Her touch still on the bolter, eyeing the decaying statues and pillars above her, Augusta gestured for Tanichus to keep speaking. But he told her only what she already knew: his history with the townspeople, and their rumours of the cathedral. The town held the place taboo, but they’d told Tanichus their local myth – that the ruin had a guardian, an armoured stone icon with a bloodied flower upon its chest. And Tanichus had carried word of this back to the Ecclesiarchy, and to the Sisters. A member of the Order of the Bloody Rose, Augusta had volunteered for the mission immediately – with the cathedral’s age, it was possible that the icon could be Saint Mina herself. ‘The Emperor has called me,’ she’d said to the canoness. ‘And I must go.’ Perhaps for more political reasons than visionary ones, the canoness had agreed. Her boots crunching over ancient, fallen masonry, Augusta climbed the steps towards the high altar. Ruin or not, she paused before the top and dropped to one armoured knee, her black cloak billowing and her hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on her armour. ‘Quantus tremor est futurus, quando attingit locum Lucis.’ How great the fear will be, when the Light touches this place! She felt the missionary shiver as he, too, knelt. Tanichus was a talker, a good man to carry the Emperor’s word, but she was His daughter, and her task was clear. She would find this icon. ‘Did the townspeople tell you anything further?’ she asked, coming back to her feet. ‘You lived with them for several months.’ ‘Only superstitions,’ he told her. ‘If this is your patron saint, Sister, then we must find her without their help.’ Augusta nodded. She gave her squad orders to structure their search, to move in a standard skirmish pattern throughout the cathedral’s cloisters and side-rooms. Sister Viola, the youngest, she ordered to stand guard at the fallen doors. Viola was new from the schola; she was high-hearted and eager to prove herself and that was all very well… but Augusta wanted her close. ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola, bolter in hand, returned to the doors and took her position, watching the huge and muggy writhe of the outside jungle. Over the vox, the Sister Superior recited the Litany of Mettle. Whatever was here, they would find it. In the cathedral’s transept stood a colossal thirty-foot statue, its broken hands raised in the sign of the aquila. It had been carved in full armour and, like all such things, it faced Holy Terra as if it still sought the Light. But if this was Saint Mina, then she had no face, and her insignia had long since fallen to dust. Augusta was scanning, carefully looking for age and identity, when the cry came from Viola at the doorway. ‘Sisters!’ The word was soft across the vox, but it carried the faintest of quivers. ‘I see movement!’ Augusta felt the touch of adrenaline and inhaled, enjoying the lift, the first flush of faith – as her briefing had warned her, this was a dangerous place. ‘Be specific,’ she said, turning to crunch back out to the nave, the cathedral’s main aisle. ‘What do you see?’ ‘Large force incoming. Seventy, eighty yards. Moving slowly, but heading this way.’ Her voice was taut with fear. ‘It’s hard to see them through the jungle.’ Tanichus followed at Augusta’s shoulder. The missionary had unhooked his lasrifle and looked slightly queasy; she hoped he could shoot straight. ‘Sisters, to me. Kimura, to the doorway. Jatoya, watch the rear.’ Kimura carried the squad’s heavy bolter, and its faster suppression would be critical. ‘Viola, description.’ ‘I can’t see well, Sister, but they’re all shoulders. They’re huge!’ ‘Space Marines?’ Jatoya’s tone was surprised. ‘Out here?’ But Kimura was at the doorway now, weapon at the ready. Her voice came back over the vox, her tones shuddering with a rising, burning eagerness. ‘They’re not Heretic Astartes, Sisters.’ The words were alight. ‘They’re orks.’ Orks. If there was one damned xenos that Augusta loathed, it was the ork. Filthy, stinking things, slavering and disorderly; they were as much the enemies of the Throne as any witch or heretic. She could feel her faith unfurling in her heart like a banner – she had a chance to reclaim this holy place, at the edge of the segmentum… But Augusta’s ruthless discipline was what had kept her alive through twenty years of warfare. She could embrace the love of her Emperor and keep her thoughts clear. She reached Kimura at the doorway, and used her auspex to look outside. Immediately, she saw why Viola had made the mistake. Many of the incoming beasts were enormous, bigger than the Sisters, armour and all. But this was not the disciplined advance of highly-trained soldiers, this was ramshackle, and noisy, and slow. The orks moved more like marauders; they laughed amongst themselves, pushing and shoving and snarling. Their tones were harsh and their voices guttural. They were hard to see through the steam, through the festooned and looping creepers. But they were heading straight for the cathedral. ‘Sister!’ Kimura had reached the same conclusion – her voice was tense. Augusta saw her take a sight on the lead ork, anger radiating from her stance as if her armour burned with it. ‘Hold your fire.’ For a moment, she thought Kimura would disobey, but Augusta’s command of her squad was too strong. Instead, Kimura paused, quivering, her finger on the trigger, tracking the orks as they approached. Behind them now, Viola’s breathing was swift in her vox. She was afraid – and Augusta understood. But still, the youngest of the squad had to control herself, and quickly. Swiftly, the Sister Superior gave orders for deployment. Kimura and Caia at the door, Viola and Melia at the front left archway, Jatoya, with her flamer, watching the rear. Augusta herself, Tanichus still with her, took position at the front arch to the right, its window long since put out by the creeper and shattered to forgotten dust. Outside, the orks advanced, oblivious. A fight had broken out amongst their number, cheered and jeered by those surrounding. Beneath her helmet, Augusta curled her lip – she had no fear of these beasts, whatever their numbers. Over the vox, she recited the Battle Hymnal and heard her Sisters join her, avidly soft. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ She felt Viola stiffen, felt her courage coalesce. She felt Kimura steady, ready to unleash His wrath on the incoming creatures and their blasphemous intentions… ‘Wait,’ she said, again. The orks moved closer. Within heavy bolter range. Within bolter range. Any moment now, they would see the crouching Sisters, their blood-scarlet armour and their black-and-white cloaks… ‘Sisters, stay down. Kimura, on my command, full covering suppression. For the Emperor… Fire!’ The orks had no idea what had hit them. Raiders and warriors alike, everything vanished in a hail of gore and shredding flesh. The heavy bolter howled in Kimura’s hands, and the jungle was ripped to pieces, leaves shining like shrapnel, trees and vines cut clean in half. One ancient trunk toppled over with a groan, but was stopped by a tangle of creeper. It hung there, creaking, like some huge executioner’s axe. Kimura’s voice came over the vox, louder now, ‘A morte perpetua, Domine, libra nos!’ The Hymn of Battle raged in tune with the furious barking of the weapon. The Sisters’ voices joined her, rising to crystal-pure harmonics as Kimura visited bloody destruction upon the orks. Augusta was grinning now, tight and violent beneath her helm. She knew this with every word in her ear, every flash in her blood – this was her worship, her purpose and her life. The Emperor Himself was with her, His fire in her heart, His touch in the creak and weight of her armour, in the bolter in her hand. She was here to unleash His wrath against the despoilers of this forgotten and holy place. And it felt good. At her other hip, her heavy chainsword clanked as if begging for release, but not yet… not yet. She heard Kimura’s singing ring with vehemence as the Sister cut the orks to pieces. ‘From the blasphemy of the Fallen, our Emperor, deliver us!’ But orks, despite many flaws, had no concept of intimidation. They had no interest in the Emperor’s wrath, no tactics, and no sense. Another force might have gone to ground, given covering fire, but not these beasts. Roaring with outrage, waving what clumsy weapons they had, they simply charged. Over the singing, Augusta shouted, ‘Kimura, fall back and reload! The rest of you, fire!’ She raised her own bolter, aiming for the largest ork she could see. Greenskins had a very simple rule of leadership – the bigger the beast, the more control it wielded. And if she could take out the leaders, the rest would be easier to kill. The battle hymn still sounded and she added her voice once again, feeling the music thrill along her nerves like wildfire. A second wave of orks raged forwards, leering and eager. There seemed to be no end to them. The beasts were closing fast now, and she could see them clearly: their jutting teeth and green skin, their rusted weapons, their armour all scrappy pieces of ceramite and steel, scrounged from who knew what battlefields. One had a set of white pauldrons bearing the distinctive fleur-de-lys. Snarling, she blew it away. But their losses didn’t touch them; they picked up the weapons of their dying and their trampled, and they just kept coming. Bolters barked and howled in red-gauntleted hands. Tanichus took single shots with his lasrifle, picking his targets carefully. The jungle became a mess of blood and smoke and noise, but still the orks came on, slobbering and shouting, ripping through creepers and fallen trees. To one side, there was a lashing and a gurgle and half a dozen greenskins vanished, shrieking and struggling, below the surface of the marsh. Jeers and calls came from the rest, but they didn’t slow down. ‘There’s too many of them!’ The youngest Sister’s cry broke the hymn’s purity and Augusta felt her squad waver. She raised her voice to a paean, a clarion call like a holy trumpet, allowing them no pause. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Shrieking with fury, Viola resumed firing. But the orks didn’t care. They tore themselves free from the jungle’s tangle and threw themselves at the steps. The lead ork went backwards in a spray of crimson mist. The others were already boiling past it. Tanichus kept firing, streaks of light past Augusta’s shoulder. Augusta switched to full suppression and heard the bolters of the others, all growling in righteous fury. Yet the orks still came. They were like a rotting green tide, large creatures and small, no structure, no fear. They bayed and snarled like animals. The Sisters couldn’t stop them all. Fury rose in Augusta and was annealed to a magnesium-white flare of righteous wrath. You shall not enter here! Viola, afraid, screamed the words of the hymnal, the same verse, over and over… The advance stopped. Shredded leaves fluttered slowly to the rotting jungle floor. The orks had paused. Changing magazine with an action so reflexive she barely noticed, Augusta scanned them through her retinal lenses, wondering what in Dominica’s name they were doing. Had they just been overcome by the holiness of the cathedral itself? Somehow, she doubted it. She watched as the creatures at the front moved, taking cover behind toppled statues. She gave the order to keep firing and heard the bolters start again. The beasts knew the Sisters were here – and they’d responded. Smart orks? The idea was horrifying. Yet something down there – the warboss or whatever it was – had intelligence. It made her wonder if their presence was pure coincidence… and an odd chill went down her back. The lead orks had taken cover now, and the jungle was ominously quiet. Behind them, through the rising steam, she could see bigger figures, moving forwards. Several had stubby sidearms, luridly decorated; the weapons gave a steady bark of fire. Rounds chewed chunks out of the stone and made the Sisters keep their heads down. And one of them– ‘Get back from the windows! Take cover!’ Her squad were already on the move, throwing themselves back. They didn’t wait for the ork with the rocket launcher to loose his leering-skull-painted missile… straight into the cathedral nave. Augusta hit the floor, taking Tanichus down with her. The world erupted in fire. She heard the whistling of shrapnel, felt the whoosh of heat that seared her armour and shrivelled her cloak to tatters. The orks would use the cover of the missile to gain entrance to the building, and she was back on her feet, even as the flame was dying. ‘Sisters! Roll call!’ Tanichus was scrambling up, charred but unhurt – Augusta had covered as much of his unarmoured body as was possible. He was coughing, fumbling for his lasrifle amongst the settling dust. Five voices came back to her, making her thank the Emperor Himself for the courage and experience of her squad. The orks were on them now, piling through the doors, scrambling over the window ledges – if all else failed, Augusta would bring the building down in a final hail of rounds, and kill everything within. For the glory of the Emperor! But they were not done yet. They would fight with the Emperor Himself at their backs, and they would fight to their last breath. ‘Kimura–!’ She started to give orders to fall back, for Kimura’s heavy bolter to cover them, but her voice was lost under the detonation of a grenade, impacting right at Kimura’s feet. The Sister disappeared in a blast of smoke and fragments. Viola screamed. Chunks of roof tumbled to the floor. Tanichus scrabbled away on his backside, his rifle lost. Now, the orks were all over the nave. Augusta could see the smaller, darker gretchins, scuttling in among their boots, picking things up and shaking them and biting them, then scurrying gleefully away. Slinging the bolter, she drew the chainsword and started the mechanism. It snarled into life like pure impatience, eager for the blasphemers’ blood. Called by the rasp of the weapon, the Sisters were upon the orks with fists and feet and fury, punching one, kicking it to the floor, then ripping the axe out of its grip and using it on the one behind. Their armour, already red, slicked brighter with colours of death. But somewhere under the combat-high, Augusta was beginning to understand something: this was not just a random raid, it was too big, too clever, too strong. These orks had come here knowingly. And they’d come expecting resistance. A hand grabbed her cloak and pulled her backwards. She spun the chainsword, slashed through the neck of one ork and into the chest of another. Both went over, one still howling, and her thoughts were forgotten – she had other priorities. Stamping at the impertinent gretchins, she slashed at a third ork, and a fourth. She was wrath incarnate, the rage of the Emperor, carving flesh and bone and armour, and spraying gore like red wine. Tanichus had vanished, somewhere in the mess. Sister Jatoya shouted over the vox – the orks had got round behind them. Clever indeed. The flamer roared as Jatoya retreated, searing the enemy and sending them screaming, burning, stumbling. The wet and seething creepers started to smoke. And then, Augusta saw something else. Warboss. Throne, the beast was big! Seven and a half feet of pure, green muscle. It had metal in its ears, one lower tooth that jutted over its face, and an almost full set of armour that offered more than one well-known symbol – Blood Angels, Imperial Fists, the eight-pointed emblem of Chaos. It was a champion, and the biggest damned ork she’d ever seen. And if that thing was out here scavenging, then she was straight out of the schola. It had a sharp, sly glimmer in its red eyes – and its gaze stopped on Augusta. She snarled at it, ‘Mori blasphemus fui.’ Die, blasphemer. Around them, the melee slowed to a fluid dance of blood and blades. From the corner of her eye, Augusta saw Viola punch her scarlet gauntlet clean into an ork’s face, saw the ork rock backwards, then shake itself and grin. But her attention was still on the leader. Just as its was on her. They were the eye of the storm. The ork carried twin axes, each as long as its muscled forearm, and there was a second grenade at its belt. It said, ‘Sis-tah.’ But the snarl of the chainsword was its only reply. Not only big, but fast. Augusta was used to orks being slow, bearing down an enemy by brute force, rather than by speed or skill. Not this thing. In her mind, she recited the Litany of Blood – a reflex, a chant of pure focus. It was part of her combat training, something she’d learned at the schola, and it made her sharp, the tool of the might that flowed through her. But her first side-slash was blocked, then the second, the rasp of the chainsword rising to a scream as the axes caught in its teeth. The ork didn’t falter. It was controlled and powerful. She went backwards, parrying one blow after another, her boots scattering dust and mess and fallen ork bodies. And it came after her, its breath as foul as its coated yellow teeth. It was still talking; threats and mockery, but she had no interest in bandying words with it. It was defiler and despoiler, and it would die. Another blow, and another. She tried to press forwards, but it gave her no gap in which to strike. Around her, the rest of the squad fought with knives and fists, hammering the orks to a bloody green pulp. She saw one Sister falter, and fall to her knees. ‘Sis-tah.’ Grinning, the monster dropped both axes. It grabbed the chainsword, blades and all, in one massive hand, and tore it out of her grasp. It threw it aside. She saw Jatoya’s flamer in the corner of her vision, saw Caia and Melia together pick an ork up bodily and hurl it into a gathering of its fellows, sending all of them scattering to the floor. They would win this! It almost made her laugh, the sound like pure, righteous joy. With only her gauntlets, she threw herself at the monster. But it was too fast – it grabbed her, its chainsword-carved hand around her gorget, and it lifted her clean off the floor. Furious now, she kicked it. Again. Again. She split the beast’s lip, but its grin only widened, its teeth now streaked with its own blood. Furious, she took its wrist in her gasp and tried to twist and crush its arm, force it to drop her. It shook her like an errant underling. ‘Sister!’ Across the vox, she heard Jatoya’s cry. Her second in command couldn’t use her flamer but Jatoya barked a clear order at the rest of the squad. ‘Take it down!’ The warboss didn’t care. It shook her again, her armour clattering. ‘Sis-tah,’ it said. ‘Know you. Came to find.’ What? ‘Wait!’ The word was a gurgle over the vox. The beast was laughing at her. ‘We take all. Kill sis-tahs. Take weapons.’ Understanding grew up her spine like ice. She stared at the ork as it shook her for the third time. Take weapons. It had known that the Sisters were here! The fighting around them was beginning to lessen. The orks were faltering, and the Sisters hacked at them without mercy, driving them back. Many of the smaller beasts were dropping their weapons and running away. Jatoya had slung her flamer and fought with her fists alone; Augusta saw her punch an ork in the back of the neck, saw it stumble to its knees. One red-armoured figure – she couldn’t tell who – was walking through the mess, bolter in hand, putting single shots into struggling heaps. Another was clearing the bodies from the altar steps, and she could see the broken form of Kimura, smoke still rising from the joints in her armour. Then she saw one Sister click the neck of her helm and remove it, revealing a freckled face and bobbed red hair, all tousled and sweating. Viola. Her expression was like acid-carved steel. ‘Put her down.’ Viola raised her bolter, and took clear aim at the ork’s head. The warboss paused. Augusta saw it look round at its defeated force; saw its red eyes narrow, its lip curl. Then it let her go, and she fell, crashing to her knees on the cathedral floor. Viola came closer, the bolter aimed and steady. The ork bared its teeth at her. Impressed with the new mettle of the youngest Sister, Augusta stood up. She stepped in close to the warboss and said, ‘You knew we were here.’ Talking to the thing made her flesh crawl, but she had to know. ‘How? Who told you?’ ‘Sis-tah.’ The warboss looked from Augusta to Viola and back. It cocked its head to one side and said, ‘So fool-ish. So tiny.’ Augusta glared at it. ‘How did you know?’ ‘Blood Axes.’ It thumped the crossed-axe symbol on its chest. ‘We kill. Take weapons.’ She held its red gaze. Augusta had heard of the Blood Axes, they traded with humans sometimes – it might explain why this monster was so damned clever. But not how it had known– Tanichus. The realisation came like the Light of the Emperor Himself – a ray of pure Truth. Tanichus had been here before – had lived here for months – and only Tanichus had known that the Sisters were coming. And, as Augusta remembered, he’d used his local knowledge to set the time of their reconnaissance. He’d told them when to be here. ‘Get the missionary.’ She snapped the command over the vox, saw Caia nod and turn away. ‘What did he offer you?’ she said to the warboss. It sneered at her, its red eyes cold. Reached for the grenade at its belt. She saw the motion, went to kick its wrist – but Viola was faster. Her face like stone, the youngest Sister shot it clean through the head. Gore spattered. The huge beast teetered for a second, almost as if startled – then it crashed to the floor like a tree falling. The whole building seemed to shake. A pool of crimson spread out across the flagstones. ‘Good shot,’ Augusta told the youngest Sister. Viola grinned. Behind them, Caia had returned with Tanichus, the missionary almost gibbering with fear. ‘Found him trying to flee,’ Caia said. ‘Scuttling out of the crypt like an insect.’ ‘Sister!’ The missionary was white-faced; he looked like he was about to vomit. Her armour still dripping, she walked over to him, closing her hand about his neck just like the ork’s had been about her own. He looked at her, his eyes wide, his mouth open. ‘Sister Superior, I swear by His light–’ ‘You dare? You dare swear by the Emperor’s name?’ Her hand closed; she felt his breath catch in his throat. ‘I should crush you where you stand.’ ‘Sister, please!’ At her feet, the warboss lay dead. The orks were finished and the Sisters had closed ranks at Augusta’s shoulders – the entire cathedral seemed gathered at her back, looking at the missionary. ‘You’ve been here before,’ Augusta said. ‘Lived with the townspeople. You’re the link, Tanichus. You’re the only thing that could have manipulated the pieces. Tell me, did you speak to the orks? Deal with them? Did you lie about the icon? Something to bring us out here, just so the orks could kill us for our weapons.’ She shook him like a rat. ‘Sister, I swear!’ Disgusted, she let him go, watched as Caia’s gauntleted hands closed on his shoulders and forced him to his knees. ‘Sister Kimura died,’ Augusta said. She freed the seal on her helm and took it off, enjoying the relative cool of the marsh-thick air. Meeting her flat, steel gaze, Tanichus was starting to panic. ‘Please!’ She dropped to one knee, gripped his jaw in one bloody gauntlet and forced him to look at her. ‘Repent, heretic, you may yet save your soul.’ Tanichus was shaking now, his face pale. Sweat shone from his skin. She’d seen this a hundred times in the suddenly caught-out-and-penitent – the guilt, the fear. And they were exactly the admission she was looking for. ‘Tell me the truth,’ she snarled at him. ‘What deal did you do?’ He was snivelling now, terrified. Words spilled out of him. ‘When I came here,’ he said, ‘the townspeople told me about the orks. The tribe had been destroying the villages, committing such horrors… and they were going to wipe out the town. The people told the orks about the cathedral. Said they could have anything they could find if they just left the town alone. Then I came, and they begged me for my help. They knew that the orks would come back. Knew what would happen to them.’ He seemed almost in tears. ‘They’re just people, Sister, just families. They have lives and fears and hopes. Children growing up.’ His face was etched in pain. ‘I just wanted to help them.’ He held back a sob. Augusta saw the pity on Viola’s freckled face, saw the stances of the others shift – they knew full well what the orks would have done to the towns-people. He said, ‘I went to find the orks. I told them that I would bring them weapons, armour, if they just left the people alone. And–’ ‘And so you brought them us.’ Augusta’s tone was scathing. ‘You beat them, didn’t you?’ He was pleading with her. ‘You won!’ She contemplated the sobbing man, water tracing clean lines through the filth on his skin, and she understood his pain, the choice he’d made. But it didn’t change the facts. ‘Lysimachus Tanichus, you are a traitor. You have manipulated the Adepta Sororitas to your own ends. You have betrayed the Ecclesiarchy, and the name of the Emperor.’ Tanichus opened his mouth, but she didn’t want to hear it. ‘And your story misses one critical point – what would have happened if we’d lost?’ ‘You’re Sister Superior Augusta Santorus – you don’t lose!’ ‘Tell that to Kimura.’ Tanichus glanced at the fallen Sister, then slumped forwards, defeated. He was sniffling. ‘I only wanted to help the people.’ ‘You betrayed us to the enemy.’ She backhanded him, her metal gauntlet cutting his cheek. His head snapped sideways, then he looked back up at her, uncomprehending and horrified. ‘You brought us here on a lie. You cost the life of Sister Kimura. You tried to flee the battle. Your guilt is manifest, and your life is forfeit.’ He stared at her, his mouth open. But she wasn’t done. ‘However, I will say this – this world, Lautis, in the Drusus Marches of the Calixis Sector, is now under the observation and protection of the Order of the Bloody Rose. We claim this cathedral, and all within it, in His name. And we will protect the people – on the assumption that they acknowledge the Emperor of All Mankind.’ Tanichus had fallen forwards. He was shaking, his hands over his face. ‘Please! I knew you’d beat them! I knew!’ ‘I will deliver your protection, Tanichus. But you…’ She dragged his head up again. ‘In pythonissam non patieris vivere – I shall not suffer your life.’ ‘Sister Superior…’ Viola’s voice came to her ears, not over the vox. ‘He should come back with us, face judgement–’ ‘Enough!’ Augusta snapped the order and Viola recoiled. ‘I know exactly what to do with this offal.’ ‘Sister,’ Jatoya said, more cautiously. ‘It is not our place–’ ‘He has mocked us!’ Augusta barked, furious. ‘Kimura is dead!’ Tanichus threw himself at her feet. ‘Please!’ Viola and Jatoya exchanged a glance. Augusta reached down with one hand, and dragged the sobbing man back to his feet. ‘You do not take the name of the saint in vain. You do not manipulate the Order to your own ends. And believe me, if the orks had won, both you and your town would still have been destroyed. That warboss would have cut you to pieces and eaten you.’ Tanichus was shaking now. She tore the rosarius out of his grasp, gave it to the closest of her Sisters. Then she pulled her fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour, and slit Tanichus’ throat. Augusta felt Viola flinch, though she said nothing. Tanichus gaped and fell, bubbles on his lips, hands to his throat, his blood mingling with that of the dead ork. His last word, as he hit the floor, was Mercy.",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE The things were still out there. On the altar steps, Sister Felicity stood waiting for them. Her red armour was stained with gore, her black-and-white cloak in tatters. At one hip rested her now-empty bolter, at the other, her silent chainsword. A small, upright figure in the heart of the broken cathedral, Felicity stood alone. Before her, scattered about the cathedral nave, the tech-priest’s servitors lay dead, their haphazard defence overwhelmed, their repairs all brought to an unready end. Jencir had commanded them to protect, and they had done so with utter brutality, hurling rubble and using their mechanised limbs to horrific effect – yet the incoming numbers had just been too many. Overcome by the rising tide, they had fallen as they had fought – mindless to the last. In a ruined state, around the base of the steps, lay the five Sisters of Felicity’s squad, their last stand thrown down. They too had fallen fighting, blade and bolter, fist and faith, savage to the last woman. In her head, she bade them farewell: blessed be their memories. She would not be able to give them their Last Rites, but they had perished with courage, and they stood now at the hand of the Emperor. With them lay the tech-priest Jencir, his back ripped open as he’d tried to flee – not an act of cowardice, but a failed attempt to reach the exterior vox-transmitters. And finally, slumped against the ruined wall, the missionary Lyconides was too broken to stand, his last breaths now rasping bloody, his lasrifle still gripped in his hand. His other hand was in his lap, as if trying to stuff his steaming bowels back into his belly. She respected the man’s courage – he was no soldier, but he’d given his best. As Felicity listened, his final prayer drifted like a ghost across the emptiness, and was gone. ‘Requiescet in lumine suo,’ she whispered softly. Rest in His light. The missionary toppled over sideways and lay still. Down in the nave, the things yammered. They were coming closer now, skulking and sneaking – she could hear their claws scraping on the ancient stone. They were circling round to her sides, lurking in the hot, ruined darkness of transept and cloister. She could feel them pacing, feel their presence like a crawl of sweat across her skin. She didn’t know if they were taunting her, waiting to see if she would falter, or if they were simply awaiting commands – but she knew that there were dozens of them. Hundreds. She drew the chainsword. If she stood fast against the beasts’ onslaught, she thought, she may yet get a strike at their master… Before she died. Slowly, Felicity walked up the final steps. She looked back at the fallen Jencir, his eye-clusters and mechadendrites hanging damaged and broken, his red Mechanicus cloak spread about him like a pool of blood. She reached the high altar, and stopped before the final step. Above her, the great window was missing, fallen from its stone frame thousands of years before; the new electro-candles, bought as a promise of reconsecration, burned with a tiny and defiant light. Despite the creatures behind her, she took a moment to bend one knee, her free hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour. ‘A morte perpetua. Domine, libra nos.’ And then she stood up. And turned around. The Sisters had not known. Felicity’s directive had come from Ophelia VII, direct from the canoness of her Order, Ianthe herself – and she and her squad had been sent all the way across the segmentum to this tiny world, this sweat of overgrowth and jungle. The previous deployment of Sisters had declared the location secure – they’d driven back the marauding orks, and had cleared the area enough to allow the tech-priest in. Felicity had come as security, and – more importantly – to ensure that the cathedral stayed within the ownership of the Order of the Bloody Rose, and of the Convent Sanctorum. An icon of Saint Mina, or so it was rumoured, still lay within this building – and her Order were not about to relinquish it. But their restoration had been interrupted. Jencir had raised the alarm – his deployed servitors, seeking to understand the extent of the repair, had ventured into the crypts. They’d detected movement, and the Sisters had gone down on reconnaissance. The first encounter had been small, and easily defeated. But they’d had no time. Even as they’d regrouped, taken a tactical defence position at the head of the crypt’s steps, more of the creatures had come. And then more. A welter of horrors, surging up from the depths. The servitors had been overcome in moments; the incoming beasts had seethed like nightmares, like a surge of teeth and blood. Outnumbered, surrounded, the Sisters had been cut off from their makeshift, modular habitations, and from any hope of off-planet communication. They’d done the only thing they could – they’d fought back. They’d retreated, defended the altar with every prayer, with every breath, with every last expended round… and they’d sung with the fury of it, their voices raised to the cathedral’s roofless, ruinous silence. But the things had just kept coming, mindless and slavering, attacking from every angle. Krak grenades had slain hundreds of them, brought walls down in cascading rumbles of broken stone; the creatures hadn’t cared. Felicity had seen her squad fight and fall, one after another, had watched the things dismember them, watched the creatures drag her Sisters’ limbs away in their teeth and worry at them, gnawing on them like old bones. They’d scattered the women’s remains in some deliberate pattern, some vile act of blasphemous worship. It was too hot in here, close and suffocatingly still. Under her blood-scarlet armour, sweat slid down her spine. Her gauntlet tightened on the hilt of her still-silent chainsword. Noli timere, she told them silently. I do not fear you. Felicity did not know why she still stood while the others had all perished, but she suspected that the things had some greater purpose for her, more than just their thirst for her life. Calmly, she recited the hymnal. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ And the creatures heard. They were creeping into view, now, letting her see them. They came down the aisle, and around the bases of the headless pillars; they rose up over the rubble like the slow advance of some thick, red tide. They came patiently this time, almost as if they savoured it; they came sniffing and snarling and licking, their long teeth bared and their spiked shoulders slinking low. They were taunting her, and she knew it. She raised her blade. She wanted to go down there, punish them for the deaths of her Sisters; she wanted to hack them to gobbets, pick them up and throw them against the walls, slam them into the cracked and weed-grown floor until they howled in pain and their bones broke and shattered– But she was the Emperor’s Daughter and her thoughts were clear. She stood where she was, His light at her back. The things came on, closer, closer. Their eyes were sharp as fangs, yellow and glinting. They reached the foot of the altar steps, and more and more came in behind them until the whole floor of the cathedral was alive, a writhing mass of red and glistening bodies. With a rasping snarl, she started the chainsword. The sudden roar echoed through the building, and the things leapt forwards as if goaded. They bounded up the steps, baying with impatience, jumping for her throat. ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ Die, blasphemer! She cut the first two clean in half, caught another on the backswing and sent it flying, its ribs half pulled from its body. Blood slicked her already red armour. They were all round her in moments, worrying at her cloak, their teeth and claws scraping over ceramite and plasteel. She kicked with her boots, hitting skulls and spines; the things snarled and yelped. Her free hand grabbed a leaping creature; she snapped its neck with a jerk of her wrist and threw it aside. The chainsword rasped its way through more. Her blood and voice sang. But still, they just kept coming. The cathedral was full of them, the whole floor rippling with spike-shouldered motion. They surged round her to get at Lyconides, and at the remains of the tech-priest. They threw themselves at her bodily, one after another, trying to knock her from her feet. She fought them off with knees and elbows and head-butts; she sawed into their red flesh, she kicked and stamped at them. Her free hand grabbed them by their collars and tossed them aside. But they had no regard for their own lives; they were driven by a bloodlust that burned from their skin. Ten more died, exploding into mist and gore. Twenty. Twenty-five. They just kept coming. Piles of crippled creatures grew around her, slowing their advance. One sank its teeth into her vambrace and hung from her forearm, the weight dragging at her shoulder. But she was still fighting, still singing the words of the hymnal, still defiant and exultant, still burning with her faith that was every bit as powerful as their craving for blood– They stopped. She staggered, suddenly bereft of resistance. The one on her arm hung limp; she had no recollection of having struck it. She sawed it off at the neck, watching the body detonate before it hit the floor. Recoiling almost reluctantly, the things shrank away. They growled at her, baring gore-smeared, yellow teeth. Coiling like curs, they slunk to the bottom of the steps and then stayed there, snapping at each other and pacing, restless. They watched her as they did so, their eyes burning. Felicity felt a rush of pure zeal; the Emperor was with her. She was still alive, still on her feet, still fighting. Her armour was scarred but intact. And she was still singing, her voice loud in the vox though there was no one left to hear it. But her discipline was strong – this was not victory, not yet. Those hounds were not beaten, they were waiting for something. She’d proven that she could best them, and they’d been called off… By something bigger. By something that wanted to face her itself. Not victory – but perhaps the single highest purpose of her life. Felicity was a Sister Superior of the Order of the Bloody Rose, here to reclaim this cathedral in the name of Saint Mina, and of the God-Emperor Himself. She had failed. Nevertheless, her final task was clear. Her bloody chainsword in one hand, she laid the other on the very last of her krak grenades. Whatever this warp-spawned horror may be, it did not daunt her. And she would take it down as she offered her life to the Emperor. Defended by the high walls of the Convent Sanctorum, Sister Superior Augusta wore her padded scarlet under­armour and a chasuble of black and white. Her steel-grey bob of hair fell forwards over her face as she bowed her head. Murmuring the Litany of Cleansing, she knelt upon the cold stone floor of her chamber, and she cleared her mind, her soul and her heart. Augusta was a warrior, a Daughter of the Emperor and the fighting fist of His Imperial Creed – but these ritual moments were just as sacred as the bloodshed and the battlefield. On the floor before her, laid out on its familiar red cloth, was her Sabbat-pattern ceramite armour, each piece positioned correctly, as illustrated in The Accords of ­Deacis VI. Her chainsword, stilled and silent, lay down one edge; her bolter, stripped and cleaned, on the other. The arrangement was as much a part of her as her litanies and the fleur-de-lys tattoo upon her cheek. Coloured light tumbled from her tiny, narrow window, catching the scarlet curve of her helmet and making it shine. It was dawn, and this was Lauds, and the ritual that came with each morning. She recited, ‘Et promissa – daturum adversus vires hostium Arma omnium qui oderunt nos.’ He promised that He would grant us strength to face our enemies, the weapons of all who hate us. As she intoned the words, she picked up the armour, piece by piece. She checked its fastenings, its purity seals, its strength and integrity; she studied it for damage, for cracks and dents, for uncleaned bloodstains. A Sister’s wargear was her second skin – one of the first battle-lessons Augusta had ever learned. ‘Every Sister walks with the Emperor,’ her tutor had told her, many years before. ‘But she must also depend on three things – her armour, her weapons, and her Sisters that surround her’. It was a lesson that Augusta had never forgotten. Continuing her recitation, she picked up her vambrace to check its inbuilt chrono-compass, her pauldrons, and then her breastplate to examine its semi-hidden fleur-de-lys blade. Then she laid the last piece back upon the cloth and sat back on her heels, head bowed. A familiar, armoured footstep sounded at the chamber doorway. Without turning, Augusta knew who it was, standing in the outer cloister and waiting for her to finish her morning devotions. ‘Sister Superior,’ said Sister Jatoya respectfully, as Augusta raised her head. ‘I did not wish to interrupt.’ In one smooth move, Augusta came to her feet and turned around. Her second-in-command stood waiting in the cloisters’ biolume, her head bare, her helm upturned under her arm. Her dark skin gleamed, but there was expectation in her stance – she was here with a request. Or an order. ‘You’re early,’ Augusta said. ‘Do you not have a class this morning?’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. ‘Teaching the schola’s novices the finer tricks of open-handed combat.’ She gave a faint smile, and the light from the window lit her face with the reflection of the Saint, and with the deep colours of the Bloody Rose. ‘But Canoness Ianthe has requested our presence, Sister. When our devotions are done, we’re to report to the Order chapel.’ A rush flickered through Augusta’s skin. ‘Do you know why?’ ‘No.’ Jatoya shook her head. ‘I’m not privy to such knowledge, and the servitor was little help.’ The smile spread, then faded. ‘But for the summons to come before the morning begins…’ Jatoya let the implication speak for itself. A personal summons from Canon­ess Ianthe was rare – in twenty years, half of them as the Sister Superior of her squad, Augusta had responded to maybe a dozen… and every one of them a call to war. The rush grew stronger, but it was instinctive, recognisable. It was the touch of her faith, that so-familiar flare of passion and hope. She looked up at the Saint in the window, at the holy light that haloed her stern, sword-bearing form, and gave a moment of thanks. Jatoya said softly, her tone amused, ‘I feel the nature of our devotions is about to change, Sister.’ It wasn’t Jatoya’s place to speculate – but the two women had known each other for more than a decade. They’d stood side by side against the orks on Lautis, the aeldari at Mis’bah, the tyranid invasion at the war-ravaged cities of Yulzond Cross. The trust between them was battle-honed, and strong. ‘You may be right.’ Augusta began to pick up her armour, donning it piece-by-piece – breast- and back-plate, cuisses, greaves. She closed her gorget around her throat, slung her blade at her hip, picked up her bolter and snicked the sight and magazine back into place. Then she opened the breech, sighted briefly down the barrel, and closed it again. ‘Very well,’ she said, holstering the bolter and picking up her helmet. ‘It would hardly do to keep the canoness waiting.’ They walked through the cloisters together, the huge drop of the convent’s outer walls to one side, the black rise of the Hallowed Spire to the other. The great, stained-glassaic windows ran with rain, and the blur of starships – the war vessels of the Imperium, the cargo and transport ships of the Ecclesiarchy – moved across them like shadows. The Chapel of Saint Mina was a later addition to the Convent Sanctorum, built by Deacis VI some two and a half thousand years after the ascension of Sebastian Thor. The Order of the Bloody Rose was young, but as warlike as its Saint had been, and no less militant. Walking past the votive candles and the floating cherubim, past the statues of the Saints and the engraved prayers, Augusta murmured the Litany of Mettle like a reflex, words of hope and strength. Beside her, Jatoya echoed each line. Age and faith surrounded them. Since the days of Thor himself, the Sisters of Battle had carried the flame of their devotion to all corners of the galaxy, had waged a ceaseless war against the Emperor’s foes – every witch, every mutant, every heretic, every xenos, every trace of Chaos wherever it could be found. As if eager, Augusta’s sword rattled against her thigh. She placed her hand on the pommel. Her squad been cooling their heels in the convent for almost a month – studying, practising, teaching the arts of war to their less experienced Sisters. It was rare for a veteran of Augusta’s rank to be at rest for this long, and peace was not in her nature. She missed praising the Emperor with bolter and blade. From the convent, voices began the morning hymnal, the verses immediately lifting into crystal-pure, four-part harmony. Gooseflesh prickled down Augusta’s arms. Jatoya said softly, ‘I will be glad if this hiatus is at an end. By Dominica’s eyes, if I have to spend another evening playing Tall Card…’ ‘Only because Sister Caia always wins.’ Augusta chuckled, but briefly. ‘But beware, Sister Militant. You may say those words to me, but in the presence of the canoness, you will show the proper respect.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya agreed. ‘I understand.’ She was nervous, Augusta realised – curious, as Jatoya had never once shown fear in the face of an enemy. ‘But…’ Jatoya made a final comment as they neared the chapel doors. ‘Tell me you don’t long for a new mission.’ They knew each other too well, and Augusta did not need to speak her answer aloud.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO The heavy doors creaked, loud as a declaration, and the servitor clicked as it checked and reported their presence. Ignoring it, Augusta paused in the open doorway, a draught stealing over her armour. The chapel seemed empty. It rose before the Sisters in a long hollow of pale grey, pillared and chill. Twin lines of banners, red and black and white, depicted the fleur-de-lys and the Bloody Rose of their Order. At its far end, flooding its emptiness with light, the great window portrayed the Emperor Himself, His gauntleted hands gripping the hilt of a huge, upturned blade. Sol rose behind Him, haloing Him in wonder, and the star’s bright yellow illumination slanted all the way down through the nave, and warmed the walk to His feet. Electro-candles burned upon the altar, outshone by His light. In two decades of service, Augusta still could not enter this building without a catch in her throat. She lowered her gaze and murmured a prayer. She heard Jatoya again echo her words. ‘Sister Superior, Sister Militant.’ One of Ianthe’s novitiates, robed in grey and her blonde head down, had appeared soundlessly beside them. The girl was flanked by two more servitors, each of whom carried a wide brass tray. Observing the proper respect, both women relinquished their helmets, then unclipped their bolters and laid them aside. More slowly, Augusta drew her blade and placed it, too, within the servitors’ care. She felt bereft without her weapons, but you did not enter the chapel bearing arms. The servitors retreated. ‘In the name of Saint Mina and the Golden Throne,’ Augusta said. ‘We are the willing daughters of the God-Emperor. We come at His command, and to do His bidding.’ ‘The canoness is waiting for you, Sisters,’ the novitiate said. ‘Come.’ She beckoned, and the two women followed her up towards the chancel. They passed beneath the organ’s lofty hollow, the tall lines of brass pipes that rose glittering towards the vaulted roof. They passed beneath the armoured statue of Saint Mina herself, her sword at her hip. From the window, Sol’s yellow illumination brought a touch of gentleness to her austere features. They came to the foot of the altar steps. Here, both women dropped to one knee and traced out the lines of the fleur-de-lys on their armour. Then they rose back to their feet and stood smoothly at ease, feet apart, hands behind their backs, their chins lifted and their heads bared to the light. At the foot of the pulpit, Canoness Ianthe was waiting for them. ‘Your eminence,’ Augusta said. ‘You wished our presence.’ The canoness said nothing. Tall and pale and bone-lean, her chill gaze raked both women head to foot. ‘I did,’ she said, when her examination was complete. Neither Sister reacted. Ianthe was a stern disciplinarian who kept her Order under tight control – and they both knew when not to speak. She snapped a command, and both women stamped to attention, hands to their sides, feet together. She nodded at their efficiency. Her steps quiet, she stopped before them, hair ice-white, her face lined and her tattoo faded to blue with her age. She inspected their wargear as if they stood upon a parade ground, her gaze pausing on the multiple beads on Augusta’s chaplet – her many medals of merit. Augusta had faced foes across every segmentum of the galaxy, and had never once flinched from the fight. Both women continued to stare at the steps. ‘At ease,’ Ianthe said at last. With a simultaneous stamp, they returned to their original stance. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ words seemed like an announcement. ‘Sister Militant.’ She paced before them, her rigidity uncompromised. ‘I understand that you are both becoming…’ she spun on her heel, ‘… restless… with your studies.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta answered honestly, though her gaze didn’t waver. ‘We miss the hymns of the battlefield.’ ‘I have some sympathy with your agitation, Sisters.’ Ianthe spun back again, and nodded at them, her face almost smiling. ‘These walls are holy and no foe would dare assail them. Yet it is a Sister’s place to hunt and slay the foes of the Light, wherever they may be found.’ She stopped, eyeing Jatoya, the moment of amusement gone. ‘But I take it that you comprehend your hiatus?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta said. ‘We have a new Sister in our squad, replacing Sister Kimura. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘Blessed be her memory.’ The litany was returned, and all three women observed a moment’s quiet. Ianthe said, ‘Certainly, you must be familiar with your new recruit.’ Something in her voice seemed to hint that Augusta had missed the point, but she went on, ‘You must trust her with your lives, know that you can rely upon her, know that she will praise the Emperor fearlessly, with battle, blade and bolter, just as you do.’ She spun, paced again. ‘You need to know her as well as you know all your squad.’ ‘Yes, milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Akemi is young but wise. Her skills are extensive. And this hiatus has enabled her, and us, to learn a great deal about each other.’ ‘You say “wise”, not “strong”.’ Ianthe paused, looking from one face to the other. ‘Do you consider her battle-ready, Sister Superior?’ Augusta knew her canoness well enough to realise that the question was a test in itself – an examination of her expertise, and of her knowledge of her squad. If she answered ‘yes’ simply to secure a new mission and to bring their hiatus to an end then she was not worthy of her command. But Augusta had long experience – she had been tested before and would be tested again. She answered, evenly, ‘I judge her battle-ready, milady. She shows both strength and insight. Sometimes the latter can be a strength of its own.’ ‘Just so,’ Ianthe agreed. ‘And you, Sister Militant?’ Jatoya answered, ‘I, too, would trust her with my life. She is a worthy addition to the squad.’ ‘Good.’ Ianthe said, nodding again. She resumed her pacing. Despite the location, the canoness wore her armour like a confrontation, like some constant challenge – and her own numerous merits told tales of that challenge fulfilled. Ianthe was a formidable warrior, and not one of her Order would question her. ‘Then, Sisters,’ she said, ‘I have some news for you – perhaps news you will even welcome.’ She spun on her heel and paused in front of them. ‘Your hiatus has reached its end. I have a mission for you that may test even your…’ she glanced at Augusta, ‘…considerable mettle.’ The last words were faintly edged; they carried implications that Augusta didn’t quite follow. ‘Milady?’ The canoness gave a faint, humourless smile, and continued her pacing, making them wait. At last she said, ‘How well do you remember Sister Superior Felicity Albani?’ Felicity! The name was like a shock – sudden and unexpected. Augusta knew Felicity, had known her for years. She remembered the woman from the schola, small and dark and determined, and one of the single finest swordswomen that the Order had ever seen. Carefully, she said, ‘I know Sister Felicity well, milady. We studied together.’ She paused, catching up with the implications, and then said, ‘And she commanded the squad–’ ‘That took your place. Upon Lautis.’ All signs of levity gone, Ianthe turned to face them and stopped dead, her hands behind her back. Her tone was cold, now. The light from the window made her red shoulders gleam. Caught, uncomprehending, Augusta could only stare straight ahead and say, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘The world,’ the canoness continued, ‘which you and your squad had reported secure.’ The word was an outright accusation. Augusta felt Jatoya almost flinch, but both Sisters held themselves still. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe came forwards, glared into Augusta’s face. She went on, ‘In your final report, you declared that the ork tribes upon Lautis had been slain or broken, and that the area was secure enough for the Adeptus Mechanicus to begin their analysis – and repair – of the discovered cathedral. Do you recall this report, Sister Superior?’ Still staring straight ahead, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness continued to glare. ‘You slew the ork warlord?’ ‘Not I, milady,’ Augusta told her. ‘The warlord was slain by Sister Viola Taenaris.’ ‘But the warlord was slain by your squad?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘And with the beast dead,’ Ianthe said, ‘you considered the task completed, did you not?’ ‘No, milady,’ Augusta said. Her voice was level, betraying nothing. Yet the light from the window seemed too bright; she could not have raised her gaze to Him even if she’d been permitted. Instead, she offered the contents of her report. ‘After the death of the warlord, we remained upon Lautis for fifty-seven days. We sought, and discovered, the landing point and the established base of the Crossed Axe ork tribe. Without strong leadership, we found them ­scattered and easy to defeat–’ ‘That was not the question, Sister.’ With an inhalation like annoyance, Ianthe resumed her pacing. Her shadow moved across the floor like an accusation. ‘I’m asking you whether the area was, indeed, secure.’ ‘To my knowledge, milady,’ Augusta said, ‘the area was secure.’ Ianthe continued to watch them, narrow-eyed and gauging. Above, the cherubim circled as if they were recording every word, preserving the data for the Order’s records. An error, never to be forgotten. The canoness said, ‘As of Compline yesterday, we failed to receive Sister Felicity’s regular report – and all our subsequent attempts to reach her have found only static. It has been seven days since any communications have come to us from Lautis. Attempts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to reach Jencir have been likewise unsuccessful.’ Prevented by stern discipline from doing anything else, Augusta waited for the canoness to keep speaking. ‘I need,’ Ianthe said, ‘your assurance that your reconnaissance was thorough. That there was no ork, or xenos, or taint of Chaos, remaining upon Lautis when Sister Felicity was despatched to take your place.’ The lash of her anger was strong, now. ‘Because if I discover that you were in error, Sisters, I will see you both among the Repentia.’ She had stopped again, her red shoulders seeming to fill the grey space of the chancel. ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘I gave the order, milady.’ Augusta said. Her mind recalled the cathedral ruins upon Lautis, the battle with the orks, the sweaty heat of the jungle-marsh and the poverty of the townspeople. ‘Sister Jatoya is blamele–’ ‘Silence.’ The word was not loud, but it brought Augusta to an immediate halt. The canoness flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. She said, ‘I understand that you do not always insist upon your squad’s… strictest discipline, Sister Superior. Am I correct?’ ‘Milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Upon the battlefield, our discipline and unity are without question. And, as it was my decision to execute the missionary Tanichus for his deception of the Adepta Sororitas, so it was my decision to declare the Lautis cathedral secure. Sister Jatoya is blameless in this.’ The canoness said nothing; she seemed to be considering. Above them, the Emperor watched, seeing all. ‘Very well,’ Ianthe said, at last. She gestured at the novitiate, who scurried for the doors. The girl’s place was taken by one of the servitors, who offered the canoness a data-slate. ‘Stand easy,’ she said, allowing both women to relax. She scrolled through the data, then said, ‘Sisters, your service records are flawless, both of you. You’ve served Throne and Emperor with courage and faith for more than thirty years between you, and I’ve seen you both grow from girlhood into warriors of whom I am extremely proud. But this…’ she brandished the slate, its surface glittering, ‘…this is Sister Felicity’s final report. She states that their base had been established, their perimeter defences set up. She states that the missionary Lyconides had made beneficial contact with the local town, and that the reconstructive assessment of the cathedral was commencing on schedule. The Adeptus Mechanicus have released information which corroborates this, and they add that the tech-priest’s servitors had commenced the initial works.’ Ianthe looked up, her expression cold. A warrior to her core, Augusta had little patience for politics, but she had learned at the schola that there was a strong and long-term bond between the followers of Saint Mina and the Adeptus Mechanicus. ‘Something has happened to them, Sister Superior,’ the canoness said. ‘Whether an electromagnetic storm has damaged the transmitters, or whether an unseen foe has arisen, we do not know.’ Jatoya said, ‘Permission to speak, milady.’ ‘Granted.’ ‘Is there still a ship in orbit?’ ‘There is not,’ Ianthe said. ‘The Tukril, the ship of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and its escort, the Imperial warship Kyrus, have already returned to Mars, carrying requests for Jencir’s additional supplies. They’re not due back into Lautis’ orbit for another eighty-two days.’ ‘And you want us to go with them.’ Augusta spoke the understanding aloud. ‘Milady.’ Ianthe smiled at her, her expression cold. ‘No, Sister Superior, I do not.’ The words were final, icy. ‘The Adeptus Mechanicus cannot risk more resources on a world so bereft of either wealth or merit – not until their security is assured.’ Her tone was razor sharp. ‘Sisters, you will secure the area. And, this time, without a mistake.’ Augusta still stared straight ahead, though she felt the Emperor’s Light above her, His gaze that saw all. The implication was clear: if something had happened to Felicity’s squad, then she, Augusta, was responsible – by accident, by omission, by inadequate information – and the standing of her entire Order had suffered because of it. Her squad were being sent to Lautis not because of their experience or their efficiency but to rectify that error, and to cleanse the name of the Order of the Bloody Rose. She felt Jatoya flick her a tiny, sideways glance, and realised that her second-in-command had understood the same thing. ‘Of course, milady,’ Augusta said, raising her chin. ‘This is my responsibility, and I will take it willingly upon my shoulders.’ ‘I’m glad you see this my way, Sisters,’ Ianthe commented dryly. ‘Very well then. Muster your squad, Augusta. Report to the docking bay for Matins tomorrow morning.’ She held up the data-slate. ‘And may I suggest you take the intervening time to study Felicity’s report and the information offered by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Memorise the maps, Sisters. You will be needing them.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ The Sisters responded together, watching the servitors with their brass trays as they whirred down towards the doorway. ‘Very well then,’ Ianthe said. ‘You are dismissed.’ Both Sisters came back to attention, stamped a smart about-turn and marched back down the aisle. Above them, the floating cherubim watched them go, their cold, augmetic gazes recording every step. ‘Lautis?’ Sister Viola’s freckled face showed pure surprise. ‘Again?’ The squad were gathered round a small table in the refectorium, a votive candle flickering at its centre to which to offer Grace. Augusta had called them for a briefing before they attended midday prayers and then went back to their respective classes. ‘Be mindful, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘This is not just a reconnaissance mission. The honour of our Order is in jeopardy.’ Viola grinned. ‘But – we get to kill more greenskins?’ Augusta checked a sigh. The squad’s best shot, and field-promoted to the use of its thrice-blessed heavy bolter, Viola had returned from Lautis with a foolhardy streak that verged on overconfidence. She had never questioned her orders, nor taken an uncalled-for initiative, but sometimes Augusta wondered if she had been entirely ready for the advancement. ‘Lautis is at the outermost edge of the segmentum,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘We may find bigger things than orks.’ Viola’s hand strayed to her hip, and found her empty holster. Unlike the bolters of her Sisters, her own weapon was too bulky – and too sacred – to be casually carried. She rattled her fingertips in annoyance. Caia and Melia, one pale and with hair like bronze, the other dusky-skinned and dark-eyed, exchanged a glance. As close as blood-kin, they had come up through the schola together and had fought under Augusta’s command for almost as long as Jatoya. ‘May I say something, Sister?’ The squad’s newest member, Sister Akemi, still spoke with a slight hesitation, her novitiate habits hard to leave behind. ‘Of course.’ ‘I’ve spent many years studying.’ Her eyes darted from face to face with a faint nervousness. ‘And I know that Lautis has little resource. Explorations onto its moon have found promethium deposits, but nothing worth the expense of mining. As a world, it has little or no value–’ ‘It has the kynx and lho-leaf that brought the orks in the first place,’ Melia commented. Caia chuckled. Augusta was not amused. ‘All the more reason to be wary,’ she said. ‘If something does dwell upon Lautis – and that something has faced or defeated Felicity Albani – then we will need to be on our guard.’ Her gaze travelled sternly round her squad. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Melia said. ‘I fear this rest-interval has made me cranky.’ ‘That will be rectified soon enough,’ Augusta told her, with a hint of amusement. She pushed back her chair with a loud scrape and stood up. ‘Pre-dawn muster, Sisters, at Matins, at the landing pad. And in full wargear. I will speak to the quartermaster and requisition our off-world equipment.’ She glanced up at the refectory window. ‘May we walk with the Emperor and carry His light into the very darkest reaches of the galaxy.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE The shuttle’s cargo bay was cold. Strapped into her seat, her back to the cold metal wall, Augusta cast an eye over their requisitioned gear – Phaeton-pattern reinforcement kits, field generators, new vox-antennae, everything they would need to secure the basecamp. They were thirty-seven days out of Ophelia VII, and this trip down to Lautis’ surface was the very last leg of the journey. She spoke into the internal vox. ‘Shipmaster, how long?’ The commander of the Imperial vessel Sorex, now in parked orbit about the planet, had insisted upon piloting the shuttle personally – perhaps to ensure that the Sisters were delivered safely, and that he’d discharged his responsibility without mishap. His voice came back to them. ‘Two minutes ‘til we drop below the cloudline, Sister. Twenty-three to the landing point.’ The shuttle’s interior screen showed a continuous, passing rush of grey, soupy cloud. ‘Current data shows climate conditions at sixty-eight per cent humidity, atmospheric temperature at twenty-nine-point-five degrees. It’s a swamp down there.’ Caia muttered, ‘We know.’ ‘Any communications?’ Augusta said. ‘We’re just getting static. Full surface scan commencing as soon as we hit optimum range.’ Jatoya asked, ‘Signs of hostility?’ ‘Nothing that doesn’t belong,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Life signs are minimal and all fully indigenous. Just the local predators, Sisters, nothing you’re not expecting.’ The screen showed more clouds. ‘How long before we’re in visual range of the town?’ Augusta asked. ‘Fourteen minutes,’ he said. ‘Will keep you updated.’ ‘Thank you.’ Viola, her heavy bolter now rested across her lap, voiced a curse. ‘I’ll be glad when we’re off this blood boat.’ ‘Blood boat?’ Akemi asked her, puzzled. ‘What is a blood boat?’ The newest Sister had a little fetish that she toyed with constantly, a tiny, silver feather that she flicked endlessly between the fingers of her left hand. ‘Old Imperial slang,’ Augusta said. ‘It means a cargo ship that travels a very long way, usually to secure grox-meat or similar.’ Frowning, her small, pallid face ever-serious, Akemi nodded. Augusta could see her twisting the little feather and filing the information away, every last detail where it belonged. Akemi had a remarkable memory; she had almost taken her Oath to the Convent’s Order Dialogous, the Order of the Quill. Now, fielded for the first time as a sworn soldier and a member of the Bloody Rose, her tension was becoming apparent. Yet Augusta had no doubts about the young woman’s readiness. The Sister Superior had spent the five weeks of their interstellar journey running her squad through endless pattern-drills and live-fire training manoeuvres. They’d jogged round the gantries, morning and night, in full wargear; they’d practised skirmish exercises until they knew and could anticipate each other’s reactions. And they’d observed their rituals of daily prayer – Matins, Lauds, Vespers, Compline – in the Sorex’s tiny chapel. The screen showed a brief flash of Lautis’ bloated, orangish sun, and Akemi’s little fetish glinted in the light. As if suddenly aware of her habit, she slipped it back into the cuff of her vambrace, then leaned back against the wall. Augusta could see her lips moving as she prayed. Throughout their journey, the Navy crew had stayed well away from the Sisters – too intimidated or awed by their presence, or by the legends that accompanied them. Sometimes, greatly daring, they’d watched from the farthest walkways, and once, goaded by mocking colleagues, a young officer had called a lewd remark at Akemi’s armoured back. The shipmaster had slung the man in the brig and had reminded the crew that the Sisters were servants of the God-Emperor, and soldiers like themselves. They were not saints to be iconised – the thought was outright blasphemy – nor objects to be ogled. Once the young man had been released, Sister Akemi had spoken to him face-to-face. Augusta didn’t know what she had said, but the man had left with his skin ashen and his knees shaking. And so, Augusta had thought, do the legends perpetuate themselves. But still, it had allayed any flickering doubt: Akemi had courage. The Emperor had called her to be a warrior, and a warrior she would be. ‘Reaching optimum range now, Sisters,’ said the shipmaster. ‘Scan of township commencing.’ The clouds had thinned to wisps and were parting completely as the shuttle dropped below their cover. The screen began to show a dull, greenish atmosphere, heavy with rising steam and trapped heat. Augusta studied it carefully, remembering an identical scan from their initial reconnaissance trip, now almost a Solar year before. Her hand touched the fleur-de-lys on her breastplate. ‘Lautis.’ Caia, sat next to her, gave a faint groan. ‘Not somewhere I ever needed to see a second time.’ Melia said, ‘At least we know what to expect.’ ‘Do we?’ Caia answered her. Always the sharpest of the squad, Sister Caia missed little. ‘Do we really?’ Her words were met with silence as their import sank home. The shuttle slowed, descending further, and the passing seethe of jungle became more visible. There were the familiar festoons of creepers, and the marshy deceits of the underlying swamp. There was the dark, volcanic rock, jagged and pitted with holes. There was the rising outcry of the indigenous wildlife, the loud and colourful birds and the lurking monsters of the stagnant water. Eyeing the waiting mire, Augusta’s belly tightened with the descent. Like Caia, she had not expected to come back here. The area was secure, she reminded herself. We slew the warlord. We hunted down the scattered remnants of its tribe. We offered the town our protection. She wanted to try her vox, to try to reach Felicity on the Order’s private channel, but she was still out of range. Data flickered across the bottom of the pict-screen, showing the angle of the planet’s rotation, its climate and weather systems, its twenty-two hour day. She reminded herself of the information as she studied the passing rush of the native flora, and searched for the particular pattern that marked the town itself – the habitation closest to the ruined cathedral. ‘Threat level green,’ the shipmaster said. ‘You’re in the clear. Requested landmark becoming visible in three… two… one…’ There was a faint note of relief in his voice as he said, ‘And there we are, right on schedule. Final approach now. Praise the God-Emperor, Sisters, we’re safe and sound.’ Augusta undid her straps and stood up, her back stiff. With one hand on the shuttle’s roof to steady herself, she came forwards to scrutinise the screen. And there it was: the looming, crumbling mass of the cathedral’s ruin, and, slightly closer, the square, black shape that was the town’s ancient ziggurat, its icon, temple and government. Around it spread the familiar mosaic of dark, stone buildings and odd, right-angled roads. To one side, there was the brief, rippling flash of moving water. Her belly lurched again as the shuttle slowed further. That was the same town, the one they’d saved, the place for which Sister Kimura had given her life. They’d given Kimura her Last Rites in the ruined cathedral, but the townspeople had celebrated her memory and their own gratitude. They’d raised firebrands to the Emperor’s name, singing hymns of local tradition. Carved into the stepped sides of the great ziggurat, Augusta remembered, there were armoured warriors, their features blunted, their weapons and armour stylised, but recognisable – symbols left over from the Great Crusade. Lautis was older than the Order, older than the Sisters themselves. And yet the town’s priest – she remembered the woman clearly – had understood the Sisters’ faith and their love for their Emperor. She had pointed at the ziggurat’s carvings and talked about their local legends– ‘No life signs,’ the shipmaster said. What? The comment stopped Augusta dead. Uncomprehending, she studied the screen. Though they were still too far away, she found herself searching for movement, for some way to deny the man’s words. Behind her, her squad were suddenly tense. Viola’s hands tightened on the heavy bolter; Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, turning over and over. Surprise and concern shot from Sister to Sister along the inside of the cargo bay. Augusta said, her tone grim, ‘Scan again.’ ‘Aye.’ Side-rockets fired. The floor tilted as the vessel turned, and Augusta caught at a rivet-studded upright to keep her feet. After a moment, the shipmaster said, ‘Scan radius expanding. Two miles from grid one-niner-seven by three-forty-five.’ There was a longer pause, and he repeated, ‘No life signs, Sister. Nothing. Not even the predators.’ ‘But…’ Viola sounded as shocked as Augusta felt, ‘…there’s a whole town down there.’ Felicity’s final report had said nothing about the town being threatened, nor about any incoming force or foe. Augusta said, ‘That township’s home to over three thousand people.’ ‘Sister.’ The shipmaster’s voice held respect, and complete certainty. ‘There’s no one down there.’ ‘Can you get a signal?’ The others were standing up now, checking weapons and wargear. The first flickerings of combat-readiness were stealing through the inside of the shuttle. ‘No communications, Sister,’ he returned, his tone even. ‘Even this close, there’s no response from the basecamp. Will keep trying.’ ‘Rotate frequencies,’ Augusta said. ‘Try every Imperial channel.’ ‘Trying all Imperial and all known Mechanicus frequencies, Sister. There’s no response.’ Akemi dropped her fetish and leaned over to pick it up. In the faint, green light, her small face was etched with worry. Viola’s fingers traced the carvings and the purity seals on the Godwyn-pattern heavy bolter. Aware of their tension, Augusta still watched the screen. The absence of the townspeople was a significant shift in their mission parameters – and removed almost all possibility that Felicity’s silence had been caused by some errant storm. It also meant that the townspeople could offer them neither information nor supplies. The Arvus was slowing still further now, dropping below the canopy; it smashed through the jungle, dense and green. Brackish, noxious waters reflected the vehicle’s belly-lights, and the pitted, dark stone of the town’s outer walls grew closer. Akemi’s gaze flicked back and forth, reading the scrolling data. Melia’s hand touched her fleur-de-lys, while Caia fiddled with the sight on her bolter, clicking and unclicking it, again and again. In the metal walls of the shuttle, the noise was oddly loud. The shipmaster’s voice said, ‘Do you wish to return to the Sorex, Sisters?’ ‘We do not,’ Augusta said. ‘Our mission is very clear. Take us to the landing point, shipmaster, and drop the hatch. Once our gear is unloaded, I want you out of here. Upon your return to the Sorex, please upload what we have found so far. We do not know what waits for us, but I wish the canoness to be aware of the situation.’ She didn’t need to add: In case we cannot make that communication ourselves. ‘Yes, Sister,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Landing point ETA, two minutes.’ The screen became murkier as the vessel passed into the treeline. The cargo bay seemed suddenly very dark. Caia’s clicking stopped. In the faint, greenish light, Augusta looked at her squad. ‘Very well.’ She was alert now, her mind sharp and working – they were in the field, and this was no time for doubt or hesitation. ‘Listen to me. When that hatch comes down, Viola, out and on point. Caia, Melia, you’ll take back up. Jatoya, Akemi, with me – we’ll need to unload our gear and let this shuttle get back into the air. It’s vulnerable, and I need it safely away.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘And once we’re down, our first priority is to secure the basecamp. Jatoya, take Viola, Caia and Melia. Do a full sweep and establish the perimeter. Akemi, with me – I’ll need you to access the camp’s records.’ She glanced at the young woman, her black hair shining. ‘You read machine dialect, yes?’ ‘A little, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘My training was very basic.’ ‘Good enough. See if you can get into Jencir’s records as well as Felicity’s.’ Augusta’s smile was grim, humourless. ‘You never know what you might find.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘I’ll take the field emitters and the gun emplacements, make sure everything is rearmed and fully operational. And once we’re secure, we’re going into that town.’ She was still watching the scan, watching the rising blur of stone that was the ziggurat, now looming close. ‘From this point, Sisters, we assume that Felicity’s squad has passed into the Emperor’s blessing, that the area is hostile, and that this is a full combat mission.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ They saluted her, fists to chestplates. ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘And may His light be with us all.’ Akemi dropped her fetish back into her vambrace. She picked up her helm, dropped it over her head, and twisted the seal closed. ‘Approaching the landing point,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Dropping speed-flaps now. Thirty seconds.’ Augusta could feel the vessel lowering, slowing to a hover. Her ears popped, and she lifted her own helm and snapped it into place. She flicked off the safety on her bolter, checked its ammo for the fourth time, and laid her other hand on her chainsword. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The alarm on the rear hatch started to blare. The lock released with an audible clunk. Hydraulics whined. Like uncoiling ribbons, light and steam stole down into the cargo-bay. Viola was already on her feet, heavy bolter in both hands. To Augusta, she looked like she wanted to fight. The Arvus hovered, jet engines thundering. The air reeked of promethium fuel and shimmered with oily heat. Bright belly lights showed the landing area – an open surface of cracked, dark stone that bordered the town on one side. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Under the engines’ noise, the words of the Litany of Battle flowed, steadying them. Line and verse wove from one voice to the next over the vox – where one Sister paused, another would take up the words, and the prayer rolled through and around them all, reminding them that this was His work, that they were here in His name. Here, upon Lautis. Again. Perhaps, Augusta thought, they were hoping that Felicity would hear them. The shuttle door lowered more fully, and the thick mist of the jungle flooded the back of the vehicle. Looking out at the swamp, the Sister Superior felt a pang of unease. She came to the side of the ramp to see more clearly, and saw that the rock of the landing area was speckled with green. There was only a tiny amount, but gentle, curling fronds of jungle vegetation had crept between the slabs, up through the various cracks. Small, perhaps, but with enough time, they could shatter the rock asunder. Obsessive to a fault, no tech-priest would permit such carelessness – no one had been out here in weeks. The lowering hatch thunked to a stop. Viola was already moving, boots crashing down the ramp, heavy bolter to her shoulder. She jumped from the ramp’s edge, landing in a combat kneel and moving her weapon in steady arcs. The heat of jet and jungle would confuse the preysight in her helmet, but Viola had the vehicle at her back and a clear field of fire – if anything moved, she’d see it. Nothing moved. Caia and Melia followed at a low run, dropping from the edge of the ramp. They crouched to offer Viola cover as she dashed forwards again. The Sisters’ skirmish-deployment was perfect, a smoothly functioning combat-machine. Their voices came back over the vox, now together, united in a quiet, steady chant of the hymnal – not the harmonised rage of full-on warfare, but the calm, clear caution of routine scouting. The still-firing engines drowned other noises out. The Arvus dangled in place, three inches above the stone ground, waiting. ‘Jatoya!’ Shouting to make herself heard, the Sister Superior instructed Jatoya to take the position at the ramp’s foot, flamer covering the approach. Then she gestured for Akemi to give her a hand with the gear. One by one, the two women threw the heavy cases out of the back of the shuttle. Silently cursing the absence of loaders, Augusta kept her bolter and chainsword holstered, and gestured to the side of the landing area, where the walls of the township could be clearly seen. ‘Over there! Stack it by the watchpost!’ The cathedral, further back and on the other side of the town, had faded to a shadowy blur, drowned in the planet’s noxious mist and the colossal overgrowth of flora. ‘Viola! Advance and secure the basecamp area! Caia, Melia, with Viola. Jatoya, Akemi, with me! Let’s get out of here!’ Breathless from the heat, ducking the noise of the Arvus and its hot convection winds, the Sisters picked up their gear and ran for the camp. Once they were clear, the shuttle lifted to the top of the canopy, its lights bright. It hovered there a moment, almost as if it were waiting for something, then it turned, and was swallowed by the trees.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR Sister Akemi crouched at the corner of a dark and moss-grown wall, her heart pounding. The wall was basalt, and carved in lines and patterns that still glowed faintly, as if with a biolume all of their own. Five paces ahead of Akemi’s position, Sister Viola crouched with the heavy bolter covering the roadway. Her armour glistened scarlet with condensing mist. Behind Viola’s shoulder, Sister Caia had her bolt pistol in one hand, and her auspex in the other. ‘The shipmaster was right,’ Caia said, over the vox. ‘There’s nothing out here.’ Akemi had read the reports, and she knew what the Sisters had been expecting. There should have been people here – hunters, foragers, crafters, builders. There should have been farmers, and the strange, pot-bellied livestock they called ‘paru’. There should have been soldiers, coming to welcome them, or to warn them away. There should have been the local priest, the leader of her people. But there was nothing. With its eerie, patterned gleam stretching outwards into the swamp-mist, the entire town looked empty. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The words of the hymnal were warming, familiar. …Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Be sure.’ Augusta’s tone was calm. ‘I’m sure, Sister,’ Caia told her. ‘There’s nothing moving, not so much as a beetle.’ ‘Very well,’ the Sister Superior said. ‘We remain in skirmish formation and proceed into the town. Viola, on point. Caia, on scan. Be alert, we cannot miss anything.’ ‘Aye.’ Viola moved forwards five paces, then crouched, again, to cover the roadway. Behind them, they’d found the basecamp empty. Allaying some of the squad’s initial fears, the fusion reactor and chemical batteries had been untouched; the interior lumens had shown pods and corridors in all their reinforced plasteel glory. Akemi had not known what to expect, and she’d found it oddly severe, carving its place out of the jungle with electro-fences and gun-emplacements, all still fully operational. The field emitters had even kept the flora at bay. Jencir, Augusta had commented, had extended the original camp – enlarged the area to accommodate his servitors, and the equipment he would need. But Jencir had gone. The servitors had gone. Felicity and their Sisters had all gone. The tiny chapel had been deserted, the pods echoing empty. The food in the storage units had been rotting in the heat, the water purifier all congealed with a thick, local moss. Even the tech-priest’s little brass cogitator had been left all alone, standing in his workshop with its metal beginning to corrode. While the squad had moved to secure the area, Akemi had studied the thing, trying to understand Jencir’s precisely noted analysis. But even from the tech-priest, there had been nothing – the reconnaissance of the cathedral had commenced on schedule, and the parts of his records that she could read had been chemical compositions, structural assessments, and endless, endless lists. She had tried to read more, struggling with the mist-rotted printouts, and she’d listened to Augusta’s attempts to make contact over the vox, listened to the bristle of static that was her only answer. The basecamp had been deserted. And now, the town was exactly the same. What had happened to the people? From the scourge of the Kraken… Suddenly, the silence seemed huge, and full of waiting. Her flesh crawling, Akemi fine-tuned her preysight. She wanted to see down the misted streets; she scanned the doorways and the windows and the tops of the walls. Surely there must be people still here somewhere, out in the farmlands, or standing by the odd, obelisk-shaped fountains and collecting the water that flowed down their sides? But even the water was stilled now, choked by the moss. The mist seethed, mocking, and she shuddered. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta said, ‘Keep moving.’ ‘Aye.’ Following Viola and Caia, Akemi ran to the next point and crouched again. This time, she’d ducked down beside a square, open-fronted stone building. Outside, a stylised figure, familiar armour crudely depicted, stood with its arms outstretched. Against it leaned a dozen electro-spears, their points ­scattered with rust, and glinting with moisture. From behind Akemi, Melia breathed, ‘Where did those come from?’ ‘Jencir, I would think – or Lyconides. A gift for the town.’ Augusta picked one up and thumbed the switch. The weapon fizzled and died. She put it back against its stone support, and said, ‘But I do not understand why the weapons are abandoned. If the people have left, then why are these still here?’ ‘Cross the jungle unarmed?’ Jatoya commented, from the back of the line. ‘Unwise, even without the orks.’ ‘Perhaps they’re all dead,’ Viola commented. ‘Then where are the bodies?’ Caia’s answer was bleak. ‘I dislike this.’ Even the Sister Superior sounded tense. ‘I want every building checked, every road, every corner.’ There was something in her tone that made Akemi’s fear rise again – Augusta usually seemed so indomitable. ‘Whatever’s happened here, we need to know, and we need this location secure before we move on to the cathedral. I’m not leaving our backs open.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved on. The hymnal was a breath now, almost subvocal as the squad listened to the silence of the town. From the blasphemy of the fallen… Another zig-zag crossroads, another fountain. The ancient stone patterns gleamed in green, all blurred by the mist. But nowhere was there movement. Not a bird cawed as it fled their advance; not a beetle scuttled as it escaped their boots. Even the surrounding jungle was utterly silent, as if the festooned loom of the trees was as bereft of life as everything else. Despite the environmental protections of her armour, Akemi was beginning to perspire. She had a sense of darkness and pressure, of rising claustrophobia; she felt like her helm had been broached, somehow, like she was inhaling the sweltering closeness of the atmosphere, the tightness of the sweat-thick air. …Our Emperor, deliver us. But none of the internal breach-warnings had been triggered, and sternly she told herself to breathe more deeply. Slowly, the moss grew thicker. It clustered in the corners of the walls and blotched the roadway like an infection. Desolation stretched out around them, endless and soundless. Side-road after side-road showed nothing – only the patterned lines in the dark stone. From the begetting of daemons… They crept onwards, even more slowly now, watching in every direction. The hymnal faded to almost a thrum, a steady rhythm that offered strength and faith, and the town gradually opened out into a sequence of wider, more regular crossings, many of them offering odd, metallic sculptures at their centres. These were huge and angled, impossible creations that rose high above the buildings and that defied Akemi’s comprehension. Jencir had recorded these, his drawings exquisite and exact – but she had not understood his extrapolations. Now, the moss had covered and blurred the metal. Thick and dark and rust-red, it clung to the sculptures, and to the stone, and to the fountainsides. It choked the waterflow, and it suffocated the flowers in the untended gardens. It swelled from the windows as if the very buildings were clogging from the inside. Surely, there had not been time for the moss to grow that thickly? Even the air felt thick, infecting their very breathing. Akemi could almost feel it, growing in her lungs. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta, however, showed little interest in the metalworks – she had seen them before. Instead, she gave the gesture for the squad to move on. Again and again, Akemi saw Viola kneel and watch, saw Caia pause to use the auspex, straining to find something – anything – some ghost of motion, some hint of life. And every time, she responded in the negative, and she and Viola ran on. ‘Where are they all?’ Melia asked, her words soft with horror. ‘Where did they go?’ Like Felicity, the entire population of the town had simply… …vanished. Akemi shuddered, sweat still sliding over her skin. She remembered running the gantries of the Sorex, the endless, repetitive drills. They’d been training missions to make her combat-responses reflexive, she knew that – but out here, the safety of the clattering metal walkways seemed very far away. ‘I feel like something’s watching me,’ Melia went on. ‘Or like something’s growing–’ ‘We walk in His light,’ Augusta said, her voice like steel. ‘With me, Sisters. From the curse of the mutant…’ ‘…Our Emperor, deliver us.’ Slowly, the buildings grew taller, more decorous. As they turned, at last, into a wide and ornate plaza, Akemi paused, surprised. More of the metal sculptures loomed here, brass and rust and steel – and these were even larger, stretching upwards into the mist. There was a circle of them, like twisted dancers, all fathomless and extreme. And they looked… wrong, somehow, their angles distorted, their struts and cogs and pipes a mystery and all covered in rot. With an odd flicker, Akemi understood that the other sculptures, the smaller ones, had all been part of the same construction and shape. Pieces of the same thing, perhaps? Jencir had drawn this one also, his recreation meticulous. ‘Wait. Sisters, wait!’ Augusta paused. As the Sister Superior nodded, Akemi moved to study the closest, to walk around it until she found what she was looking for… Writing. She blinked. Jencir had drawn this too, and the symbols were unknown to her. They seemed to writhe across the metal rather than being engraved within it. For a moment, the fear in her throat almost threatened to choke her. ‘What does it say?’ Caia asked her, auspex still in hand. The scanner was flickering, and its green light played on the sculpture’s metal. ‘I cannot read this, Sister,’ Akemi said, apologising. ‘It is not a language I comprehend.’ ‘Is this not machine dialect?’ Augusta asked, surprised. ‘We had concluded that these came from Mars, from the Ring of Iron. As the town and the ziggurat were first built by the Great Crusade, so the machines of the Mechanicus…’ Her voice faltered, and it was enough to bring Akemi out in a fresh sweat. Seeking reassurance, she said, ‘Sister, Jencir showed much interest in these… creations. They captivated him. But if this is – was – a machine, then its spirit is long, long dead.’ A ghost seemed to pass across all of them – a shiver of something other, something beyond their experience or comprehension. Melia was nervous, restlessly checking the empty roads; Caia was studying the auspex, as if puzzled by its behaviour. ‘What did his notes say?’ Augusta asked Akemi. ‘Exactly?’ ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I could not read his records very well.’ She had an urge to reach for her fetish, dismissed it. ‘He speculated a twenty-nine-point-eight per cent possibility that the machinery had been for ­mining, a thirty-four-point-two per cent possibility that its purpose had been construction. Those percentages… are not very high.’ The notes had gone into painstaking and unreadable detail, but Akemi paused as Augusta commented, ‘Then what would be the purpose of such devices?’ ‘I do not know,’ Akemi said. She offered her ignorance hesitantly, as if she expected a reprimand. But Augusta tapped a boot, thinking. ‘Did he offer speculation? A source – or purpose?’ ‘No, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Not that I could read.’ Restless, Viola kicked at a stone and sent it scuttling across the plaza. ‘Desist.’ Augusta snapped the order at the impatient younger Sister, and turned back to the metalwork. She considered it for a moment longer, then moved as if she’d made a decision. ‘Thank you, Sister Akemi. We will keep this information for the future. For now, we cannot make use of it. Jatoya, hold this point. Akemi, with me. There’s something else here that I need to check.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya commanded the squad to a compass defence, watching every approach; Augusta directed Akemi to the building beside the sculpture. It was the largest one they’d seen, the patterns on its walls more elaborate than the rest, and it was almost smothered in the thick, rusty lichen, creeping from its insides like decay. Her blood thumping, her mind still reciting the words of the litany, Akemi moved to the door. And stopped, her heart suddenly in her mouth. ‘Throne!’ Her exclamation was involuntary, and she knew Augusta was behind her, and she knew the drills. Controlling her initial shock, she dropped to one knee, her bolter covering the mess. Augusta swore, her words vicious enough to almost make Akemi blush. This building had a much larger living space, a room big enough to accommodate a group – maybe a town meeting or council. Its interior walls were carved in incredible patterns, and they lit its inside to a thick, green light. Behind her, Augusta’s voice was grim. ‘So, there was fighting here after all.’ In the living space, there were signs of a struggle. The furniture had been smashed and scattered, the rugs torn from the doorways. Augusta’s chainsword, still silent, pointed past Akemi’s shoulder, and the younger woman looked down. The floor-rug was shredded, as if by frantically scrabbling hands. Pieces of bright fabric were scattered across the black stone, alongside what looked like a familiar votive candle. But they were not what Augusta had indicated. Beside the rug’s remains, there was a long, rough smear, harder to see against the rock. But it looked like something – or someone – had been dragged from the building. Dragged, and fighting all the way. Following the line of the marks, Akemi found herself looking at a stain on the bottom corner of the doorway, right by her foot. One that looked very much like fingers, grasping at a forlorn and final hope. ‘Kawa Koumu lived here.’ Augusta named the priest who had governed her people, who had fought the orks as best she could, and who had welcomed the Sisters as protectors. ‘She was a good woman, strong in her faith.’ The Sister Superior stepped past Akemi and into the room, her armoured shoulders rigid with anger, and with tight, personal control. She picked up the candle and put it in its niche on the wall. ‘Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Whatever took her, it took her out towards the ziggurat.’ She used the muzzle of her weapon to gesture at the lines on the floor, how they curved when they passed the doorway. ‘She did not go willingly.’ ‘I doubt she would have,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak. ‘But why the priest?’ Akemi asked her. ‘This is the only place we’ve seen fighting. Why would she, alone, offer resistance?’ Augusta had crouched and was inspecting the stains. From behind them, Jatoya’s rejoinder was dark. ‘Perhaps because she was the only one that could.’ Akemi caught her breath, stopped herself from cursing. Gesturing for Akemi to remain in the doorway, Augusta moved carefully through the debris, shifting it with the end of her chainsword. But though they searched every corner, there was nothing else to find. They left Kawa’s home, and turned at last into the centre of the town. Here, close and looming, stood the ziggurat. It was huge and stern, its dark flanks stepped, its head and shoulders rising high above the levels of roofs and trees. The mist curled round its sides, making the stone gleam with moisture; carved warriors decorated its sides and two armoured figures stood like twin guards at the foot of its long flight of steps. And, at its peak, a lone figure waited, His chin lifted, His head haloed in light-rays. Akemi paused. The others may have seen this before, but this ancient depiction of the God-Emperor was new to her, and wondrous. She touched one gauntlet to the front of her armour and bowed her head. But the ziggurat, too, was blotched in moss. Viola muttered, her tones vicious. Here, the stains seemed a travesty, a confrontation – and the sight of them prickled the hairs on Akemi’s neck. And it wasn’t just at the moss, not just its blasphemous invasion of the stone; it was the creeping, suffocating anxiety that had been with them from the moment they’d left the Arvus. As Melia had said, it felt like they were being watched, like there was something lurking in one of the moss-splotched buildings, or in the surrounding streets. It was something dark, something inhuman, something hidden in the hot mist. Something that had all of them in its sights. But they had, at least, found the population of the town. Under the ziggurat, there lay bodies. At first, Akemi didn’t realise what she was seeing – the people lay in a wide half-circle, almost as if they were sky-gazing. Foolishly, she thought at first that they were unwell, and that she was seeing some sort of outdoor valetudinarium. And then she realised that the faint blur to her vision was not the smear of heat in her preysight. It was the flies. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ The curse was Melia, quiet with shock. ‘Sister?’ Augusta’s bark was subdued. Melia said, ‘They’re all dead. Have been for some time.’ She sounded shaken. ‘Whatever killed them must have laid them out like this. Done it deliberately.’ Akemi knew what would happen to a corpse, left outside and in this heat. She paused, her fear clamouring at her; she raised her eyes to the ancient God-Emperor as if asking Him for help. ‘Viola,’ Augusta said. ‘Follow the outside of the plaza until we get full visibility. If something has left this here intentionally, it could well be an ambush.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Akemi!’ Augusta’s bark was sharp in her vox-bead. ‘Move!’ Akemi jumped, did as she was ordered. They moved onwards, more cautiously now, circling the bodies and the lined grey-green of the plaza itself. It seemed almost that the blood-rust moss had started from here, had flowed outwards from the ziggurat’s foot and had spread like corrosion through the deserted streets. And then, Akemi saw something else. Every single one of the dead townspeople had been… ‘Where are their heads?’ Viola voiced her exact thought. Akemi faltered, stopped. The moss was in her lungs and she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t… A morte perpetua… ‘That’s not the only problem,’ Caia said. ‘Sisters, the plinth…’ ‘Hold this location.’ Augusta’s command was almost unnecessary; the Sisters had halted in a combat half-wheel, their backs to the nearest wall. They bristled bolters in every direction, waiting for that lurking foe, for that darkness that had stalked them through the town. …Domine, libra nos. Akemi, holding to the litany like she’d held to her little fetish, looked over at the single basalt plinth that occupied the centre of the plaza, and the foot of the ziggurat’s steps. A single figure lay upon it. It was arched backwards, chest thrown out, as if it still struggled, but it had been dead for many days. Its flesh had bloated and blackened, and it had started to decay. The flies hovered over it, fat and lazy. Its head, too, was gone. Its ribcage had been cracked open and parted like doors; its internal organs were ­liquefying in the heat. Black stains covered its robes and had spread down the sides of the plinth – black stains that now swelled with the thick, rust-red moss. She caught the stench and gagged. ‘Kawa,’ Augusta said, the word a breath, grieving. The Sister Superior dropped to one knee, touched one hand to the front of her armour. ‘Fighting to the last. Walk in His light, my friend.’ The Sisters repeated, ‘Walk in His light.’ Stretched out in some barbarous and heretical sacrifice, the town priest had lost her battle against whatever had dragged her from her home. Beneath the ziggurat, beneath the ancient stone gaze of the Emperor Himself, she had been executed – and in some vile act of mockery, in some rite of blood-worship that Akemi could not understand. But she made herself look, think. Kawa’s wrists and ankles showed no signs of restraints. It suggested that she had been rendered incapable of fighting, or that something – somethings – had been holding her down. And around her, her people lay headless, their blood staining the stone. Augusta said, ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, that Thou shouldst spare none…’ Reciting the litany, her chant grew in tension, and her voice trilled with tightly controlled fury. Akemi knew the squad’s history – the priest had been their friend and supporter, had welcomed them, as she’d welcomed Sister Felicity. ‘…That Thou shouldst pardon none, we beseech Thee, destroy them.’ The squad answered her. Viola’s voice seethed as she shaped the words. Jatoya’s deep tones were soaked in a low throb of pure wrath. Augusta looked up at the ziggurat as though she made her promise to the Emperor Himself. ‘Whatever did this, we will find it. ‘And we will be its ending.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Lautis cathedral was not as Augusta remembered it. Walking down the ruined aisle, the building hollow and roofless over her head, the Sister Superior let her boots ring from the stone. Kawa’s fate and the desecration of the town had left her tight with anger, and she walked bolter in hand, the weapon issuing an outright challenge to whatever was lurking here. With her, her squad walked in double-file. But they could not reach the steps. Unlike their previous visit, the nave was filled with rubble – tumbled pillars, collapsed walls, smashed pieces of fallen buttresses. Augusta knew the pattern of krak grenade debris all too well; she recognised the scars in the stonework where the ammunition of her Sisters had chewed chunks from the rock. She halted, Caia behind her, auspex in hand. ‘Full suppression bursts,’ Caia said. ‘Bolter and heavy bolter alike.’ She paused, studying the spreads of the scars. ‘They fought a retreating action, backwards, up the aisle.’ Turning slowly, studying the instrument in her hand, she pointed. ‘There!’ From beneath the rubble she saw a single, augmetic foot, grip-talons extended as if in some final act of rage or pain. Scatters of warm rain misted across the air. Augusta knelt, carefully moving the rocks. ‘Common construction servitor.’ The thing was smashed to a pulp, the flesh parts of its face rotting and the cogs in its skull all starting to corrode. ‘Melia?’ ‘Been dead longer than the townspeople.’ Melia dropped to one careful knee beside the Sister Superior and turned what was left of the head with a red-gauntleted hand. ‘Flesh doesn’t last in this climate – there’s nothing left but tools and circuitry.’ ‘Jatoya, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved more of the fallen stone. The heap groaned and shifted; scatters of dust and pebbles rolled down its sides. Slowly, they exposed more of the thing, its chest a disintegrating mess of cybernetic organs, its left arm ending in a heavy, stonecutter saw. Its right arm was completely missing. ‘It was fighting something.’ Melia tapped the dried stains on the sawblade. Augusta nodded. ‘They must have been surrounded, or overwhelmed.’ ‘But what could do this?’ Melia asked her. ‘What could move with this sort of swiftness? Overwhelm a squad of our Sisters and a contingent of fully-equipped construction servitors?’ ‘And was it the same thing that emptied the town?’ Augusta’s question was rhetorical; she was still moving the rubble, searching. ‘I do not yet comprehend this, Sisters, not this place and its mysteries, and not this foe. I fear that there are darker things here than orks.’ Melia said nothing. The other four had deployed to a compass defence, covering pillars and archways; Caia still moved her auspex in careful arcs. Augusta’s mention of the orks had returned the memory of their previous battle, and the squad had no intention of being caught a second time. The Sister Superior moved more of the pile. It shuddered and shifted, exposing a second, semi-human body, this one with its face all but missing. She looked down at it, gauging. Servitors could put up a hard and nasty fight – there were worse melee weapons than heavy construction tools. And, like Melia, she did not understand what could have overcome them so swiftly. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We scout by twos, roll call every ninety seconds. Melia, with me. This puzzle requires an answer.’ The squad deployed as it had done once before, spreading out to explore what was left of the transept and cloisters. Augusta kept Melia with her, needing the woman’s medical training – Melia was not a Hospitaller, but her field knowledge was excellent. What they found were pieces. The dismembered remains of the servitors were spread throughout the nave – almost as if some predator had gone on a hunting rampage and had scattered leftovers in its wake. Not one of the corpses remained intact: many of them were missing heads, or limbs, or tools, or tracks. Many more had been disembowelled and their internal organs spread out around them. Yet they found no sign of Jencir himself – and nothing to show what had happened to the Sisters. Melia picked up a servitor’s detached clamp-arm and turned it over. ‘This was bitten,’ she said. She held it out. ‘What can bite through plasteel?’ ‘Very big teeth,’ Augusta commented, taking the limb to examine it. Over the vox, Viola said, ‘There were gun-servitors in the east transept. There’s no sign of whatever took them down.’ ‘Which way are they facing?’ Augusta asked. ‘They’re a mess,’ Viola commented. ‘But my instincts say the attack came from the nave.’ ‘Understood,’ Augusta said. ‘Keep looking.’ ‘Aye.’ Picking their way past the fallen stonework, pieces of it as large as an immolator tank, Augusta and Melia reached the bottom of the steps. Electro-candles had been left here, one on each step climbing towards the altar, but they stood rusting and lightless, now – forgotten. But still, not a single flash of scarlet armour. Bitten. A suspicion was starting to grow in Augusta’s heart. Over the vox, Jatoya’s voice said, ‘West transept clear, proceeding into the cloisters. Looks like the repairs started as scheduled, Sister, there’s a full support framework out here, platforms and scaffolding.’ ‘What of the defences?’ ‘Gun-servitors here, too,’ Jatoya said. ‘Weapons are still half-loaded. Whatever took them down was fast.’ Augusta’s suspicion was solidifying with every word Jatoya said. She paused before the top step. The drop to her knee was as much a part of her faith as drawing breath, but this time, she stayed standing. And her hand tightened on her bolter as the anger surged in her soul. On the Emperor’s high altar, there sat a skull. Just the one. It was – or had been – human, but its plates and eyestalks and mechadendrites identified it easily. Jencir. It had been flayed of all skin and placed in the altar’s centre, exactly where the Holy Aquila should have been. To one side of it lay a rosarius. To the other, a single fleur-de-lys blade. All three items were stained with dried and flaking blood. It had been poured lavishly over them. It had streamed from Jencir’s eye sockets; it had covered the top of the altar, coated its sides and spread out across the stone like a stain. A flicker of sweat stole across Augusta’s skin – like an echo of a dark disquiet. I know this… Melia had stopped at her shoulder. Softly, the Sister Superior murmured a prayer – for the tech-priest, for the profaned altar. She spent a long moment looking, then she stepped onto the top step, the Holy of Holies. With a surge of anger and the slam of one armoured fist, she knocked the skull sideways. It clattered across the chancel and rolled to a stop. ‘Noli timere,’ she said. ‘Feruntur Lucem.’ The words were soft, aimed at the bloodstains, at the dark and eerie creeping in her skin. I do not fear you. I carry the Light. Carefully she picked up the blade and the rosarius and tucked them into her belt. Then she turned around and drew the chainsword with a rasp that echoed down through the nave. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘To me. We are played.’ Melia had put her back to the altar stone, was covering the approach with her bolter. ‘What do you mean?’ Augusta’s suspicions had become a certainty, cold and hard. ‘This was a gift,’ she said. ‘A taunt.’ She stood still, framed by the desecrated altar, by the empty window where the Emperor should have been, resplendent in glassiac and glory. ‘All of you, to me.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya’s tones were dangerous; Augusta could hear the squad moving, running for the steps. ‘I have faced this foe before,’ she told them. ‘Witnessed the depths of the horror it brings. It thirsts for blood, and for warfare. It haunts my dreams, and it wakes me in a cold sweat.’ The admission was a warning, not a weakness. ‘And it knows that other members of the Order must come, seeking their Sisters.’ She turned to look through the nave, searching. ‘It has been waiting for us.’ Then she snapped, ‘Like that!’ Unsurprised, she used the blade to point down the steps, indicating a curl of red flesh that crept around the base of a pillar. The motion was sinewy and horribly familiar. It brought a mouthful of anger and bile, echoes of images she could never forget. But her faith burned fiercely and she held herself still, her flickers of fear and fury absolutely controlled. She said, ‘What has teeth that could bite through plasteel?’ Melia cursed. ‘What in Dominica’s name is that? It looks like it’s been…’ ‘Skinned alive.’ She knew these things, these things that brought terror like a herald, like a rush of sickness to their hearts. ‘There.’ She pointed the blade again, at another one, a second slide of hot, red skin. ‘And there.’ And at another, around the pillar opposite. At a fourth, a fifth. Blade still in her hand, she raised her bolter, and began to recite the Litany of Mettle. ‘Et Tu quaeris tibi fortitudinem stare coram nobis…’ We stand before You and ask for Your strength… And more and more of them crept into her line of sight. Augusta knew exactly what the creatures were, had faced them before. On the industrial world of Hephaestus, down in the heart of the ash-choked mines, too much death had summoned them, and they had come. Come hunting. The things were quadrupedal and big; their spiked and sloping shoulders were the height of Augusta’s hip. They had long, yellow fangs, and eyes that burned with unholy light, bright as bloodlust and cruelty. Some had horns on their muzzles; others had back-ridges that spread like batwings. But every single one of them was as red as glistening gore, as red as a newly flayed victim, as red as the Sisters’ own armour. As they crept forwards, they stared, unblinking, at the women. ‘Flesh hounds,’ Augusta said. ‘Denizens of Ruin.’ She held the gaze of the lead beast and stared it down, confronting the fear, the memories. Her heart pounded as the litany trilled through the vox. ‘They can tear through flesh and bone and metal. Overwhelm servo-skulls and servitors alike.’ Beside her, Melia had bolter in hand, but her aim was trembling as she watched the things slink low across the floor. They moved like blood, like the rise of night, and the fear came off them in a wave. Augusta raised her bolter, but she did not fire, not yet. She watched. She watched as more and more of them came into view. They skulked behind the rubble-piles; they lurked in the half-light. Their eyes glowed with hellish colours, and steam rose from their backs. She felt like she was struggling to breathe, like there was a knot of tension in the top of her chest. ‘Single shots,’ she said. ‘Aim carefully and conserve your ammunition – there may be more. Hold steady, my Sisters. The fear is but an illusion, a trick of the dark. His light is with us.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia raised her bolter and shot a creature in the face. It shook its head and growled at her, teeth bared. Saliva sizzled as it hit the stone. At the sound, the others started to snarl, a low, bubbling rasp. It echoed throughout the ruin, rising in volume and fury. The air grew thicker still. Augusta’s grip tightened on blade and bolter both. Then she heard Jatoya, ‘A morte perpetua!’, saw the fierce whoosh of fire as it leapt in an arc from one side. Two of the creatures exploded into flame; one of them staggered. It voiced a horrific, hollow howling, a sound that almost tore the litany from the air… …and then it detonated, a nightmare banished. The flames flickered in its wake. The second beast, its flesh burning, turned and threw itself at the women. Beside Jatoya, Akemi hesitated for just too long; the beast landed full on her chest, knocking her over. Eyes and skin afire, its sharp, slavering teeth went for her gorget. Frantically, she scrabbled backwards, her bolter lost, both panicked hands reaching for the thing’s bronze collar. Jatoya leaned down and picked the hound up, one-handed, almost without effort. With pure, physical strength, she slammed it bodily against the nearest pillar. Augusta heard it crack. It fell to the floor, twitching, burning. Firmly, Jatoya brought her boot down on its skull. It exploded with a force that sprayed blood across armour and stone. The flicker of the remaining flames made the building dance with shadows. Jatoya reached her gauntlet to pull Akemi to her feet. ‘Never freeze in battle,’ she said. Her voice was firm but carried no judgment. ‘You know this, Sister. There is no fear. The Emperor is with you.’ ‘Aye.’ Akemi’s tone was full of failure. ‘Say it, Sister Akemi.’ ‘The Emperor is with me.’ Nodding, Jatoya raised the Litany of Battle and Augusta saw Akemi raise her head; she felt her own blood surge in response. She saw Viola stop by a headless pillar, check her field of fire and then take down a single creature with a short, precise burst. Caia called, ‘My auspex is broken, I think. But there are more incoming, Sisters. They’re everywhere!’ Augusta said, ‘To me, all of you. We will hold at the altar!’ They ran. Behind them, the growl rose in volume. It sounded eager, like hunger made manifest, like the creatures of the darkest teachings brought to snarling life. But Augusta knew this, remembered it – she held to the words of the litany and took aim on a skulking hound. Beside her, Melia fired careful, single shots, her breathing tight with fear. The creatures’ snarls grew louder; they were coiling to spring, and any minute now… ‘Viola!’ The other four Sisters had raced up the steps. As she reached Augusta’s location, Viola turned, raised the heavy bolter and cursed. ‘All the rubble’s in the way…’ As Augusta had done, she took the final step, right up to the altar, and turned around. ‘Now.’ Viola grinned, the thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands. ‘Sentio de ira Imperatoris!’ The weapon roared into full life. With it, she thundered the words of the litany. All through the nave, the hounds reeled under the suppression. They shuddered and twisted and crumpled under the impacts. They tried to flee but instead whimpered and detonated, vanishing back to the warp. Some staggered sideways, leaving red smears on the floor, others broke into a full lope, leaping forwards with froth on their chests and their teeth bared. Still more, further back, tried to duck behind the rubble, but Viola’s elevation meant they had nowhere to hide. Music and gunfire boomed from the headless walls. Stone rumbled, and the remains of a pillar cascaded down over the aisle, crushing the hounds beneath. A red mist rose in their wake. Augusta shouted, ‘Hold!’ The bolter was silenced, and the quiet was deafening. Dust blew through the air. ‘Caia.’ Caia said, ‘The screen keeps glitching, I can’t read it properly.’ Viola went to move, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘Stay there. Reload.’ Unmoving, almost unbreathing, the Sisters watched the nave. Augusta watched the auspex in Caia’s hand. Its light flickered and danced. It showed nothing. No motion. No life. The whole cathedral seemed to hold its breath, waiting. And then… One blip. Two. Five. Ten. All clustered down by the main doorway. ‘Where are they coming from?’ Akemi asked. ‘From the crypts,’ Augusta told her, watching the auspex. ‘Viola?’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Hold until I give the word.’ More of the red shapes were coming back into view now, creeping up the ruined aisle. Augusta said, ‘Jatoya, guard our backs. Akemi, that one, there.’ She pointed her chainsword at the nearest snarling hound. ‘Shoot it.’ ‘Sister?’ ‘Shoot it, Sister Akemi, and then keep shooting. Single shots, to the head if you can.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Aware of Akemi’s tension, Augusta took up the litany once more, and felt the younger woman steady. Akemi raised her bolter in both hands, sighted on the bared teeth of the lead hound and pulled the trigger. She hit it clean in the face. Its skull exploded with the impact; the body twisted and was gone. More gore splashed across the stone. ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Like that.’ Augusta shot another, and another. She kept speaking over the barking of the weapon, over the rhythm of the litany. ‘For every stain they’ve made upon this cathedral, we’ll make one of our own. For every death brought by Chaos, we’ll bring a death for the Light of the Emperor. Keep firing, Sister Akemi, and feel His light as you do.’ With Viola still standing above them, heavy bolter in her hands and waiting for the order to resume, the Sisters of the Order raised their voices to the broken walls and shot at the incoming hounds. But the air was still thickening, still choking them. The beasts surged forwards, and Melia fell back. ‘Sister! I… can’t…’ ‘I said keep firing!’ Augusta’s order was a sharp bark. ‘Switch to short bursts, these things cannot be permitted to reach the altar!’ Impossibly, their numbers were still swelling; a seething mass of scarlet that covered the floor of the nave and flowed higher and higher over the rubble. Augusta could feel Viola’s tautness – feel her itching to open fire. She shouted, ‘Now!’ Again, the heavy bolter roared and the beasts smashed backwards in the sudden blast of destruction. But there were too many of them – as the ones in the centre exploded, one after another, there came others, surging at the flanks. Caia cried out as one bounded up at her, teeth bared and hellish eyes glowing. As it opened its jaws, she fell back, tried to put the bolter muzzle in its mouth. But it was too close, and its teeth closed on her elbow. She cried out. Her armour splintered as the thing bit down, and her voice hit a crescendo of pain. She couldn’t use her bolter, but then Melia was beside her, shouting, clubbing the thing on the head with her own weapon, over and over and over again, finding a release for her fear in the sheer fury of the action. Augusta barked an order. Both women fell back as the heavy bolter turned its suppression towards that side of the steps. But the weapon clunked to a stop as the magazine emptied. Cursing, Viola reached for another. Augusta turned and beheaded the closest hound, but they were still coming. Still snarling. And the fear was still clamouring in her chest. The Sister Superior knew that Sister Felicity Albani must have done this. Exactly this. Faced these monsters, this onslaught. And Felicity had surely fallen. But her squad would not. Could not. As Viola replaced her magazine and opened fire once more, as the full suppression drove the beasts back, Augusta prayed aloud. Because she knew, as Felicity must have known, that these were only the vanguard. Somewhere, they had huntmasters, monsters that drove them on. Like the flesh hounds themselves: daemons. Her hand tightened on the bolter. Daemons that had ripped their way through the mines of Hephaestus, driving the people to madness and screaming death. Daemons that had profaned this altar, this place of the Saint and of the God-Emperor. Daemons that had slain her Sisters. Viola gave a shout of defiance and victory – the tide was beginning to falter. Augusta gave her the command to drop back, but still the Sister Superior did not lose her focus. She raised her own weapon to blow the last of them away. But the fight, she knew, was only beginning.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX The hounds had left no corpses. Daemons of the warp, they had exploded, they had twisted and folded and faded. And like the echoes of bright lights on closed eyes, they had left red smears across Augusta’s vision. Caia stood with her hand wrapped over her elbow, blood oozing between the fingers of her gauntlet. The wound was deep, but Melia was beside her, chirurgeon’s tools ready. ‘Witch bane and tetraporfaline,’ she said. ‘This will cleanse and heal the wound. Can you move your elbow?’ ‘Not very well,’ Caia said. ‘I feel foolish, letting it get that close.’ She turned to Augusta. ‘What did you say these were?’ Neither Sister had been there upon Hephaestus; they’d never seen these beasts before, never felt their hot breath, never witnessed the destruction they could bring. ‘They’re flesh hounds,’ Augusta said. ‘Khorne’s pets.’ Her voice was tight with anger. ‘They hunt us, test our mettle, wear us down.’ ‘Sister Felicity fought these things?’ Viola asked. ‘I would think so,’ Augusta said. ‘But these are not the things that slew Kawa, nor emptied the town.’ She paused, then said, ‘No, somewhere, these things have a master. Something with purpose.’ Her boot tapped, restless, on the stone. ‘And whatever that purpose may be, we must prevent it. Sisters, we have been called here for this, exactly this. We carry His blade, His bolter, and His name. The forces of darkness cannot withstand us. And we do not fear.’ Augusta placed her gauntleted hand on Akemi’s shoulder. ‘Confidunt in Eo, Akemi. Believe.’ ‘I believe.’ The young woman’s response was fervent. Her bolter had taken lives now, and it had not left her hand. And she had not hesitated again. ‘He is with me.’ ‘Always,’ Augusta said. She let Akemi go, then pulled the data-slate from her belt to call up the maps that Felicity had left them. A wash of pale light bathed their armour. ‘We will progress into the crypts,’ she said. ‘Here.’ She pointed, then indicated various other lines on the map. ‘They’re simple, underchapel, valetudinarium, reliquary – we observed them upon our previous reconnaissance.’ ‘The shipmaster said there were no life signs,’ Viola commented. ‘The density of the stone could have defeated the scans,’ Caia told her. ‘The Sister Superior is right – these beasts must have come from below.’ Jatoya commented, ‘They always come from below.’ Jatoya had been there, upon Hephaestus. Like Augusta, she remembered the screaming. The fire. The hooks. ‘But…’ Viola studied the map, confused. ‘There’s not enough room. How can they?’ ‘A breach in the warp, perhaps,’ Jatoya commented. ‘Though such things are relatively rare.’ Augusta said, ‘Or simply enough bloodshed, somewhere beneath this building… The false gods of Chaos can ­manifest wherever such deeds are performed, even if it is not in their names.’ ‘I have a suggestion.’ The voice was Akemi’s, surprising Augusta slightly, but she let the young woman speak. ‘During the Great Crusade, the cathedrals of the Emperor were often built upon older, local sites. Perhaps this is true of the town?’ ‘Just so.’ Augusta placed the data-slate back in the pack. ‘It may perhaps explain the town’s metalworks – dead things, left over from the Age of Strife.’ The thought made her pause as something in her mind caught on the presence of the tech-priest. Jencir had volunteered for this mission to Lautis, and now she found herself wondering why. She considered for a moment, then banished the thought in favour of more practical matters. ‘I suspect the crypts are not as we remember them.’ Viola snorted, counting her remaining ammunition. She pulled the half-empty magazine from the heavy bolter and replaced it with a full one, slamming the thing home with a noise like pure defiance. ‘Whatever’s lurking down there,’ she said, ‘we will send it straight back to the hell it came from.’ ‘We will cleanse this place,’ Jatoya told her. ‘By His light,’ Augusta said. She sheathed her sword almost regretfully. ‘Viola, on point. Jatoya take the rear. Akemi, stay by me. We fear neither rift nor daemon.’ The crypts were high and vaulted, their ceilings and pillars all swarming with dark clusters of roots. Navigating by jury-rigged strips of lumens – more evidence of Jencir’s explorations – the Sisters came to the bottom of the dipped-smooth steps. Before them, stone sarcophagi lay in a silent circle. Some bore recumbent, robed statues upon their lids, each with his or her hands still crossed in the sign of the aquila. They had been swept clear of dust, and candles left upon them. By the dates on their sides, these were the cathedral’s builders, more recent than the Great Crusade. But something had changed. The air down here should have been still, thick with age. Last time, there had been a single, root-clogged exit – a gap that opened out into an old oubliette – but that had been all. Now a hot wind blew past them like the exhalation from a planet-core forge. ‘No motion,’ Caia said. Her wound had been bound and treated, but the vambrace of her armour was in pieces, and they could not afford to go back for a replacement. Her left gauntlet was missing completely, her hand and forearm bandaged, but bare. ‘But the air’s at thirty-three degrees, and the humidity’s fallen significantly.’ They held a defensive formation while Caia continued to scan. Then she said, ‘It’s coming from the valetudinarium.’ And there it was – the error that Augusta had made. Something so simple, and something that the tech-priest must have found so easily. The room had changed. Augusta remembered it as small – a hospice to serve the people of the town. Now, it stretched outwards, far beyond her memory of it and back into the dark – a huge stone chamber, crumbling with age. Augusta could see where the rubble from the previous wall was tumbled at the room’s edges; the marks of Jencir’s servitors were still visible in the stone. Beside her, Caia watched the auspex. She shook her head as Augusta glanced around. ‘Nothing.’ ‘Look,’ Akemi said, pointing. ‘What’s that?’ Amid the tumbled stone at the wallside, there were fragments that looked different – curves like carved armour. ‘I recall no statue,’ Augusta said. ‘Perhaps it was on the other side?’ Caia’s suggestion drew no answers. Akemi was already kneeling by the pile, finding more of the pieces. ‘It’s not very big,’ she said, finding another, and another, and fitting them like parts of a puzzle. ‘It must have been recessed into the wall.’ Viola stifled a grumble. ‘Do we have time for this?’ ‘Wait,’ Augusta said. Fragments laid out on the floor, the statue was coming together. ‘Sisters…!’ Akemi sat back on her heels. Augusta stared. The statue was familiar – a female figure with her sword held aloft. The blade itself was still missing, but the armour was just like their own… Augusta touched a hand to her fleur-de-lys, but said nothing. She watched as Akemi picked up the final pieces: the statue’s boots and plinth. Akemi said, ‘There’s an inscription.’ As the Sister Superior looked at her, she went on, ‘Fluxu sanguinis vitae nostrae, Et in supplementum it et liber: De quomodo eraserit magos et quod, Velint beatificare illos quasi impotens!’ She brushed at the dust. ‘It’s an older verse, and it means “our Blood and Sacrifice”, but it could… it could be translated in other ways. It could mean “bleeding for survival”, or “blood for our lives”… It must have been a part of the fallen wall.’ ‘Blood for our lives,’ Augusta repeated. The statue was the Saint herself, of course it was, but Augusta could make no sense of it. Why had she not seen it before? Why had it been on the other side of the wall? And in her head, she was remembering Hephaestus’ daemons – creatures of greed and laughter and cruelty. They’d slavered in the mines’ darkness, roared with flame and blood. Their appetites had been more than human, more than– Blood for our lives… She found herself shuddering, and stopped. ‘The curiosity of the Mechanicus is often their undoing,’ Jatoya commented. She indicated a fallen servo-skull, apparently crushed by the tumbling rock. ‘Whatever they loosed in here, it slew them all.’ Her words brought silence as they contemplated the darkness. Fear yammered at them, taunting at the edges of their awareness. The screaming. The fire. The hooks… ‘We are missing something,’ Augusta said. ‘Some piece of the history of this place…’ ‘Sister?’ Akemi stood up, curious. ‘I studied Lautis in some detail, and there is nothing–’ ‘Our answers lie ahead of us,’ Augusta said. ‘We will proceed.’ ‘Aye.’ Viola flicked on her suitlight. Jatoya said, her voice soft, ‘From the begetting of daemons…’ Taking up the prayer, they stepped out of the crypt’s illumination, and into the unknown. As they walked, the construction of the walls began to change. The stone became rougher cut, as if the work had been left somehow unfinished, and the air became steadily hotter and thicker. Augusta was not surprised to see the devices of the sanatorium: the suspended cages, the steel chairs with their swing-down bridles, the tiny cells set back against the walls. But – and the question loomed large in her mind – to whom had they actually belonged? Here, the symbols of the Creed had gone. They had been replaced with odd, geometric designs that looked more like the unnamed machinery in the centre of the town. Augusta stopped, struggling with her memories, with screams that, once again, were echoing in her mind. The town’s machines had come from the Age of Strife, but her understanding of that fact had been academic. Now, she found herself trying to encompass what that really meant. That this had been a godless world, a world of no faith. The concept made the place seem suddenly, horrifically empty. It was a vacuum, bereft of hope or purpose or meaning. Blood for our lives… Blood for the Blood God. For a moment, the horror threatened to bring her down. She longed for a warship – for the armaments to eradicate this hell-planet, once and for all… But she did not have that power, or that choice. She had her faith, and that was enough. The far end of the room opened out onto a balustrade, a walkway that circled the smooth edge of a pit. In the faint illumination of the Sisters’ curious suitlights, it seemed to stretch downwards to the planet’s very heart. When Augusta picked up a stone and dropped it over the edge, there was no sound of it hitting the bottom. About her, the squad had drawn together, tension in their voices as they recited their prayers. Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, and even Viola seemed subdued – her grip on the heavy bolter was vice-tight, as if the weapon was the focus of her courage. On the far side of the room, across the yawning threat of the pit, there waited five – six – other entranceways, each a carved arch in the rock. They were crumbling, layered with moss and roots and vast age. Too regular for mining tunnels – but it no longer mattered. The squad needed to progress, to face their fears, and to find the masters of the hounds… ‘Catacombs.’ Melia shuddered. ‘I wonder what’s down there.’ No one offered an answer. With no choice, they ventured onwards. But Caia’s sense of direction was as sharp as her wits. Despite the still-flickering auspex, she directed them carefully and they moved downwards, always downwards. They passed rusting doorways into more cells, many of them empty. Some showed cold firepits, or elaborate metal frameworks, each sized to hold a human body. Several bore faded red tally marks, hundreds of them, decorating every wall – and leaving them with images of prisoners, abandoned and rotting in eternity. Sometimes, the squad encountered rockfalls or dead ends, and then had to loop back on themselves to try another route. And sometimes they paused, confused, convinced that they had explored this tunnel before. But at last, wordlessly weary, they stumbled into a second open space. And stopped. Here, the roots could no longer penetrate – but eight sarcophagi stood about the walls, each one bearing a grotesque face, its tear-ducts caked with fluid. At the room’s centre, there was a pool, stained to darkness with a layer of desiccating flakes. The chamber offered two further exits, each one carved in the shape of an open mouth. Still on point, Viola’s breathing was harsh. ‘Which way?’ she asked, paused at the entranceway, her head bowed. ‘Or are we just going to get lost again?’ ‘You try navigating,’ Caia answered her, tone sharpening. The Sisters were tired, and the fear of this place was strong – but such behaviour was not to be tolerated. ‘That’s enough.’ Augusta’s order brought silence. ‘This is frustrating, and I understand. But our faith is tested in many ways – and patience is one of them.’ The words were a warning, and the younger members of the squad fell silent. ‘Let us rest,’ Jatoya suggested. ‘And pray. Clear our minds and our hearts. We have good lines of sight and a defensible location. Fifteen-minute rotations for trail rations and water. Viola, Akemi, you first.’ ‘Aye.’ While Melia took a longer look at Caia’s injury, and Jatoya prowled restlessly, flamer in hand, the two chosen Sisters sat on the raised lip of the pool and removed their helmets. Viola’s red hair and freckled skin were sticky with sweat; with a slight shock, the Sister Superior saw that the young woman was more afraid than she’d realised. Viola was hiding it well, but her reactionary bravado was the only thing that was keeping her on her feet. And it may yet get her, and the squad, into trouble. Beside her, Akemi’s pale face was drawn and worried, her shining black bob of hair a curtain as she bowed her head. Augusta came to sit beside them. ‘Pray with me, Sisters,’ she said. ‘For courage to face the darkness. Ego veritatem tuam. Vos ipsi nos docuit non timere, quia tu omnia superare.’ I hold to Your truth. You have taught us not to fear, for You have overcome all. Leaving Caia to study the sarcophagi, Melia broke out the flatbreads that were their ration packs – condensed, super-nutritional foodstuffs that tasted like solidified gruel. As Augusta finished speaking, she handed one to each of the younger Sisters. Viola, her helmet in her lap, pulled a face. ‘Might be easier to starve.’ Her quip sounded almost like relief. It made Akemi laugh. The sound was so unexpected – and so utterly out of place – that Augusta turned away, hiding a smile. In the midst of all this horror, a prayer could still bring strength and joy. ‘Eat it,’ Melia said, her tones amused. ‘You cannot battle monsters on an empty belly.’ Caia had paused at one of the sarcophagi, frowning. ‘These are hollow,’ she said. She tapped the metal sculpture and then used her fleur-de-lys blade to prise the front of it open. Akemi leapt upright, spitting her rations across the stone. Augusta stared, her memories suddenly moving, curling like smoke… The screaming… The fire… The hooks… From inside had slumped a body, run through with two dozen metal spikes. The corpse was recent, dried out like old grox-leather, and still in the garb of the town. ‘The townsfolk came here?’ Caia said. Her voice was soaked in dismay. Wordless, Jatoya pointed her flamer-muzzle downwards, indicating the floor. At the sarcophagus’ feet, there was a gutter in the rock, a straight line that led to the pool. It, too, was caked in the now-familiar flaking darkness. ‘More blood,’ Augusta said. She was tense, shaking; her head echoed with remembered cries of pain. ‘And more blood. The taint of Chaos is strong here, and it lured them from their homes.’ ‘Perhaps it has been here from the beginning,’ Jatoya said, her tone bleak. ‘Soaked into the stone.’ Melia said, ‘Perhaps that’s why the wall in the valetudinarium was constructed. When the Great Crusade came to Lautis, the people wished to embrace the Light, to forget the bloodshed of their past–’ ‘The cathedral is younger than the Crusade,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘It was built many centuries later than the town.’ ‘Then perhaps it was built to convert the more reluctant,’ Caia said, ‘and then walled off when it was no longer of use. Either way–’ ‘Either way.’ Augusta said, her tone like steel. ‘We will cleanse this holy place of the presence of Chaos.’ ‘Maybe we should feed them some of this – it’s guaranteed to kill anything.’ Viola stashed the last of her rations, and clicked her helmet back into place. She picked up the heavy bolter, checked its ammunition. Jatoya said, ‘We will cut the rest of the break until we have a better location. Sister Caia?’ A glimmer of green bathed Caia’s faceplate. ‘Scanning.’ Augusta’s preysight could see the faint blur of warmth that came from each entrance, the constant, exhaled sigh that was the hot breath of Chaos. But they both glowed the same, neither brighter than the other. Caia shook her head, shrugged. ‘I’m sorry, Sister, I still have no reading. We could walk down here until we perished from exhaustion. Which way do we choose?’ The squad remained silent, oddly reluctant. Augusta could feel the darkness as if it blurred the sharp edges of her mind. She whispered, ‘Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris.’ Guide me, my Emperor. ‘Contact!’ Caia suddenly said, her voice like a pulse of alarm. ‘Left-hand tunnel.’ The prayer of thanks was a rush, a touch of His grace in the silence of this sweating hell. She said, ‘How close?’ The light from the auspex glittered green. ‘Five hundred yards,’ Caia said. ‘And closing.’ ‘Defensive formation, we’ll hold back from the doorway. Jatoya, watch the other exit.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘What is it?’ Viola’s tone was sharp. ‘More hounds?’ Caia said, ‘Too slow for hounds. Moving wrong.’ Then Augusta saw a faint flicker of light from the far side of the chamber. In the tunnel mouth opposite, there was a figure, a brass firebrand raised in one hand. It moved slowly, but the sight of it was completely unexpected. She stared. It was an ork, its bolt-on steel jaw pitted with rust-red moss. Viola raised the heavy bolter. ‘Wait!’ Augusta said, puzzled. Behind the ork came a second greenskin, this one smaller and slighter. Both creatures had great, carved scars in their hides, spikes of brass embedded in their skin. And then, behind them, came a woman in the garb of the township, her clothing torn and bloody, her eyes torn out. She carried an orkish axe in one thin hand. More figures closed in behind her, their flesh ripped open, their faces scarred with staples and stitches. And all of them stared at the Sisters with teeth bared and gazes that burned like fire. Like fanaticism. Every one of them, orks included, had the same symbol upon the flesh of their foreheads, etched there in dripping black fluid. Khorne. Tightly, Augusta let out her breath. The townspeople had not been slain – they’d deserted their homes and farms and workshops, left everything behind them. Kawa, the priest, had resisted, had fought and been executed – the headless bodies in the town plaza must have been those with the strength to have followed her. But the rest had faltered from their faith, drawn by some ancient, buried bloodlust that had stirred in their darkest hearts, in their deepest ancestry. Khorne. It made her wonder about the town’s strange machines – had they somehow been made of the darkness here, inspired by the long presence of Chaos? More figures were assembling now, eyes flaming with madness. Like the daemonic hounds, they had no sense; they were hungry, thirsty, greedy. Their teeth were bared in skull-grins. For an instant, everything was still. And then, howling, the horde came at them. The people had no weapons, no armour, no technology. They carried the occasional axe, left over from the orks’ raids, or farm tools brought from the town itself. Some bore pieces of Jencir’s fallen scaffolding. But they had nothing to face, or to resist, the Sisters’ bolters. ‘Viola!’ Augusta ordered. The first suppression cut them down in their scores. But they didn’t care; they threw themselves over the dead and the dying, and they just kept coming. Augusta knew what this was – knew what they were doing. This was just more blood, more lives, more fuel, but there was no other choice. If they did not defend themselves, these people would do their best to tear the Sisters to pieces. And they were heretics, and deserved no mercy. On another command, Viola fell back to reload and the other four bolters opened up. Melia chanted the litany in the vox, her voice angry. Always the gentlest of them, this was not how she saw her faith, and Augusta knew that she did not wish to do this. Yet still, she was a warrior to her core, and she fired without hesitation. A large, balding man pushed to the fore, a ball of flames seeming to burn in his overhanging belly. She took him down with a single shot. Somewhere, Augusta thought she could hear laughing, deep and harsh and exultant. ‘Hold!’ Viola had slammed another magazine in the bolter. ‘Sister?’ She raised the weapon, unsure what the Sister Superior was doing. ‘Hold your fire.’ The furious barking of the bolters stopped. The people kept coming, clawing over the top of one another. Their hands were covered in the blood of their fellows; they picked up fallen weapons and left their friends to suffer and die. They had no awareness of themselves, or of each other, or of what they had been. Or of the occasional greenskin, no different to the rest. ‘Cover me,’ Augusta said. Viola nodded. ‘Aye.’ The Sister Superior clipped her bolter back to her belt, drew her blade, but did not start the mechanism. She stepped in front of her squad and began to recite, her voice ringing from the stone. ‘Quod haereticum de prioribus surrexit. Videt Imperator non est Lux…’ The heretic has risen, he sees not the Emperor’s Light… Behind her, her squad joined the words of the Litany of Banishment, the strength of their faith fighting back against the mad eyes of the incoming villagers. But it was not enough. If Augusta had hoped to stop the people by the power of her faith alone, she was failing – the grip of the bloodlust was too old, and too strong. As they reached her, she slashed at first one and then another with the still-silent chainsword, then stepped back and gave the order for Viola to resume firing. The heavy bolter cut the people down and covered the stone in more blood, and more blood. Slowly, the runnels and the pool filled with it. Melia shook her head, but she raised her bolter and shot again. And then they saw something else.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN In among the people of the town, there was a face Augusta knew. An older face, male, lined with sun and smiling – she remembered his name as Subul. He had been one of Kawa’s followers, strong in his faith. Now he had the symbol of Khorne carved deep into his forehead, and his own blood was caked dark around his eyes. ‘Hold!’ She commanded the squad to cease fire. The people were stopping. They looked like the hounds, snarling and straining, but Subul seemed to be their leader and their voice, and they paused to let him come forwards. ‘I knew you would come back,’ he said to her. ‘Sister.’ His voice was deep and layered with power. He wore horror like a cloak. He raised his chin, facing her down. Around him, the villagers stared, their eyes full of lunacy. A single ork stood with them, as daemon-crazed as the rest. ‘It was you,’ Augusta said. ‘You led them here.’ ‘Of course.’ He grinned. ‘They followed me, and willingly. They dragged Kawa from her home, and offered her to the oldest god of all, the god of our past! Some offered their skulls, others… still wait for that honour.’ He spread his hands like a conjurer. ‘Witness,’ he said. ‘Innocent lives – the lives you once swore to protect and save. What will you do, Sister? Will you gun them down?’ ‘They have turned from the Light,’ Augusta said. ‘Forsaken the Emperor–’ ‘Emperor, Emperor, Emperor.’ Subul snorted. ‘What is your Emperor but a corpse? What is your Emperor but a rotting excuse for your barbarous acts? How many times have you witnessed his punishments, the horrors done in his name – they all lurk here, Sister, you have seen them! We are the same, you and I – soaked in the blood of innocents.’ He was staring at her, his expression livid, intense. ‘Join us, Augusta. Join us as your Sisters did.’ What? That stung. Her hand tightened on her blade and she stood to her full height, inhaling the hot stink. ‘Felicity would not surrender her faith. She is a member of the Order, a follower–’ ‘Of Saint Mina?’ His laugh was harsh, mocking, laden with implication. ‘Felicity saw the truth, Augusta. Saw the truth of your Order’s history, its thirst for blood. Saw what you red-clad women really are.’ ‘You will perish by my hand,’ Augusta told him. ‘By my faith.’ ‘You and your false God.’ Subul grinned, the expression savage and somehow wider than his face. His teeth were sharp and coated in gore, in shreds of flesh. ‘Do you not know where you are, Sister Superior, where you have blundered in your ignorance and your blind faith? You have your eyes so fixed on Terra, you cannot even see your boots.’ ‘I do not play these word games.’ Augusta snorted. ‘You are a heretic, and I am done speaking with you.’ The people were chanting now, rhythmic and soft. It sounded almost like the Sisters’ battle litany, but the words had been warped, twisted. That we wouldst bring them only death… That we wouldst spare none… The villagers began to move forwards again, their eyes afire, their hands outstretched. They passed Subul and spread outwards into the chamber. Augusta stepped back, allowing her squad their field of fire. ‘Then gun them down,’ Subul said, as they surrounded and concealed him. ‘They are weaponless, defenceless. Gun them down and fulfil your warlike cravings!’ ‘You cannot assail my faith,’ Augusta said. ‘They are heretics. I shall not suffer their lives.’ Behind her, five bolters cocked ready with a noise that rang from the rock. The people of the town died. Despite Subul’s taunting, Augusta had no doubts – the people had followed falsehood, and their lives were forfeit so that their souls might still be saved. They had no hope facing the Sisters’ weapons, and they fell and they bled and they died, and their lives leaked slowly into the filling pool. As the bolters finally silenced, as Caia and Melia walked among the dead, Augusta found herself staring at the floor. The blood was soaking into stone, spreading out through the rock by some strange osmosis, some chemical effect that she did not fully understand. Soaked into the stone, Jatoya had said. The truth of your Order’s history… An odd, cold chill went down her back – something she was missing, something else that was happening here… Not just the daemon, something more. Akemi, her armour spattered in blood and her bolter still smoking, said, ‘He made us take the daemon’s lives for it.’ She was beside Augusta, staring at the now-full pool, and her voice contained the first hints of anger, new and jagged. ‘He made us feed it.’ ‘These people, Akemi,’ Augusta told her, ‘have been saved twice. They walk in the Light.’ Akemi looked around at the destruction, the twisted spread of death that the Sisters had wrought. ‘I understand that,’ she said. ‘But I… I dislike being a game piece.’ ‘Hold to your anger, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘It a gift from the Emperor and it brings you courage, and resolve. But…’ she paused, holding Akemi’s gaze through her visor, ‘…control it. Never let it master you.’ The vox crackled as the responding channel opened, but before Akemi could voice her answer, Augusta heard something else. Something moving. Something big. The vox-channel closed again as all six women stopped to listen. The corruption was moving, out there in the tunnels. It felt like power, like cruelty, like hunger, like anger. It seemed to pulse through the very stone. ‘I cannot see Subul,’ Jatoya commented. Augusta looked round at her second-in-command. ‘We must find him.’ ‘He is not among the dead,’ Melia said. ‘He must have used the people to cover his escape. Though where he was going…’ ‘Can we not follow him?’ Augusta asked. ‘I suspect he will lead us to the heart of this complex.’ The truth of your Order’s history… Do you not know where you are? What had he meant? But she dismissed the thought – she had no time for speculation. Akemi was right, somewhere, the hounds’ masters were gathering power, sucking in the blood and the souls that had been shed within their auspice. As if it had heard her, the sound came again – deep laughter, mocking and rich and hot. It came with a flare of pure greed, a craving sense of fury and appetite that made the sweat slide down Augusta’s back. We are the same, you and I – soaked in the blood of innocents… Viola raised the heavy bolter. She indicated the far side of the chamber, and the doorway that Caia was now scanning with the auspex. ‘We can follow him,’ Caia said. ‘If we move swiftly, and he stays within our range.’ ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Let us not release him from our sight.’ Viola stood up, heavy bolter reloaded and ready to take point, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘No, Sister,’ she said. ‘Walk rearguard and ensure nothing is following us. Jatoya, take point.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad’s second-in-command came forward to take Viola’s place, and Viola moved as ordered – but Augusta did not miss the resentful flash in the younger woman’s bright green eyes. They headed further into the maze. Here, the walls of the tunnels were studded with skulls in the manner of an ossuary, bleached-white bones in elaborate patterns, streaked with blackened and ancient blood. In places, the angled and leering spirits of the Age of Strife were etched into the stone, their obsidian and mica covered with long-congealed gore. The Sisters’ suitlights moved across the patterns of the dead. Between the bones, silent archways opened in every direction, caked with the rust-coloured moss. Behind them, endless corridors led away into the darkness. The Sisters had no idea where they were. Augusta found herself fighting for breath, fighting the sensation that the weight of the rock above her was pressing, down, down upon her shoulders, that she would falter and fall, and the darkness would rise to swallow them as it had done upon Hephaestus. Beside her, Melia had stopped. She was leaning against the wall, trying to reload her already loaded bolter. Augusta put a hand on her arm. ‘Stop. The weapon is ready. It holds the faith of our Order and its own strength. Remember to pray, Melia, the Litany of Truth. It will clear your mind of the darkness.’ Melia said, her voice shaking, ‘Ego veritatem tuam.’ ‘We must go on. Cleanse the core of this place.’ Do you not know where you are? A curl of fear was growing in Augusta’s heart. She knew that they should check every tunnel, that they should ensure their exit route, and not leave the possibility of enemies at their backs. But she also knew that they could not let Subul get too far ahead of them. And her instinct told her to head down, always down, that the thing they sought lurked somewhere in the catacombs’ bowels. And that they needed to reach it before Subul assaulted them again, and its power grew. At last they came through the final skull-framed archway and turned down a wider, stone tunnel that was precarious with its sharp descent. Here, the moss was even thicker. It made their footing soft and slippery, and it filled the air with spores that seemed to hover like insects. It also interfered with their preysight, and further confused the auspex in Caia’s hand. But still, they headed steadily down. Side exits became smaller and more uneven, and many led upwards, back towards the light; tiny rooms offered stone beds that indicated cells, these ones empty of devices. At some point, people had lived down here. But those people were long gone – now, there was only the darkness. And the more they progressed, the more Augusta could feel it, that hot, close pressure that seemed to condense in her chest, making her breathing thick and heavy. She began to recite the Litany of Mettle, feeling the others steady as she did so. They moved on, Jatoya’s quiet strength at their head. As they advanced, the hot wind became stronger, blowing in their faces from something ahead of them. From the place, Augusta was sure, where the daemon would be manifest. But when they reached the end of the tunnel, even the Sister Superior stopped to draw in a breath. The tunnel opened out onto a walkway, a flat and narrow span of stone that crossed a chamber like some vast and bottomless pit. Jatoya had paused in the cover of the tunnel-mouth – her flamer was a shorter-range weapon and of little use unless they were attacked upon the bridge. Augusta came forwards to look out over the drop. Beside the bridge and stretching down into the darkness were eight titanic, carved figures, hundreds of yards tall. They bore masks with gruesome, tooth-filled grins, carried blades or great whips in iron and brass and volcanic stone. And at their feet, somewhere far below, there was the faintest glimmer of flame. Augusta’s certainty was absolute – the Emperor had guided them. This was exactly where they were meant to be. ‘We will find a way down,’ Augusta said. ‘Caia?’ ‘Subul has turned away from the main passage, and is still ahead of us.’ She indicated the last of the side-tunnels, a maw into darkness. ‘If we want to keep him in range, we’ll need to follow him, and swiftly.’ ‘There is corruption below us,’ Augusta said. ‘I can hear it, feel it. We must face it.’ ‘Is the bridge secure?’ Jatoya asked. ‘The density of the stone is unchanging, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘The bridge is secure.’ ‘Good,’ she said. ‘Sister Superior – what is your decision? Do we pursue Subul, or do we cross?’ Augusta came to the very edge of the tunnel and looked out over the drop, her belly lurching. The floor was too far to see, but the flashes of firelight were unmistakeable. ‘We cross by twos,’ she said. ‘Jatoya, Caia, you first, and secure the far side. The rest of you, watch and give covering fire. If anything moves, shoot it.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. She paused to eye the open expanse of the bridge. ‘On the double, Sister Caia. Ready?’ The two women timed themselves the count of three and then ran, tiny red figures in the expanse of the chamber, their black and white cloaks snapping behind them as they raced across. Caia slipped and Jatoya paused to steady her companion, but they reached the far side without mishap. ‘Melia, Akemi.’ Two more red figures ran. At the rear, Augusta glanced at Viola. She had left them until the last deliberately, and now she put her hand on the younger woman’s shoulder. Over a private vox-channel, she said, ‘Steady, Viola. You are strong, and you’ve come a long way from the young woman who shot the ork warlord.’ Viola said only, ‘Aye.’ She seemed to think about it for a moment, then added, ‘I wish this were that simple.’ Augusta chuckled, the sound one of long years of battle experience. ‘One thing the God-Emperor teaches,’ she said, ‘is that no two fights, no two foes, are ever the same. Trust in His wisdom and remain strong.’ Viola nodded, looked as though she was about to say something further, but a cry across the vox made them both look up and across the chasm. ‘Sister!’ The voice was Jatoya. ‘You need to bear witness!’ Augusta gave Viola’s shoulder a brief, tight grip, then let her go. And they ran. Augusta was not wild about heights. She wasn’t afraid of them, exactly, but they made her queasy to the pit of her stomach – of all the tests of her faith, drop-pod missions were about her least favoured. But, as ever, she pushed the nausea aside – she could not indulge such things. As she ran, though, she was still painfully aware that they had no cover, and that if anything shot at them, there would be nothing they could do – even if a bullet did not penetrate their armour, the impact would be enough to make them fall. Down, down into the depths… They reached the far side safely. As they crossed once more into the security of the surrounding stone, Caia was there to meet them, her injured arm cradled to her, her breathing harsh. ‘We found the others.’ Her voice caught. ‘But Felicity…’ The weight of the sentence was enough. Augusta pushed past her and into the last room, the final room of the complex that was not the lurking pit below. ‘By the Light!’ Dropping to her knees, she touched the front of her armour, her heart in her mouth. Another mockery, another taunt. In here lay the remains of Sister Felicity’s squad – ­shattered armour, rotting and dismembered limbs. They had been arranged in a pattern, deliberate, some ghoulish mockery or design, and five flayed skulls sat in a pile in the centre, all of them covered in blood. Five. Not six. Felicity herself was still missing. Viola had stayed by the exit and was still watching the bridge. The rest of the squad joined the Sister Superior, kneeling to the members of their Order, now lost to the darkness. ‘Blessed be their memories.’ They stayed like that for a long moment, repeating the prayer. Then Melia pulled a small candle from her kit and placed it upon the floor, lighting it with a prayer of her own. ‘We will not let this pass,’ Melia said. She, too, was beginning to sound angry. ‘We will finish this.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta told her. ‘We will. And then we will place the monster’s head upon the altar of the cathedral itself.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT Akemi knew it was there – she could feel it. Like the choking density of the town’s air, she could feel the presence of Chaos, feel it whispering in the back of her mind. It knew they were coming; it wanted them. It hungered for their company and for the blood-games that would follow. And they would scream before it was over. The thought of it pulled her breath from her lungs. Sister Akemi had never doubted the change in her calling, the shift from her novitiate classes in scriptology and linguistics to the lessons of bolter and blade. It had been a matter of faith, and unquestioned. But this was her first real mission, the first time she had ever left the quiet security of the Convent Sanctorum for longer than her Trials of Ordination. And here she was, descending the last of the circling stone steps to the very bottom of the pit – the dark hole in Lautis’ heart. She was a warrior of the Order, and she knew she should not be afraid. But she could not help it. ‘Tenebris,’ Augusta said softly. The Sisters’ suitlights went out. In the sudden plunge of darkness, the walls offered a familiar glow. The same eerie green gleam that had lined the town lurked also down here, jagged patterns that glittered like veins, calling them onwards. Akemi felt the shift in angle that was the bottom of the steps. And a voice in the blackness spoke to them. ‘Ah, my Sisters. So at last you have come.’ With a boom like the command of a general, it said, ‘Let there be light.’ A rush of flame flared round the walls. The protections in her visor prevented her from blinking, but Akemi took a step back, almost unable to stop herself from crying out. Now, conjured to hot and flickering life, a huge firepit occupied the centre of the floor. It was piled high with skulls, the ones at the top recent, the last of their flesh now burning, the ones at the bottom so old that they were all but dust. Brass spikes ran around its outside, all pointing inwards and downwards – anything that was cast into that hole would have no way to escape. The thought of it made her shudder. But that was only the beginning. Around it, the bases of the eight stone statues stood like monstrous pillars, their dancing shadows cast upon the walls behind. Before them, sconces stood in the stone, all of them bright with a rich, blood-red fire. And everywhere, the carvings ran with the blood from the pool above, the red seeping into the green. The ancient figures seemed to glint with hunger and glee. But even that was not what made Akemi stop. Before the pit itself stood three creatures, each one horned and scarlet-skinned. Their legs were back-bent, their arms heavily muscled, ending in outstretched hands and the talons of a predator. They made her heart shake in her chest – the fire and blood-walls limned them in power, in a slavering rage of cruelty. They reminded her strangely of the hounds, and she did not need Augusta to tell her that these were their masters, the leaders of their hunt. Each one carried a blade that shone with the same, unholy glare. Like a splinter of Chaos itself. The voice said, ‘Welcome, Augusta. Your martial reputation precedes you – you are a true warrior of your Order.’ Its laugh rolled from the walls. ‘Now,’ it said. ‘Show me.’ Long tongues extending, the things licked their teeth. ‘Move!’ Augusta barked the order. ‘On the double. Let’s give ourselves some range, an open field of fire. We don’t want these things close!’ Skidding, her hand gripping her bolter and her boots going from under her, Akemi ran. Somewhere, something in her heart wanted to just keep running – to flee this place, flee this horror. Flee the writhing, shimmering colours of these creatures’ eyes and swords… Confidunt in Eo, Akemi. She believed. Augusta was still shouting. ‘That statue – that one – put it at our backs!’ But behind them, the creatures, too, had broken into a run. They were faster than Akemi had expected; they covered the ground so quickly that she barely had time to reach the statue, then turn to raise both bolter and litany like the twin flags of her faith. But the incoming creatures didn’t care – they slowed down and bared their teeth at the Sisters, as if sneering. The squad fired and wounds appeared in the beasts’ chests and shoulders, mists of blood and steam pouring from their skin. They did not stop. They came on like a promise – like they would tear the Sisters’ hearts out and cast their skulls into the pit. In response, Augusta’s shout came over the vox. ‘Viola! Fire!’ ‘From the begetting of daemons!’ With a shout of defiance, Viola loosed the full power of the thrice-blessed heavy bolter. The creatures juddered under the full suppression; they shook and they staggered, but that was all. Furious, Viola kept firing, kept singing the litany so the words, too, would drive the creatures back. One took a round in the leg, blowing it apart. It faltered and fell, hissing at them, daring them to go closer. ‘Leave it,’ Augusta barked. ‘Viola, concentrate your fire, one target at a time. The one on the left!’ ‘But, Sister! I can kill–!’ ‘Follow the order!’ Flinching at Augusta’s tone, Viola switched targets, letting the left-hand creature take the full force of the weapon. The things were getting close now, and Akemi wanted desperately to quail away from them. She could feel the tension in her throat rising – she wanted to scream to release the pressure. She kept singing. Augusta shouted, ‘The rest of you, take out the injured one!’ Gunfire and harmonies rang from the rock. Akemi resumed shooting, trying to hit the injured creature’s weak points – its joints, its eyes. Beside her, Caia shot with her uninjured hand, holding her auspex in the other. The wound in her elbow was swollen, and the auspex flickered and flared. She cursed the thing, slung it back on her belt, and concentrated fully on the bolter. But the closest creature was almost on them now. Eyes burning brighter than the fire, it raised the blade as if to cut them down. Panicked, Akemi felt a powerful urge to switch targets, to shoot it before it could reach them, but she knew she had to follow her orders, focus… With a rasp, Augusta started her chainsword and stepped out to meet it. Over the vox, the litany came from her in a low, angry rumble – like a threat of incoming thunder. Akemi had admired Augusta’s steel resolve, her unwavering faith, her utter fearlessness – but this… to stand blade to blade against this creature of Ruin, against such ferocity and rage… The creature paused. It splayed its talons and bared its teeth; its tongue curled and rolled. The sword in its hand glowed like red hell; as Augusta brought her own blade up to cut the thing open from hip to shoulder, it parried, and hard. Sparks sizzled on the stone. ‘Akemi!’ The command was Jatoya, and it made Akemi jump. She raised her pistol once more. Beside her, Viola had the heavy bolter braced against her shoulder. Her target creature was moving through a mist of its own blood, still taking round after round – it had slowed under the onslaught, but that was all. And Viola’s anger was as high as Augusta’s, raging completely and without limit. The litany roared from her, and Akemi could feel it – the surge of it in her heart and her soul, the pure zeal of the Sisters’ rage. She found herself joining the shout, both furious and praising, as if daring the fear to come back. She shot, and shot again. The injured creature snarled at her. Struggling to stand, it looked up and met her eyes. And then, suddenly, she couldn’t see – only the darkness, only the brass hooks, embedded in her skin, only the seething writhe of Chaos. She cried out, unable to help it – her shouts torn down like a dropped banner. The flash was too strong, overwhelming– Jatoya’s gauntlet struck the side of her face – not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to make her jump. ‘Your orders were to keep firing!’ ‘Aye!’ She aimed her bolter at the thing’s other knee and pulled the trigger. She saw the round strike its flesh – blow the back of the joint clean out of its leg. It stumbled further and spat in pain; a drool of saliva ran from its teeth. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Akemi found the litany coming from her mouth in celebration, now, in harmony to the thundering rage of her Sisters. Facing the daemon, her courage and anger were annealing, fusing suddenly into something new and bright. It felt like a forging of her faith into a new weapon, a new light. She was a Sister of the Bloody Rose, a follower of Saint Mina, a Daughter of the Emperor, and this was why she’d been called. Beside her, Viola was still shouting, still shooting; smoke was starting to come from the heavy bolter. But Viola’s aim was good; she dropped into a kneel, leaned back, braced the weapon against her shoulder… Akemi saw the weapon start to overheat, saw the rounds hit the thing clean in the face. And she saw the daemon finally waver – too much damage, too many wounds. It staggered to its knees, then toppled, twisting in the air in the same way that the hounds had done, becoming a spiral of detonating blackness. And then it was gone, and the red mist was all that was left. Smooth and swift, Viola turned the smoking bolter on Akemi’s injured creature and blew its head clean from its shoulders. Another detonation, and it, too, was gone. Akemi wanted to raise a prayer of thanks, or relief – but the fight was not over. There were still two struggling figures, silhouettes against the firepit. To one side of them, the last of the creatures was circling the Sister Superior, swift and light on its feet, and grinning through razor-sharp teeth. As Akemi watched, Augusta spun her blade one-handed and struck at it, once, twice. And each time, the creature’s blood-shining sword parried the blow with a harsh, metallic crash. The chainsword scraped and grated. Sparks flew. Over the vox, Jatoya said, ‘Remember Hephaestus?’ Puzzled, Akemi glanced at the others. No one moved. Only Jatoya. As Augusta shifted, forcing the daemon to turn to face her and expose its back to the Sisters, the second-in-command dropped one shoulder and broke into a run. She hit the creature full-on. It tried to keep its feet, failed. And as it hit the floor, Augusta stepped forwards and took its head straight off its shoulders. The resulting detonation covered both women in gore – but it, too, had gone. The chamber was silent. Nothing moved. Only the running teeth of the chainsword. Only the dancing crackle of the flames. And then, the voice began to laugh. Rich and deep and dark, the laughter came from all around them. Akemi could not see the owner of the sound, but she realised that the creatures they’d faced were just more minions. There was something else down here. Something bigger. ‘Impressive,’ said a voice. ‘A display like that is almost worthy of a Champion of Khorne.’ ‘Coward!’ Augusta shouted the word to the stone. ‘Come out and face me yourself!’ The laughter twisted, the sound harsh and unpleasant – whatever it was, she’d made it angry. It snarled, its voice now layered with many tones. ‘Stay your tongue, wench. I’ll deal with you soon enough.’ Muttering over the vox, Jatoya commented bleakly, ‘Wench, is it? I’ll pull out its lungs and make it eat them.’ Augusta made no comment. Instead, she shouted, ‘I’ve cut down your hounds, creature, your bloodletters, your cultists. What else can you bring me?’ ‘Very well.’ It sounded amused. ‘I think you’ve earned your boon.’ With a rumble, the wall before them came down. Akemi was on the floor, scrabbling frantically away, her mind shrieking something that might have been a prayer. The thing filled her vision, her head, her thoughts. It choked her with the reek of blood and death; it kicked its way through the rubble as if the rock were nothing but sand, and it paused on the far side of the fire. She had understood that these beasts existed, but had never believed, never even begun to imagine, what that could actually mean. The thing was almost as tall as the chamber, its matted and filthy fur clad in brass that flashed in the firelight. Great wings framed it in darkness and power. In one hand, it bore an axe, the notched blade longer than Akemi was tall. In the other, it bore a huge, brass-spiked whip. It lashed the thongs around its head, the harsh noise snapping from the walls. Akemi was dimly aware that the rest of the squad had fallen back, that the hymnal had faded from the air. Her mind screamed only terror and absolute, utter incomprehension. And then she heard a voice. Augusta’s voice. ‘Et Imperatoris nomen, non vereor vobis.’ In the Emperor’s name, I do not fear you. Her tiny, armoured figure silhouetted by the monster, the Sister Superior had stood her ground. Unflinching, she took up the hymnal once more, her words cold and strong. They came over the vox like a blessing, and Akemi realised that she’d fallen. Ashamed of herself, she scrabbled upright, her bolter still in her hand. Other voices were joining the recitation, now; she raised her own, striving to remember her electric rush of faith from before. But the monster only laughed at them. The noise seemed to come from all around it, from out of the very rock. ‘Are you Mina, little girl? I think not. Greater warriors than you have faced this death, Augusta,’ the voice said. ‘Greater swordswomen than you have failed. They faltered, and they fell, and they begged for their lives.’ It hissed at her, mocking. ‘And they were drained, blood and soul, and their skulls cast upon the flames. And now, Augusta Santorus, you think yourself the equal of your betters? You will die screaming.’ Beside Akemi, Viola was still on her knees. She was reciting the hymnal like a woman demented, the same words, over and over and over. She seemed to be fiddling with something held across her lap. As Akemi leaned to see, she saw that she was reloading the heavy bolter with shaking gauntlets. Jatoya had moved to stand at Augusta’s shoulder, another silhouette against the enormity and the flame. Caia and Melia were further away, but back on their feet. They faced the thing together, weapons in hands. The daemon took a step forwards, and the whole chamber shook. It leaned down, teeth bared, its spread horns almost as wide as the firepit, and said, ‘Look at you, Augusta. At your bloodlust, at your fury, at your red armour all soaked in gore. Are you not just like us, Sister Superior? Are you, too, not a creature of warfare and death?’ She said, her voice flat, ‘I fight by the Will of the Emperor, and by His command–’ It laughed again, blasphemous and scornful. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ Still reciting the hymnal, Augusta didn’t move. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death…’ The creature exhaled, a hiss of spittle and flame. ‘You still do not understand, little one. Did you not come here seeking truth? Seeking artefacts and icons? The building above us, that you so revere, was indeed raised in the name of your Saint. It is her statues that you have seen. It has shed blood in her name. Blood, to punish the heretic, blood to convert the unbeliever, blood for those who failed your Emperor, blood for those who did not bend their knee quite fast enough…’ ‘That Thou shouldst spare none…’ ‘But she did not build it, Augusta, nor did her followers.’ It paused, almost grinning. ‘We did. We have used her name to further the ancient powers of this place – we have made sure that every sacrifice made in the Emperor’s name fed us, kept us, strengthened us. That every act made in the name of your Saint has been what you would term a “blasphemy”. And for thousands of years.’ It was celebrating now, exultant in rage and power. ‘We hold a vial of Mina’s own blood here, taken from her last stand upon Hydraphur. That is the artefact that you first came here seeking. Do you want it?’ ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none…’ ‘We are the same, you and I. Linked by blood. Celebrate your skills, Augusta. Rejoice in them! Set yourself free from the bondage of your foolish faith!’ ‘We beseech Thee…’ ‘Stubborn as ever.’ The daemon sneered, scornful and angry. ‘…Destroy them.’ ‘So be it,’ the creature said. It raised the whip. Listening to the daemon, Akemi had realised something else. It had taken her a moment – in the first shock of terror, she had not known what was happening, but now her mind was back at the schola. She could see her old tutor, the text on the data-slate; she was scrambling after old information, after a half-forgotten novitiate class, so many years before. She faced the daemon, trying not to blink, watching its mouth as it spoke… Or didn’t. Its teeth were as long as chainswords, but that was not what she was looking for. She was having the oddest sensation that the daemon itself was not speaking. That its voice was coming from somewhere else. She found herself scrabbling to remember – something. There was a piece of information that she needed, that she knew she had… …but the daemon was filling her head. Akemi clung to the words of the hymnal, and tried to clear her thoughts. The whip coiled and snapped again, the sound sharp and harsh. Remember, I must remember… Emperor, help me, help me clear my mind… She was staring at the symbol on the beast’s armour, the symbol of the Blood God, the same one that had been engraved in the skin of Subul’s forehead… Augusta said, quite clearly, ‘…destroy them.’ ‘So be it.’ The beast stood upright, its bass laughter thundering like a rockfall. But yes, Akemi realised, she had been right – it was not the beast that was laughing. Its huge fangs were bared, but the laughter was not coming out of its mouth– And then, the memory hit her like the long ruler of her one-time novitiate tutor… ‘Sister!’ She shouted out loud and over the vox, desperate to make Augusta hear her. ‘Sister! I think… I think we may have a chance!’",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Watching the monster, Augusta listened to Akemi’s frantic outline, her memory of her lesson from the schola. The Sister Superior had faced daemons before, and she knew the truth of what Akemi was saying. ‘Sister Akemi, you are truly blessed with wisdom.’ Augusta inhaled, made her decision, gave her orders, soft and urgent. ‘Go. Take the others with you. Find him. Jatoya, stay with me.’ ‘I would not be anywhere else,’ Jatoya said. The touch of her second’s strength and friendship was powerful, a touch of faith in the clamouring dark. She heard the others scrabble as they crossed the cavern floor. The colossal might of the daemon laughed ever harder. ‘So you flee, little Sisters? So much for your devotion.’ ‘We have devotion, daemon!’ The voice was Viola’s. A flash of pure adrenaline shot through Augusta’s nerves. ‘Viola.’ Her words over the vox were swift and quiet. ‘Follow your orders.’ She didn’t turn, couldn’t take her attention from the titanic, looming height of the monster, but she could still hear the bootsteps as the younger Sister walked across the floor of the cavern. ‘I am a Daughter of the Emperor,’ Viola called. ‘A Sister of the Bloody Rose. A follower of Saint Mina. And I do not fear you, daemon, any more than I fear orks, or any other denizen of the darkness! I defy you!’ Her voice was shaking with outrage – but Augusta could hear the truth of it. Viola’s boldness was pure swagger; under the pressure of the daemon’s presence, she had a need to prove herself worthy, to live up to the thrice-blessed weapon that she bore. ‘And I will send you back!’ ‘Viola!’ The Sister Superior’s bark was stronger, this time. ‘Follow your orders!’ But Viola did not reply – she may even have turned off her vox. She came forwards into Augusta’s peripheral vision, an upright figure in blood-soaked scarlet, her cloak blackened by flames, her single merit-bead flickering in the firelight. The heavy bolter was raised, nestled against her shoulder. ‘Child,’ the daemon said. Its voice was soaked in scorn. ‘I will peel every inch of skin from your body.’ ‘Try it,’ Jatoya muttered. Whether it heard her or not, it raised the whip, curling its thongs upwards and over its head. Augusta knew that one lash from that weapon would break Viola in half, armour and all. But as it came down, Jatoya was already moving. Akemi scrambled across the floor of the cavern, away from the monster and the firelight and towards the bottom of the staircase. Words tumbled from her as she ran. ‘Subul,’ she said. ‘We need to find him. And fast.’ The others followed her as ordered, their confusion not voiced aloud. She replied to it anyway. ‘Think about it,’ she said. ‘There has been so much bloodshed here, and for thousands of years – from the Age of Strife, and in the cathedral’s valetudinarium… Sister Jatoya was right – the blood-worship is soaked into the very stone here.’ ‘What about the town?’ Caia asked. ‘They embraced the Emperor, welcomed the return to their faith of the Great Crusade…’ ‘Many embraced the Emperor, certainly,’ Melia said. ‘But the darkness has always been here, twisting and lying and deceiving. This whole world is a battleground.’ ‘Then we will win that battle,’ Caia said, simply. ‘Once and for all.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Kawa tried to fight,’ Akemi said, still thinking aloud. ‘Maybe Subul used her death as a summoning ritual, maybe the summoning itself was accidental – just too much bloodshed – I don’t know. But…’ she paused, turned round, ‘Subul bears the mark of Khorne, and if we can find him…’ ‘We will banish the daemon?’ ‘We will banish the daemon.’ Caia had her flickering auspex in her hand and was trying to understand the endless tangles of tunnels, the erratic distant blips of motion. They raced back up the long curve of the steps to the last side passage, and the direction that Subul had taken. But Caia shook her head. ‘The signal’s gone. This place is like a nightmare. How do we find him in all this?’ Akemi controlled her rising impatience, resisted the urge to grab the auspex and look for herself. Then Melia pointed, ‘There.’ On the stone ahead of them: a tiny smear of red. ‘Quietly, Sisters,’ she said. ‘Let us take this carefully and not let him know we’re coming.’ Akemi wanted to point out that they didn’t have time to spare – but she also didn’t want to doubt the strength and faith of the Sisters now below them. Then Caia suddenly said, ‘Where’s Viola?’ The crack of the whip sent a sharp detonation through the air. The stone shook. Augusta did not move. She saw Jatoya slam Viola clean in the belly, taking the younger Sister off her feet. The whip curled over Viola’s head just as the pair of them hit the ground. They rolled back upright in seconds. In defiance of her orders, Viola was again raising the bolter. Augusta would discipline her squad member later. Now, she bellowed, ‘To me, both of you!’ Both Sisters started to move, but the descending clang of the axeblade was too close, and it sent them sprawling. Snarling, the daemon raised the weapon just enough to crush both of them where they lay– ‘Wait!’ Augusta stepped forwards, bellowing up at the thing. ‘You’ll face me, daemon, not them.’ ‘What are you doing?’ Jatoya asked. The squad’s second was pulling Viola to her feet, but the younger Sister was struggling to rise. She was chanting the same line of the litany, over and over again. From the begetting of daemons… the begetting of daemons… Augusta said, ‘Giving Akemi time.’ The daemon hissed through long, stained teeth. ‘Why? I could kill all of you with a flick, with a finger. I could hold you over the fire and flay you while you still lived.’ Because the error of this place was mine, and they should not pay for it… ‘You don’t fear me, do you?’ Her shout rang from the stone, mocking. ‘Do you fear to lose?’ Caught, the thing mantled its wings and hissed, stooping forwards to study her. Its head was bigger than she was, its eyes like pits of fire and death. As it came close, Augusta felt her throat close, her blood turn utterly cold. The screaming… The blood… The hooks… But she could also see a red Sabbat-pattern helmet, bloodied skull still within, that was hung about its neck like a trophy. It was the one that had been missing from the previous chamber. Felicity. And her anger came flooding back to her, her faith and her strength. ‘A morte perpetua. Domine, libra nos.’ The monster snarled. ‘You foolish women are all the same.’ Its breath was caustic, polluted. ‘So proud, so eager to die.’ ‘I will take you with me.’ That made it laugh again, a deep rumble like falling stone. It stood back upright and threw back its head… …but now, Augusta could see that Akemi had been right – the voice did not belong to the creature. ‘Your Sister said exactly the same thing,’ it said, but the words were posturing, empty. And hope unfurled like a flag in her chest. Three scarlet figures slunk along the edge of the wall. They had no need for the auspex; they could hear the movement, now, hear the voices from ahead of them. Hear the many-layered bass boom that was Subul, the summoner. Akemi was beginning to understand that the daemon had always been here, that the blood shed down through the generations had called it back to the stone, again and again. And she could remember the stylised illustration in the schola’s manuscript – the cult leader with his symbol, his arms raised. They needed to find and slay him, and end this ordeal. Then they could return to the cathedral, and to the town, and they could begin their work anew. Or raze the building completely. The three Sisters turned the last corner of the tunnel. Ahead of them, there was light. It was the same rich, red light that came from the fire below – as if the flames themselves were somehow thick with blood. It had all come from here. The chamber was bright with flame – it had an open viewing port that allowed its occupants to see down into the pit. Down there, Augusta would face the daemon and she would try to give Akemi enough time… But Subul was not alone. One of the smaller creatures stood with him, flanking him like a guard, its hooves tamping restlessly on the rough stone floor. About its ankles curled another three of the red-skinned hounds. And Subul himself. He stood before an angled metal machine – a smaller thing, but a thing that looked exactly like the dead sculptures of the town. This one, however, was very much alive – and it defied her vision, its corners impossible, its edges bright with a hot, brass gleam. Writing writhed about it, seething in the air, and it contained an outline like some ancient mirror, a thing that roiled with mists of scarlet. It did not reflect the room, nor the figures within. Not a construction device, as Jencir had first guessed, but a portal. In its presence, Caia’s auspex flickered, guttered and burst into flame. With a startled curse, she dropped it. At the sound, the summoner turned around, the vortex in the mirror haloing him in pure, Chaotic power. Subul’s grin was unchanged, and the symbol on his head still ran scarlet with his own blood. The flow had blinded him completely, but his sightlessness was not a hindrance and he laughed the bass laugh of the daemon. ‘Ah,’ he said. ‘You are wise indeed, little Sisters.’ The hounds curled at his feet, bristling and snarling. ‘But you are not nearly strong enough. I can call forth endless foes, an army to walk over your corpses and to own this planet entire. And when your canoness comes – which she will – I can take her shuttles, and her ships. I can access the moon, and the fuel that it bears. And then, I can be freed from this rock.’ ‘So that’s it,’ Melia said. ‘You want the warships.’ ‘Your Mechanicus are easy bait, and your Order both warlike and prideful. You are simple to lead, and simple to slay. And this will be your ending, once and for all.’ His grin broadened, wider than his face. ‘Fitting, that Mina’s Order should make its last stand here, facing its oldest foes. And I… I will be free to leave. To carry the power of the Blood God across the galaxy!’ Melia made no response. She raised her bolter and pulled the trigger. But Subul was no longer there. Somehow, he’d slipped sideways and the round hit the flaming, churning, seething mass that was the centre of the mirror. The daemon hissed as if it were laughing. And the hounds leapt forwards. Down her long years of combat, there were many times that Augusta had been thankful for the care and attention she gave her armour, for the faith and training and discipline that kept her wargear immaculate. As the impossibly huge axeblade crashed to the floor just beside where she’d been standing, this was one of those times. The armour would not have stopped the blow, but it moved fluidly despite its weight, and it allowed her to dodge and roll. She came to her feet, blade still in hand, the Litany of Battle rumbling in her throat like a growl. But, defiance aside, she also had a solidly practical understanding of the might of the daemon – if that axe hit her, she would not get up again. And she had to give Akemi time. Facing the thing, she fought to banish its darkness from her mind, seeking a weak point, an advantage. She had better reactions, more manoeuvrability – yet its words had caught her, like a hook in her skin. Like your whole blood-armoured Order… This beast had slain Felicity. Dismembered her squad. Peeled the skin from Jencir’s skull and soaked the high altar in his life. In her head, she could hear the tech-priest, screaming like the Hephaestian miners… Snarling denial, she roared, ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ The whip-thongs circled and snapped over its head, the noise of them deafening. Brass spikes sparked with flame. But as the baffles in her vox-bead kicked in, she became aware of Jatoya’s deep voice, urgent words in her ear. She softened the litany to a whisper, fierce and quiet. ‘His hand has guided us, Sister. He has shown us the way.’ ‘What do you intend?’ Augusta said. ‘Quickly!’ She threw herself backwards as the whip snapped at her again, an inch from her gorget. The detonation of it almost made her stumble. ‘Viola!’ Jatoya barked the order. The roaring bark of the heavy bolter was familiar, a relief. Viola couldn’t take the monster down, but she could slow it, keep it back. The daemon juddered under the impacts. It paused, mouth open, hissing in frustration. ‘Are you such a weakling, Sister? Tumbling and fleeing?’ Augusta ignored the goad, kept moving. ‘The statue!’ Jatoya said. ‘You must observe this for yourself!’ The bolter hammered, flashes of rounds impacting from the daemon and from the surrounding stone. The creature was closer now. It raised a foot, stamping at the Sisters as Augusta had once stamped at the gretchin in the cathedral above, then slashed the axe at them, snarling. Fire flashed from the blade. Seeing it coming, Jatoya moved, but she was not fast enough; the edge of it caught her full in the chest, lifted her from the floor and slammed her back into the wall. The crunch of ceramite was unmistakeable, like the cry in the vox that was suddenly cut short. She slid to the floor, broken. ‘Jatoya!’ Viola was shouting, raw and wild. But the crumple of armour lay still. Wrath rose in Augusta’s heart – the sort of anger that burned from her skin, her weapons, her voice. She drew the chainsword, started the mechanism. She may not be able to kill this thing, but she was a Sister of Battle, a Daughter of the Emperor, and Jatoya was her second and her friend. The creature peered downwards. ‘You foolish little woman.’ The words were an accusation, a goad. ‘You think you can fight me?’ Augusta tightened her grip on the chainsword and the litany rose in her heart like the bells of the convent itself. But revenge was personal, prideful, and a sin. She was the faith and fist of the Imperial Creed – she fought in the name of the Emperor, not in her own. This thing was daemon and defiler, and she must stop it with whatever means she could muster… She had a mission to complete. She cast her gaze around and saw what Jatoya’s plan had been. In one of the colossal statues, the huge pillars of carved stone that stretched all the way to the roof of the chamber, there was a crack. A long crack, a fault-line that split the thing almost to the top. And in it, she had placed a krak grenade. The falling rock may well kill all of them, but it would slow the monster enough. ‘Truly,’ Augusta whispered softly, ‘you are blessed with wit as well as weaponry.’ Then, over the vox: ‘Akemi,’ she said, ‘how much time do you need?’ But it was Melia who replied, ‘Sister! We are under attack!’ There were only the three of them – no heavy bolter, no flamer, no chainsword. Subul stood with the impossible brass mirror behind him, its roil and seethe surrounding his flesh with the raw, hot churn of Chaos. They could hear the daemon, its voice interwoven with Subul’s, mocking Augusta for her cowardice; they could feel their own rage, but they were focused upon the advancing hounds. Shoulders low and bellies slinking, the beasts approached the three women, savage and eager. Melia’s orders were calm, clear. ‘Short, focused bursts. And sing, my Sisters, for the Emperor is with us!’ The hounds’ daemon master snarled the order to attack. Three bolters barked; one of the beasts twisted and faded, its essence sucked back towards the portal. But two were still moving and their master came with them, blade shining red in the light. ‘Again!’ Melia’s order was unnecessary; a split-second later, the bolters barked a second time. But the beasts were close now, too close. Akemi heard the conversation in the pit, the words in the vox. She heard Jatoya’s cry. Then one of the things was upon her, leaping for her throat. She went backwards, grappling for its collar. The daemon driving them was snarling and hissing in a language that made chills chase along her skin. And the beast was right in her face, yammering at her. Its teeth were bared and its breath was making her visor steam over; she couldn’t see, couldn’t think, couldn’t move. Panic rose in her heart. She heard Caia swear, heard Melia bark another order but the creature was right there and the words were lost in the chaos… Chaos. Another flash of memory: her brief studies of the Ruinous Powers, in the schola, all of them strictly supervised. She had opened the scrolls and read the words and felt her flesh crawling in response. But the memory was gone again, lost under the weight of the thing, under the horror of it so close and the smog of its breath in her visor. It stank like sulphur; its jaws were either side of her gorget, and she could feel it, straining to bite down. She remembered the litany, the words rising almost reflexively. Her frantic hands found the thing’s collar and dragged it away from her face. It scrabbled, claws scraping on ceramite with a noise that set her teeth on edge. She gripped it in one hand, brought the bolter up in the other. With its bared teeth no more than a smoky smear, she put the bolter against its skull, and pulled the trigger. Red splattered, blinding her completely. The creature’s weight was gone. She came up to her feet, shaking, her gauntlet scraping the blood from her face. In the chamber, only one of the creatures was still upright, coiling at its master’s hooved feet. The blood­letter had raised its blade and was facing the three of them. The glow of the portal shone from its eyes. Akemi felt Caia and Melia as they pulled together, felt the strong bond of her Sisters. Subul, furious, was roaring, his many-layered voice half-chant, half-outrage. The colours at the centre of the mirror had changed hue; they were fierce and bright, rich with the tones of brass and blood. And there were noises coming from it now, echoes of screams and warfare, of clashing weapons and gunfire, of massive, rumbling engines. Instinctively, Akemi knew that there were more of the creatures coming. And then more, and then more. They would never end; the portal would spew them forth in their thousands. ‘We have to stop him!’ She raised her bolter, unaware she’d said the words aloud. Subul’s chant grew higher. And then, with a thunderous roar, the whole chamber shook. The detonation knocked Augusta from her feet. Above her, the statue trembled, tottered and fell. One side slid clear, a cascade of heavy stone that hit the daemon’s shoulders and rocked it on its hooves; the other side stayed upright for a moment, then followed it down. It went over sideways in a single piece that struck the thing an immense, heavy blow. The daemon faltered, stumbled. Its axe hit the floor with a crash. But even as it was getting up again, reaching for the weapon, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Target its hands!’ The heavy bolter roared, its full rate of fire aimed at the monster’s whip-hand. It wasn’t enough – even under the repeated impacts of the heavy bolter, the daemon seemed to shrug off the damage. It came back to its feet, rocks sliding from it; it reached to pick up the axe. Its anger was tangible, now; it filled the air. The steam that poured from its shoulders was thick, ropes of it rising to the roof of the cavern, boiling like the jungle’s mist. Teeth bared, it roared at them, inarticulate and furious. The hate was like a fist in the face, a punch in the gut – only the bright flame of Augusta’s faith was keeping her on her feet. ‘I do not fear you,’ she told it. ‘In the Emperor’s name, we finish this.’ The concussion had knocked the bloodletter from its feet. It was scrambling back upright even as the detonation faded, but it was not fast enough. Melia was after it in a moment, kicking its blade away from its hand, finishing the last hound with a single, accurate shot. Behind her, Caia placed one boot on the daemon’s chest. Even as Akemi was gathering her wits, Caia snarled a war-prayer, and shot the thing in the face. Gore splashed; the creature snarled and struggled. But Caia kept firing, and kept firing, one round after another, again and again, her voice rising to a paean that was almost a shriek. The thing finally detonated and she stumbled forwards, falling to her knees. She stopped, her shoulders shaking, blood leaking down her injured arm. But Akemi had turned to Subul, and to the mirror. The summoner was snarling his chant, his face distorted. The symbol on his head pulsed with blood and light; its red glare lit the walls. He was savage, furious, and the daemon’s roars were echoing out of his mouth. Steam was starting to steal across the roof of the chamber, but it was too late. Subul may have the voice of the daemon, but he was only a man. Only a heretic, who had dared to risk his soul for the false powers of Chaos. ‘I do not fear you.’ Akemi repeated Augusta’s words. ‘In the Emperor’s name, we finish this.’ She aimed her bolter at the symbol on his forehead, and pulled the trigger.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN The daemon exploded with a horrific, echoing howl. The sound shook the cavern; rubble rumbled from the toppled statue. Then: silence. Viola loosed a battle cry, raising her voice in a hymn of thanks. Augusta felt relief unfurling in her soul, the release from the stink and rage and pressure of the daemon’s presence. For a moment, she felt almost weightless. Truly, the Emperor had blessed them. But the mission was not yet over. Walking to where Jatoya had fallen, she said, ‘Sister Akemi?’ Akemi’s voice came back over the vox. ‘Praise the Emperor, Sister. Subul is dead. The gate is closed.’ ‘Be sure.’ At the base of the wall, the heap of red armour was crushed, cracked and splintered by the strike of the axe. ‘Oh, we’re sure.’ The voice was Caia’s, her tone dark and lethal. ‘We have placed grenades, ready to collapse the machinery. If we can.’ ‘You and Akemi hold that location,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Melia, I need you here.’ Carefully, she turned Jatoya’s helm to check the life signal. ‘Sister?’ Viola joined her, her voice filled with concern. Augusta stood back, breathing hard. It took a moment before she could speak, and when she did her words were heavy and soft. ‘She walks at His feet. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘No.’ Viola’s breath caught on a sob – a sound that was as much exhaustion as grief. ‘Blessed be… blessed be her memory.’ ‘This place is accursed,’ Augusta said. ‘Too many Sisters have laid down their lives.’ She watched the crumpled form for a minute, then said, ‘Sister Viola.’ Viola raised her chin. ‘Sister Superior.’ ‘You disobeyed my order, Viola.’ Her words were flat, somehow empty of all feeling; suddenly, she felt very tired. ‘When commanded to leave with the rest of the squad, you stayed to face the daemon. I do not need to remind you of the schola’s most basic lessons – that we must all rely upon the unity, courage and the trustworthiness of our Sisters. An order disobeyed can spell death for a squad in the field.’ Viola flinched, looking at the broken armour beside them. ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Not only that, but you acted out of a purely personal need – a need to prove yourself. You did not act for the good of the unit, nor for your love of the Emperor. Do you have anything to say to me, Sister?’ Viola paused. She inhaled, as if searching for the right words, then her shoulders sagged once more. ‘No, Sister. I wanted–’ ‘What you “wanted” is irrelevant. Your need for personal merit overcame both your training and your orders.’ Viola said, her voice quiet, ‘Sister, you could not have held back the daemon without me, and without the heavy bolter. I disobeyed the order because I feared for the failure of the mission.’ She paused, then said, ‘I will accept whatever discipline you feel is necessary.’ The Sister Superior drew in a breath. Jatoya’s death had not been Viola’s doing, but still, a splinter of anger was caught in Augusta’s heart. With an effort, she mastered it. ‘Disobeying a direct order should see you among the Repentia,’ she said. ‘Or at the very least your badge of merit removed.’ ‘Yes, Sister. I understand.’ Augusta considered her. The young woman’s head was bowed and her attitude contrite. Her lone adamantium bead glinted – the award she had received for the death of the ork warlord. ‘I feel, Sister Viola,’ Augusta said, ‘that you were unready for your field promotion, and you have been daunted by the expectation that it has laid upon your shoulders.’ Viola looked up, her expression wary. ‘Yet you have faced your task with courage and you have learned to use the weapon with great speed, great skill and great accuracy.’ Viola watched her, still unspeaking. ‘We will undertake suitable atonement,’ the Sister Superior said, her decision reached. ‘We will retrieve our fallen Sisters. We will carry them back to the township where we will raise a pyre to Sister Jatoya, to Sister Felicity and her squad, to the tech-priest Jencir and the missionary Lyconides, and to Kawa Koumu and the bravery of her warriors. We will cleanse both the cathedral and the shrines of the town, and we will grant a final blessing to those who have attained the Emperor’s side.’ ‘Sister?’ Viola’s tone was surprised. ‘You–?’ ‘I must accept responsibility for my decisions,’ Augusta said. ‘I made the choice to promote you to Sister Kimura’s role. And by my failure was Chaos loosed within this place.’ She glanced at the smoking daemon flesh strewn across the floor, at the last of the skulls in the firepit. ‘This planet has seen me err too many times – the blame for all of these deaths is mine. And may the Emperor accept my penitence.’ In the thick night of the Lautis jungle, the flames burned high. Behind them, the twin guards of the ziggurat flickered in the light, and its stepped, dark shape angled upwards into the sky. At its peak, the ancient depiction of the Emperor looked out across the empty town. Watching the hot, bright fire that consumed the figure within, Augusta had removed both helmet and gauntlets. The night air was heavy and warm, but its comparative freshness was welcome. She looked around the gathered squad, all of them bare-headed and weary. Their armour was scratched and dented, their cloaks stained and filthy – but she was proud of every one of them. Even Viola, despite her insubordination. ‘I have transmitted the report,’ she told them. ‘And there are enough supplies within the basecamp to sustain us until the Tukril arrives from Mars, the Kyrus with it. Our mission, Sisters,’ she tried to stop the bitterness in her tone, ‘has been a success.’ ‘How long will we be here?’ Melia asked. ‘Sixty-five days.’ Her response was met with a dismayed silence – she knew full well that her squad did not wish to stay here, never mind for two Solar months. But she was not finished. ‘But be warned – we are not on hiatus, Sisters, and we must maintain our guard. Where Chaos has manifested, it may yet still return – and it is up to us to ensure that the cathedral and its tunnels remain free from any taint. The patrol work may be tedious, but it is as much a part of our calling as the banishment of the beast itself.’ She paused, but her squad still said nothing. They only stood listening to the brief. ‘And we must not err.’ Beside her in the firelight, Akemi said, ‘What of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Sister? With the Tukril returning…’ She let the query tail off into silence, but Augusta understood. The daemon had said that they were easy to lure, implying that Jencir had known of the machinery, and had come to Lautis not to rebuild, but for reasons of his own. The curiosity of the Adeptus Mechanicus, as Jatoya had commented, was often their undoing. ‘We will greet them upon their arrival and discover the parameters of their mission. I await the orders of the ­canoness – it may well be that the cathedral and the town will be destroyed. Certainly, it would be the most secure outcome.’ On the far side of the fire, Viola stared down into the flame, her armour gleaming. She had been very quiet on their careful retreat from the cathedral’s undertunnels, retrieving Jatoya and the gruesome remains of the fallen squad and obeying every command without question. And there had been no further sign of her outspoken bluster. At Augusta’s words, she glanced up. ‘Permission to ask a question, Sister?’ ‘Of course,’ Augusta said. ‘Why is it that the Adeptus Mechanicus have such a tie to our Order?’ Akemi, standing at the fireside and flicking her little fetish between her fingers, glanced up as if eager to answer, but Augusta said, ‘You know the legend of Saint Mina, Viola. It was the very first doctrine you studied when you joined this Order.’ Viola nodded, ‘Yes, Sister.’ Augusta said, ‘Saint Mina was martyred upon the Mechanicus planet of Hydraphur. She was slain at a small shrine and her body was drained of all blood. Yet still, her blade slew hundreds of her foes.’ ‘Then perhaps Jencir’s curiosity was not just the machinery,’ Viola commented. ‘Perhaps,’ Augusta said. ‘The Mechanicus have been political supporters of our Order for many centuries.’ She let herself smile. ‘If Akemi can read enough of his notes, we may even find out.’ Akemi made a face. ‘But – what about the vial?’ Melia said. ‘The daemon Subul mentioned a vial of Mina’s blood. Do we believe that such an artefact really exists?’ ‘Subul was playing games,’ Augusta said. ‘Games of words. He was taunting and provoking us and trying to make us falter.’ Her smile was grim. ‘In drawing a comparison between ourselves and the bloodlust of the followers of Khorne, he was calling everything we are into question, the entire history of our Order. But we have faced his mockery, Sisters. We have faced the minion of Chaos, faced blood and fire and death. And while we may know rage and warfare and the pure anger of the Emperor’s wrath, there remains a difference between our desire for battle and theirs.’ The others watched her; her gaze stopped on Sister Viola. ‘We fight in the Emperor’s name,’ Viola said. ‘We have purpose.’ ‘Just so,’ Augusta agreed with her. ‘And we fight with control. We embrace the rage, but we use it wisely. It never commands us. And that, above all things, is why our discipline matters.’ Viola flushed, understanding all too well the point that Augusta was making. ‘As to the vial,’ the Sister Superior said. ‘Daemons are the masters of deceit. We cannot know if such a thing exists.’ ‘But,’ Melia said, ‘in the days to come, we will have time. We can search for it while we patrol.’ Caia said, ‘I will find it.’ ‘I don’t doubt it,’ Melia told her. From somewhere, a cawing cry split the darkness, and made them jump. Akemi said, ‘The wildlife of the jungle – it’s coming back.’ Caia looked ruefully at her broken auspex. ‘I suppose we had better set a watch.’ ‘I will watch,’ Augusta told them. ‘And I will pray. Take the rest, my Sisters, you’ve earned it.’ She moved away from the firelight to find a vantage. As her weary squad settled to watch the flame, she stood like the warriors of the ziggurat, silent and on guard. Watching the Sister Superior leave the firelight, Sister Akemi flicked her little fetish between her fingers. She had survived. She had faced her fears, faced the powers of darkness. She had spilled blood and taken lives, and seen the slavering maw of Chaos itself. She had felt the pure rage of her calling, the rise of defiance, exhilaration and courage that was the signature of her Order. And she had understood why it was different. She flicked the little silver icon, watching the light on the metal. It was precious to her – the symbol of the Order of the Quill. She had always kept it with her, despite her change of calling. The cawing rose again, now further away. Sister Akemi flicked the item one last time, and leaned forward to place it, carefully, in the flames. She had no regrets as to the decision she had made, and she needed the item no longer.",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE The broken steel gantry swayed and screeched. Backed to its outermost end, the wounded man had stumbled to his knees. Alone, unarmed, he held one hand to the smoking hole in his belly. The other supported him as he crashed forwards, coughing blood. He did not have long. ‘Aim!’ The sergeant’s bark was curt. It rang hollow, echoing loudly in the empty systems of pipes and conduits that towered around them, resonant in rust and decay. Nine lasguns tucked into nine shoulders. Nine tiny, red insects clustered on the man’s skull. The man made no move; he didn’t protest, or try to defend himself. He’d led them a long chase, but it was over. ‘Hold your fire.’ A woman’s voice, cool and controlled. The sergeant raised one hand from his weapon, and the squad paused. A small, grey-robed figure stepped through them, her black boots ringing on the metal walkway. Even in her ceramite armour, she was barely as high as the heavy sergeant’s shoulder, but her poise and bearing spoke of complete authority. Her head was bare and her white-threaded dark hair was braided tightly down her back. At her feet, an empty vat-tank stretched downwards into darkness. It had a mark stamped in its side – the cog-and-skull of Triplex Phall, and a line of Mechanicus numerals, noting its denomination. Somewhere at its base, there hissed the wash and seethe of liquid. But the woman did not look down. She said, ‘It’s over, Zale.’ The man did not respond. He was still coughing; his breath was harsh and ragged. Like the metal-stinking wind, it rose into the umber sky, and was gone. ‘Ma’am?’ The sergeant stood poised, his battered green armour-plates filthy with blown rust, his head still tilted into the rifle sight. She could feel his tension, his need to end this, once and for all. The squad’s lieutenant had already died on his knees – from the beginning, this entire mission had been littered with corpses – but such things were of little interest to her. She took a further step forwards, her gauntleted fist closing. The band of her signet ring bit into her flesh. She would take whatever action she deemed necessary. Curtly, she repeated the order. ‘I said, hold your fire.’ ‘Ma’am.’ The sergeant was a good man, solid. She felt his pressure on the trigger ease. Satisfied, she raised her voice, let her accusation sound like a paean from the crumbling pipework. ‘Scafidis Zale, you are a heretic and a traitor, and there is nowhere left for you to run. You will surrender, or you will fall to the waters below, and there you will dissolve. You will beg me for pity as they eat your living flesh, but there will be no pity, Zale, not for you. Repent here, and I may yet grant you your future, and your continued service to the God-Emperor.’ From somewhere, far out in the mess of refineries, machines and galleries, there came the sounds of shouting, and running boots. There was the hiss and boom of lasgun fire, a rise of laughter, the noise of fists on flesh. But she and the fallen man were intent only on each other. Slowly, the injured Zale sank backwards until he was sitting on his heels. His hand was still on his belly, his head bowed. The woman felt the sergeant tense. Rage and suspicion rose from his burly shoulders. Still, she did not give the order. She said, ‘Surrender, Zale.’ Feet sounded again, closer this time. Several of the soldiers twitched, but the noises soon clanged past them, and faded to echoes. And then, at the far end of the gantry, Scafidis Zale began to unfold. Slowly, he came to his feet. He moved like a performer, taking command of his stage. Nine points of light followed the motion. He didn’t care. Instead, he said one word, like a hiss of pure scorn… ‘Inquisitor.’ And he started to laugh. Lycheate. Once a forge world, a world of industry. Lycheate was a planet of refineries and manufactoria, of ferrous incinerators, of furnaces and vents, of the pulse and vein of living machinery. Once, Lycheate had thundered and rumbled with the fusion reactor deep at its core. It had been governed by its fabricator, and teeming with tech-priests, transmechanics, lexmechanics and enginseers. Once, Lycheate had been orbited by dozens of small moons, each one rich with promethium and rare ores, drilled with mines and worked by helots. Shuttles and cargo scows had ferried those ores to the planet’s surface, where they’d been assayed and smelted and forged, and then shipped out across the Imperium, the lifeblood of all mankind. Once. But Lycheate’s moons had long since been stripped bare. Its steelworks were empty, its forge-temples abandoned to the seething swarms of human and xenos scum that had moved in there. The planet had become a vacuum – a sucking, steel-walled cesspit that pulled in the lost, the heretic, the mutant, the cultist… All those who wanted to vanish, or who had nowhere else to go. Inquisitor Istrix, however, had no interest in the denizens of this place. She had walked fearless through their filth, untouched and uncaring – this world was a sewer, worthy only of Exterminatus. And that would come. For now, Istrix had a greater purpose. The inquisitor was focused purely on her quarry. She had hunted him, relentless, all the way from Terra itself, all through Scintilla and the mines on Sophano Prime, and finally out here, to the very edges of the Ultima Segmentum and the Calixis Sector. Now, she had him. And, as the wounded man came to his feet, his laughter ringing like the sounding of ancient hammers, Istrix gave thanks to the Emperor Himself that her long chase was over at last. ‘Inquisitor,’ he said. ‘Zale.’ Tiny, framed by the lost wealth of rust and decay, Istrix faced her foe. ‘There’s nowhere left to hide.’ But his laughter only grew. Ever the entertainer, he flicked his fingers. Screaming, the sergeant went over backwards, his lasrifle firing bursts of superheat at the pipework over their heads. Metal creaked and screamed and tore; debris plummeted past them, clattering and banging against the sides of the tank, splashing into the waters below. The sergeant had both hands clutched to his helmet; as he hit the walkway, he started to thrash, his feet hammering. The noise was incredible. Beside him, the lance-corporal turned on her fellows. Stepping back to use the lasrifle, too fast for anyone to react, she carved red light through three of her comrades, then turned the weapon on herself. Her last, mad laugh was cut off as the front of her helmet vanished in a hiss of steaming gore. She toppled over the edge, and was gone. No fool, the corporal barked an order. Five streaks of scarlet whooshed out at the figure on the gantry. But Zale was up, now. He was uninjured, and moving. Moving fast. Still laughing, he gave another, extravagant gesture. With a roar, forge fires boomed to sudden life; the rise of heat was staggering, blistering. Swearing, the corporal threw up his arms and fell back. The air shimmered and stank – fuel and fear and fumes. In the blur of it, Zale wavered and was gone. But Inquisitor Istrix did not move. She watched, impassive, as her grey robes ignited, as the scarred and grubby armour of the Astra Militarum began to char and smoke. Several of them were swearing, emptying water bottles or trying to smother the flames with their gloved hands. She could hear the corporal barking further orders, his nerve remarkably steady. Again, lasgun fire streaked across the air. She barked, ‘Hold your fire!’ The corporal echoed her order. The lasguns stilled. She heard one of them mutter, her voice confused, ‘Corp?’ The words were across the squad’s private channel, but Istrix could hear them quite clearly in her vox-bead. The man responded, his deep voice low, ‘You heard the inquisitor. Hold your fire.’ With a faint, cold smile, she took another step out onto the gantry, now swinging wildly from its overhead wires. The metal squealed in protest; it was already reddening to a dull, magma glow. Her burning robes billowed in the rising heat. +Issy.+ Zale’s laughter crawled into her ears, echoed through her skull. It took her brain apart, piece by piece; it touched old memories, the days of his training, now long-gone… She could hear him in her head. +You don’t have to do this.+ But he could not touch her; she belonged to the Emperor alone. He was a traitor, a failure – her failure. And he would surrender himself to Penitence. That, or lose his soul. She commanded the corporal to hold his position; walked three more steps out along the gantry. The roasting, searing heat clawed up at her from far below; the fall was hungry for her life. Her flapping robes burned higher; there was smoke in her eyes, her face. She felt her braid crisp and shrivel, burning like fuse wire; felt her skin start to soften. Felt the holes opening in her flesh. But she tightened her fist, feeling the signet ring. There was no heat, no flame. No forge. The pain was nothing. She said, ‘Your trickeries do not touch me, witch. The Emperor is with me.’ At the end of the walkway, his gold eyes now blazing with the lava-light of the glowing metal, his whole form rippling with power and illusion, Zale offered her a bow. Still laughing, he raised his hands, gestured again, tore a huge rent across the pipework to one side. Steam flooded out at her, hissing, then rose towards the brown and distant sky. Somewhere up there, debris shone like the stars. ‘I can tear out your heart,’ he told her softly, ‘and you know it.’ ‘This is nothing,’ she said. ‘Witchery. Illusion. The machine-spirits of this world are long dead.’ But Zale laughed like a daemon, his eyes still burning. Behind her, she heard a sudden, physical struggle, heard the corporal curse. Boots rang on the walkway, there was shouting, then a long, wailing cry as a second figure went over the edge. She did not bother to turn. ‘Mistress.’ The word was a caress. ‘You never learn. How many lives will you throw away? How many more will you send to the Emperor’s glory, before you see the truth? I will not surrender to the torture you call Penitence.’ ‘No more,’ Istrix said. ‘This is over.’ The awful heat yammered at her, searing her now-hairless scalp, hurting her lungs as she breathed it in. But she was stronger than this, better than this. ‘Then shoot me,’ he said to her softly. ‘If you can.’ She raised the bolter. And, with an ear-splitting screech, the gantry fell away beneath both of them. From its orbit of the jungle-planet Lautis, the Imperial frigate Kyrus had turned back to the vacuum of space. Called home by the astropaths, by the tides of the empyrean, it was returning to Ophelia VII, and to the Hallowed Spire of the Convent Sanctorum. Behind the heaviness of the Kyrus’ reinforced bulkheads, securely defended by its void shields and gunnery decks, there lay an empty, decorous hollow, like a hole in its heart. Floored with rockcrete flags, walled with glassaic windows, each one lit by a cunning strip of exterior biolume, this was the ship’s chapel, silent and chill. Neat lines of pews could seat almost a tenth of the Kyrus’ full crew; rows of faces, each man and woman looking up at the altar, and at the broad banner of the aquila that hung above. To one side of that central image hung the winged skull of the Imperial Navy, to the other, the twisting-fish symbol of the Kyrus herself. Flanked by the imagery, lit by the ever-shining glow of the electro-candles, stood the golden stone statue of the God-Emperor. Thirty feet at His Imperial shoulder and framed by the aquila’s wings, He stared out over the nave, His gaze clear, His expression stern. He demanded service. He accepted no compromise. He reminded every one of them of their faith, their courage, their sworn duty. And, from those rows of pews, the crew of the Kyrus could look upon Him, and leave this place uplifted, ready to carry His name out through the warp and to all corners of the Imperium. They would fight and die for Him, to the last man and woman. And they would do so gladly. Now, however, the pews were empty. Under the false vault of the rockcrete roof, the cherubim circled silently, their cold, augmetic gazes eyeing the space below. As the heavy hatchway clunked open, they blinked metal eyelids, recording every movement. A lone figure stepped through. It paused, silent. Bright in the chapel’s lume, its scarlet armour glittered, all ceramite and plasteel. Over this, it bore a black-and-white cloak, decorated with the symbol of the rose; the fabric billowed as it turned to close the hatch. A line of adamantine beads decorated its chaplet and, at its hips, there were slung a Godwyn De’az pattern bolter and a brutal, heavy-duty chainsword. Its – her – head was bare, revealing a stern bob of steel-grey hair and a distinctive tattoo. She said, though there were only the cherubim to hear, ‘In the name of Mina and the Golden Throne, I am the willing daughter of the God-Emperor. I come to listen, and to do His bidding.’ Sister Superior Augusta Santorus touched the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and bowed her head. The cherubim blinked again, their eyelids clicking. As if by their signal, servitors whirred from their resting places. Augusta lifted the bolter from her belt, unclipped the sword, and laid both in the offered brass trays. The soldiers of the Imperial Navy had no requirement to lay down their sidearms, but she, as outlined in the Accords of Deacis VI, entered His presence with humility – bare of weapons, and with her head bared to His light. Slowly, she walked up the aisle. But she did not look up. Since their departure from Lautis, Augusta had visited the chapel often. Not just offering the daily prayers of herself and her squad – and those soldiers of the Navy who’d wished to attend – but at other times, when the hollow was quiet, and she could focus her concentration. Augusta was the commander of her squad, a veteran ­warrior of twenty years’ experience. She had fought battles against xenos, daemon and heretic; she had pursued the foes of mankind to the very edges of space, and she had slain them all. But there was a darkness upon her heart that would not leave her, and that had brought her, once again, into His presence. It defied her comprehension – their previous mission had been a success. Upon Lautis, they had faced a greater daemon, and had banished it back to the warp. They had freed the jungle-planet from the daemon’s cultist followers, and had secured the ruined cathedral for their Order, the Order of the Bloody Rose. The Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priests and servitors arriving aboard the Tukril now held the building safely, and were beginning its reconstruction. The Kyrus had accompanied them, and had waited to assure their security. And now, the old frigate was taking the Sisters back home. Her boots loud in the chapel’s silence, Augusta reached the altar rail. The cherubim followed her movements, sharply watchful. She knelt, her grey bob of hair falling forwards over her face. Though they had defeated it, the Lautis daemon had left her with nightmares. It had infected her thoughts, plagued her dreams with Chaos and Ruin, with images both fearful and bloody. For long Solar weeks after its expulsion, she and the other members of her squad had awoken sweating, and had knelt in midnight prayer… Fortitudo est certa clara meo. My strength must be unfailing, my sight clear. Augusta did not fear the spewed-forth creatures of the warp. Yet Lautis had seen the deaths of two members of her squad – Sister Kimura, in the battle against the orks, and Sister Jatoya, her second and right arm, smashed by the daemon’s axe. Her lips moved in prayer: the Litany of Divine Guidance. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. In twenty long years of battle, Augusta had lost troops before. Her Sisters had been slain, but they had died with courage and honour and they stood now at His feet… Levis est mihi. Show me to the Light. …but her darkness did not diminish. She recalled the words of the cultist’s leader, Subul, the man who had summoned the daemon. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ For a moment, she dared raise her eyes to Him, framed by the light of the electro-candles… But it was too much. His expression was too austere, His judgement too stern. She was His daughter, her faith and weapons unquestioned, unquestionable; war was her craft and her study. Anger, grief – these were permitted, within proper confines. The loss of her discipline was not. Shamed, she lowered her gaze, back to the gleam of her armour, blood-red against the rockcrete floor. Whatever mission called them, it was His will, and they would praise His name, with hymn and blade and bolter, just as they had always done. We are strong, she told herself. We will not fail. Yet, as she completed her litany and came back to her feet, she wondered at the shadow that still lurked so deep, and at what it may mean for the future.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO The dull throb of the Kyrus’ engines rumbled like a vast heartbeat. It resounded through the metalwork, through the twisting guts and veins of the old ship; as the Sisters prowled forwards, suit-lights glimmering, they could feel it in their boots and their blood. They moved cautiously through the empty corridors, alert for any motion or threat. It was dark down here, and the air was bitterly cold. Over the vox, Sister Melia Kaliyan growled orders. ‘We will progress as far as the junction. Akemi, with me. Viola, Caia, standard skirmishing advance. Maintain your vigilance, Sisters, we do not know what lurks here.’ Bolter in hand, the smallest of the red-armoured figures fell back to Melia’s position, bilgewater sloshing at her ankles. Melia paused to check the squad’s spacing, then used the preysight in her retinal lenses to search for signs of heat, for enemies hiding silently in conduit or crawlspace. But there was nothing. ‘Caia?’ ‘Auspex is clear, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘No motion, no life signs. Even the rats have cleared out.’ Viola muttered, ‘There’ll be something.’ Melia commented softly, ‘Quiet, Sisters. Focus. We have until Compline to complete this mission and return to the Sister Superior.’ ‘Aye.’ The ship’s lumens flickered and fizzed; in front of them, one light sputtered and then died completely, leaving a pool of darkness upon the rippling water. Two of the red-armoured figures moved forwards through it, their skirmish tactics flawless – each one ran ten paces and then splashed down to one knee, covering her comrade as she ran forwards in her turn. Melia watched them, assessing their movements. At the request of the Sister Superior, the captain had cleared his helots and servitors away from this lower deck, but Melia knew, just as Viola did, that there was something waiting for them. Something… She said, ‘Situation report.’ ‘Clear both ways, Sister.’ Viola, her thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands, had taken cover at the right-hand corner of the wall. ‘No motion, no hostiles.’ ‘Caia?’ Covering the junction in the other direction, her auspex bathing her visor in a garish, green light, Caia said, ‘Not as much as a blip. We’re the only things down here.’ ‘Take a full five-second awareness check.’ Melia’s hand tightened on her flamer. ‘There are spaces behind these walls, Sisters, they could be concealing any number of threats – xenos, stowaways, saboteurs.’ Sub-vocal, she counted it down: three, two, one… ‘Very well, we’ll head onwards. Akemi, move up. I’ll take the rear.’ In the vox, Akemi replied, ‘Aye.’ Smoothly, the foremost Sisters moved out to secure the junction. Akemi splashed after them, then ducked back to a kneel as they continued to move. Melia walked at the rear, the filth-strewn water tugging at her feet, her flamer guarding the corridor behind them. She checked over their heads for ladders and walkways, for lurking creatures, for hatches left unsealed… Nothing. Her skin crawled – it couldn’t be this simple. She had to be missing something. But what? ‘Objective sighted,’ Caia’s voice sounded in the vox. ‘Two hundred yards.’ Melia barked, ‘Hold.’ Glancing back over her shoulder, Sister Melia could see it clearly: the glimmer of the pict-screen at the corridor’s far end. But she did not give the order to advance. She said, ‘Eyes open, Sisters.’ More wary than ever, expecting the ambush at any moment, she checked the flickering lights, the overhang of the servitors’ walkway, the line of small, round airlocks that led out to the saviour pods… Still: nothing. What was she missing? The weight of Melia’s new responsibilities sat as unfamiliar to her as the flamer in her hand… Jatoya’s were big boots to fill. The Emperor has called you, she told herself firmly, for the hundredth time. You will offer only thanks for this opportunity to serve Him. Her tone in the vox was firm. ‘Full scan.’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Caia said, again. ‘The corridor’s clear.’ Viola echoed her, ‘Nothing.’ ‘Very well,’ Melia said. ‘We proceed, but slowly. Follow the left-hand wall, Sisters, under line of sight from the walkway. I want every pod-hatch checked.’ ‘Aye.’ Their movements polished, Caia and Viola took the left-hand turn. They headed onwards, and stopped by the first hatch. But Sister Akemi, the youngest of the squad and newly blooded upon Lautis, paused. ‘Akemi?’ Melia’s voice was soft in the vox. Akemi said, ‘There’s something here.’ Instantly Melia barked, ‘Hold!’ Caia and Viola stopped dead. The auspex gleamed green, but its screen remained still. ‘Still nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Not as much as a bilge-rat.’ Viola, both hands on the heavy bolter, twitched a frost-edged pauldron in a shrug. Slowly, Melia turned around, her feet sloshing, her skin crawling with tension. She searched the walls, the hatches, the walkway, the corridors both ahead and behind – the living, twisting guts of the frigate… What was it? What had she not seen? Then Akemi pointed, ‘There!’ ‘Throne!’ The exclamation was out before Melia could stop it. ‘Again?’ And there it was, like a slap to an untrained novice: opposite the nearest hatch, hidden behind a conduit-cover, there was the empty case of a melta bomb. It was almost invisible, painted black, and mag-fastened to the wall. Upon it was inscribed, in Augusta’s stern, cursive hand… ‘BOOM’. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ Melia cursed again, lost her combat stance and slammed the flamer back onto her hip. ‘How did we miss it that time?’ ‘We’re well within the blast radius,’ Akemi commented, ruefully. ‘Motion sensor, triggered as Viola passed – that would have killed all of us.’ ‘Scenario failed.’ Caia’s tone was annoyed, though her ire seemed aimed at herself. She shook the auspex, glaring. Melia let out her breath, frustrated. ‘All right, Sisters, exercise over. Regroup at my location. We’ll put together the report, and join the Sister Superior in the chapel.’ Her armour creaking, Viola came back to her feet, turned around. ‘I went straight past it,’ she said, coming to look at the black metal case. ‘I didn’t even see the thing.’ She glanced at Akemi. ‘How did you know?’ Akemi had plucked the case from the wall mounting and was turning it over. On the bottom, in the same hand, it carried the number four. It was the second one they’d missed. ‘The Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has a pattern. I don’t know if it’s deliberate, but she ambushes us in very similar locations, every time. It’s always at a tension-point, a place where we’re thinking about something else – concentrating on a junction, maybe, on an objective, or on hatches in the wall…’ She tailed off. ‘I think it’s deliberate, and I think it’s a part of her lesson – we’re not down here just to identify a threat.’ ‘Everything has a pattern,’ Caia agreed. ‘Every type of xenos and heretic adheres to its own rules – we just need to know them so we can anticipate. They taught it to us at the schola,’ she turned to Melia. ‘Do you remember? Old Garvia used to say–’ ‘“All things have an Operandus”,’ Melia finished. She took off her helmet, revealing dusky skin and a dark bob of hair, both now glittering with sweat. Her warm breath steamed. ‘“Know it, and your foe’s defeat is assured”.’ She held out her hand for the hollow bomb casing, then crushed it in her armoured fingers. ‘All right, Sisters, we’ll put together the analysis. What we got wrong, and how we can – yes, lieutenant?’ Her tone was startled; the others turned around. Behind them, standing framed by the junction’s jittering lights, a young naval officer stood waiting for their attention. He looked out of place, all the way down here – his uniform was immaculate, and the sludge from the floor was starting to creep up his trouser legs. As Melia turned, however, he gave a perfect fist-to-chest salute. ‘Sisters. I apologise for interrupting your training, but the captain has requested your presence with the utmost urgency, and he does not wish to put this over the vox.’ Surprise flickered through the squad. The others, too, had started to remove their helmets and gazes flashed from Sister to Sister, though they said nothing. ‘For what purpose?’ Melia asked, her tone careful. Looking pained, the young man said, ‘The captain… is in receipt of new orders, Sisters. He needs to relay them personally.’ Viola’s eyebrows shot upwards; Akemi frowned. Melia said, ‘Lieutenant, the captain’s orders came direct from the canon­ess of our Order, from Elvorix Ianthe herself. We’re to return to the Convent Sanctorum.’ ‘Yes, Sister, the captain is aware of this.’ The officer stood bolt-upright, but sounded increasingly apologetic. ‘But those orders have changed.’ He met Melia’s dark gaze, his eyes slightly wide. ‘You’re… wanted by the Inquisition.’ ‘We’re what?’ Pulled from the chapel by a pale-faced aide, Sister Superior Augusta filled the captain’s office with scarlet shoulders and tightly controlled rage. Her expression a thundercloud, she said, ‘Captain Mulier, I trust you’re not accusing my squad…?’ ‘No, Sister, of course not.’ The captain was an older man, with a truly spectacular set of whiskers. Defended by his gold epaulettes and by the heavy weight of his desk, he leaned back, refusing to be intimidated. Beside him, his servo-skull ­hovered silently, its red gaze glittering. ‘A poor choice of words, perhaps.’ He held Augusta’s iron-grey gaze for a moment, then said, ‘Sister Superior. At seventeen hundred hours, Solar time, the Kyrus was in receipt of a ­communication. And that communication was a demand – for our mission parameters, our cargo, and for the full roster of the forces that we carry.’ Augusta continued to glower. ‘That information is surely classified.’ ‘Of course,’ the captain said. ‘But the demand came with an Inquisition signature. And when your name was mentioned, the inquisitor immediately commandeered your presence. She has a mission that… necessitates your assistance.’ ‘Captain.’ Augusta’s voice held the faintest edge. ‘I am under orders from my canoness.’ But the captain was not backing down. ‘Sister,’ he said. ‘We are – you are – under orders from the Inquisition.’ Caught, she said nothing – an inquisitor had the rank to command any force or cooperation they required, including the obedience of a planetary governor, or of the Adeptus Astartes. And, captain or no, it would not be proper to show an emotional reaction to a member of the Imperial Navy. She allowed herself the luxury of rattling her gauntleted fingers on the butt of her bolter. ‘Did she detail the mission, captain?’ ‘She did not.’ The man was still looking up at her, his whiskers bristling. ‘She merely issued the command. We’ve been given new coordinates, Sister – we’re adjusting our plasma drives now.’ His words made her notice the change in the ship’s engines, the ever-present throb intensifying as the million-ton weight of the Kyrus turned with slow dignity, like some vast creature. Augusta said, ‘Our new destination?’ ‘Sister–’ A sharp, metallic knock interrupted his answer. He raised his voice. ‘Enter!’ A young officer pushed the hatch open, and immediately stepped back to allow four more armoured figures into the room – Augusta’s squad, helmets off and weapons slung. Melia caught her gaze, and gave her a brief nod – their training had been completed – then came to stand at her side, feet apart, hands behind her back, helmet mag-locked to her hip. The other three stopped a pace back, their stances identical. Their frost-rimed armour still radiated the chill of the lower decks; the small room was suddenly filled with the glitter of ceramite. Each purity seal caught the lumens and gleamed like a statement of faith, each merit-bead like one of accomplishment. And each face was perfectly schooled, both stern and proficient. Sister Melia Kaliyan, now second-in-command. Augusta had been unsure about Melia’s confidence in her new role, but Melia had faced the challenge with no visible doubt in either herself or her abilities. Sister Caia de Musa, Melia’s closest friend through the schola. Tall and bronze-haired, her auspex always to hand, her gaze was razor-sharp, and she missed little. Sister Viola Taenaris, freckled and red-haired, with a noted streak of wilfulness. Her insubordination upon Lautis had cost Viola her single merit-bead – only the extremity of the situation had prevented her from making the trip back in the Kyrus’ brig. And Sister Akemi Hirari, the squad’s newest and youngest, her skin pale and her hair shining black. Akemi had almost taken her vows to the Order of the Quill, and her lore surpassed that of all her Sisters combined. Upon their previous mission, it had been Akemi’s insight that had enabled them to banish the daemon. Looking at them, Augusta felt her heart lift, felt it flush with faith and light. She gave them an approving nod and turned back to the desk, offering silent thanks to the Emperor Himself for her squad’s solidity. Her darkness was nothing, and it shamed her. Shamed them. ‘Sisters, thank you for attending.’ Respectfully, the captain came to his feet, his gaze travelling from one face to the next. ‘I understand that your training was not to be interrupted, but the situation is critical. Dismissed, lieutenant.’ The young officer saluted, then stepped back through the door and pulled it closed. There was the metal rattle of the hatch seal. Augusta said, ‘We are close to Compline, captain. Please, proceed.’ ‘Sister Superior, Sisters Militant.’ He picked up his data-slate, waited as its glassy surface flowed with text. Then, with a sigh as though he were bracing himself, he said, ‘The orders I have received read as follows. “Effective immediately, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus of the Order of the Bloody Rose is to relinquish all prior mission instructions. She is to muster her squad, and to report to the following coordinates. A full deployment of weapons and battlegear will be expected. A full brief will be issued upon landing. Ave Imperator.”’ He turned the slate to show them. ‘It’s signed with Inquisitor Istrix’s personal seal.’ Viola muttered; Augusta silenced her with a sharp look. Melia asked, her velvet voice cool, ‘What are these coordinates, captain? We should at least know where we’re bound.’ The captain sat down and laid the slate back on the desk, giving himself time. After a moment, he said, ‘This is a quiet corner of the void, Sister – something of a rarity. And the Kyrus is an older ship, her armaments unsuitable for heavy combat. When the Tukril was deployed to Lautis, we were deemed… enough… to accompany her.’ Augusta studied him, wondering where this was going. He said, ‘I would guess that we’re the only Imperial ship within reach.’ Melia said, voice soft with danger, ‘Reach of what?’ The captain turned to the pict-screen behind him, let its surface flow with an image – a single, reddening star, a single, ringed planet. He said, ‘There is a Class Four star three Solar days from here, Sister, that has a solitary, satellite world.’ The screen moved, closing its focus upon the planet itself. ‘It’s known to the ships of the region as a place to avoid. Some even call it notorious.’ Melia frowned at the word; the other three shifted, their armour scraping. The captain continued, ‘My orders, however, do not include the luxury of either speculation or avoidance. These coordinates will take you to Imperial Munitorum depot eight-nine-zero-point-four-five, upon the surface of the planet Lycheate.’ Augusta blinked – the name meant nothing to her. ‘Permission to speak, Sister.’ The voice was Akemi’s. ‘Granted.’ She said, ‘Captain. “Lycheate” meaning… industrial waste?’ ‘That’s as good a description as any,’ the captain said. ‘Lycheate is local slang, a nickname – your map would name the world Vastum.’ The pict-screen shifted, closing focus upon the planet. ‘It was a forge world, founded during the Age of Redemption by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Its considerable output helped fuel the Macharian Conquest, among other things.’ ‘But no longer?’ Augusta said. She’d felt the others tense – they’d already had one experience with long-dead machinery, though it had come from a very different time. Melia indicated the planet’s encircling ellipsis. ‘What is the ring, captain? Debris? Or defence?’ ‘Three hundred years ago,’ the captain said, ‘Lycheate had more than twenty moons, the largest of them barely two thousand miles across. They were finally stripped of all their resources when the Iron Duke Glevan stormed Bastoom.’ His smile was grim. ‘But you know the Mechanicus, they never waste anything. The moons were detonated at their cores to ensure that every last scrap of ore could be stripped for the war effort. The more valuable fragments were towed–’ ‘And the rest now orbit the planet,’ Melia said. ‘A ring of wreckage.’ ‘Just so, Sister.’ The screen closed in further, focusing on the fragments. Augusta could feel Akemi shifting, committing the images to memory. ‘There’s something you’re omitting, captain,’ Augusta said. ‘Why is this world to be avoided, if it’s so long dead?’ ‘The world is far from dead, sadly,’ the captain said. ‘Only the spirits of the machines themselves.’ His smile was mirthless. ‘I regret to inform you, Sisters, that Lycheate is very much alive. ‘And our first problem will be getting you to the surface.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE In the back of the Aquila-class shuttle, the vox-grille crackled into life. ‘…ist… zzz… assist… urg…’ The five members of Augusta’s squad were seated in the old landing craft, each one fully armoured, and strapped into her chair. The shuttle was battered, its hangings and its dignitaries’ throne long since removed. It had tiny, double-layered glassaic windowpanes, and, above their heads, the observation dome was long since welded shut. Wherever this craft had been, it’d had more adventures than simply delivering persons of importance to critical locations. Melia, sitting beside Augusta in the front row, leaned forwards. ‘Pilot? Can we investigate that signal?’ The pilot’s voice came back over the vox-grille, her tone politely firm. ‘We’re about to enter the planet’s debris field, Sister,’ she said, ‘and our course is very tightly plotted. If we’re to make planetfall in time for your briefing, we can’t be making side trips.’ Melia sat back, her expression closed. The squad’s new second was Hospitaller trained, had spent time with the Order of Serenity, and she had a unique streak of compassion that was both a blessing and a nuisance. Augusta understood her concerns, but the squad was under orders. ‘Sister,’ she said. ‘You have never encountered the Inquisition, but believe me, we will need to arrive promptly.’ Melia glanced at her, her expression a question. Augusta said, raising her voice a little so the others could hear, ‘Only once, and only briefly – Inquisitor Tuccius and his storm troopers came to the planet Lyca, investigating the High Deacon. They wield fear like a weapon, authority like a banner – they answer to the Emperor alone. I know nothing of Istrix herself, but she is the holy servant of the Emperor, His will made manifest, and our service to her is an honour.’ Melia said, ‘Aye, Sister,’ and sat back, murmuring a prayer. The vox-grille crackled again. ‘Approaching the debris field now. Be warned, Sisters, this could get rough.’ The engines fired and slowed. Augusta touched a hand to the front of her armour, breathing the words of the litany. ‘By the Light!’ The awed whisper was Akemi. They all turned. Below them, the planet Lycheate lay waiting, the haze-blur of its atmosphere a dirty, reddish-brown. To their left, its star was sullen, red and swollen with vast age. But it was not the star, nor its satellite, that had caught the squad’s attention. Outside the shuttle, the first of the moon-pieces was now coming past them, a slow and silent tumble of shattered rock. It was oddly serene; a turning of glitter and angle, of dark, crystalline colours all frosted with cold. And soon, there were hundreds of them. Thousands. The Sisters sat staring, their breaths taken away. As they passed, many of the fragments offered hints of their previous life – of the frozen edges of mine workings, of scaffold and steel, of vox-antennae and torn-open habitat. There was industry wreckage, like the shattered splinters of the great machine-spirit, all snapped and broken, its pieces still reaching out to the vacuum. Augusta could almost imagine the moons’ endings, that silent boom of slow motion detonations, one after another, the spiralling of the pieces forming the ring that now orbited this lost Mechanicus world. It was a reminder of the Emperor’s power, of His grace and strength, of His great might that spanned the vastness of space. The shuttle slowed. Its engines fired as it curved carefully from side to side. Still watching, Augusta offered her voice in a Requiem. Around her, the others lent their song to hers – Melia’s velvet contralto, Akemi’s pure, clear harmony. ‘Dies Irae, Dies Illa! Solvet saeclum in favilla!’ The Day of Wrath! That day will dissolve the world in ashes! The Sister Superior shivered. Under her vambraces, the hair on her forearms was standing on end. The grille crackled again, shattering the moment. ‘Pleazzz… assist… oxy… deplet… hours…’ ‘In the Emperor’s name,’ Melia said softly. ‘There can’t still be workers out there!’ ‘Ignore it, Sister.’ The voice was the pilot, her tone still firm. Melia sat upright, her expression hardening. ‘Pilot–’ ‘Sister,’ Augusta said. A larger piece of moon loomed close to the window, a gleam of tram-lines clearly visible. ‘Let the pilot focus. We must attain the surface safely, and without delay.’ The words were a warning, and Melia fell silent. But the vox-grille still crackled, the voice now tightening with panic. It was offering coordinates, the numbers broken by the spit and fizzle of the star’s radiation, and by the spin of the passing rock. ‘That’s close,’ Caia said, checking her auspex. ‘Those coordinates are–’ ‘It’s not a distress call.’ The pilot’s interruption was curt. Melia stared at the vox-grille. ‘What?’ Augusta was studying the silent dance outside, watching the edges of the rocks as they slowly sailed past. The one at the window had gone, revealing a longer view – and a silhouette of familiar shapes. A line of titanic gun-muzzles, now covering the debris field. They turned, tracking the Aquila as it passed. ‘Hold on!’ The voice was the pilot’s, suddenly sharp. The old shuttle banked hard, into a turn; Augusta’s belly lurched. The engines whined and strained; their noise burrowed in her ears like a bloodworm. Outside the window, the moon-pieces pitched abruptly sideways and were gone. Gripping the arms of the chair, she leaned back, exhaling more of the hymn. ‘Imperator majistatis, Qui salvandos salvas gratis, Salva nos, fons pietatis!’ Emperor of majesty, Who saves those who are to be saved, Save us, O fount of mercy! ‘Keep holding!’ The pilot spoke again, her tone tight. With a rush, the vehicle banked further, turning right over; the fragments outside were suddenly way too close for comfort. The Sister Superior tightened her grip, still praying. She had no fear of dying in battle – weapons in hands and praising Him – but this, this sudden threat of a cold and unmarked doom… This was not something she could control, and she disliked it intensely. The vox-grille spoke again. ‘The signal is an automation, Sisters, calculated to lure unwary transports. If the defences don’t kill us, then the collision probably will. And the pieces can be picked up by the pirates.’ The pilot’s voice spat and sputtered with electricity and tension. ‘With the Emperor’s blessing, we should clear the debris field in about four– And again.’ The Aquila banked the other way, throwing Augusta sideways in the seat. She could feel the shuttle’s engines as the vehicle twisted and shuddered, hear them straining, higher and lighter than those of the frigate. They hummed in protest as it turned past another huge fragment of rock. Drawing in her breath, she murmured further lines of the Requiem, the sound blending harmoniously with the engines’ song. ‘Confutatis maledictis, Fammis acribus addictis Voca me com benedictis!’ Once the accursed have been silenced, Sentenced to acrid flames, Call me thus with the blessed! ‘Four minutes,’ Viola said, her tone biting. ‘I thought Captain Mulier said the emplacements were abandoned?’ ‘Not all of them,’ Akemi answered her. ‘When the Mechanicus withdrew from Lycheate, they must have armed the debris ring to keep the planet secure. It seems their emplacements have been repurposed.’ ‘But there’s no gravity, no reactors, no nothing,’ Caia said, looking out at the pieces. ‘How can anything live out here?’ ‘They’re probably controlled from the surface,’ Akemi said. ‘They…’ She stopped as one of the visible emplacements suddenly blossomed with globular flame. A red streak came hard across the darkness; the whole vessel shook as it banked for a fourth turn. The Sisters could almost feel the missile as it streaked beneath the agile lander’s belly, then detonated on the rock beyond. More fragments tumbled, tiny pieces newly broken. ‘That one wasn’t automated,’ Caia said. ‘That targeted the engines.’ She raised her voice to speak into the grille, ‘Can we return fire, pilot?’ ‘I’d rather not, Sister,’ the pilot said, her tone sharp. ‘We’re not armed for a fight. Better we just get out of here, and into the atmosphere proper. Once we’re through the debris-ring, this should get easier.’ ‘Let them concentrate, Sister,’ Augusta said, again. Her tone was sharper than she’d meant it, and she made an effort to speak with proper control. ‘This is not our task. We will place our trust in the God-Emperor, in the spirit of this landing craft, and in its pilot, who does His work.’ She ended the Requiem and began to murmur the more familiar words of the litany, and felt the others join her. Felt them steady. From the lightning and the tempest… As if it had heard them, the vehicle returned again to a level flight path, and Augusta felt her belly-tension ease. Beside her, Melia blew out her breath; the others sat back, began to relax. The last of the pieces of rock sailed slowly past the windows, and were gone. Beneath them now, the planet gleamed like rust. Engines firing, the Aquila picked up speed. Soon, they felt the bounce and judder as the shuttle penetrated the outer atmosphere. And slowly, a glittering arc of light to the eyes of the planet below, it began its descent. ‘Sister. Superior. Augusta. Santorus.’ Inquisitor Istrix pronounced each word like a passing of her judgement, chill and merciless. ‘Your closeness to my location must be the Will of the Emperor Himself.’ Her faintly acerbic tone echoed in the empty metal shelving that surrounded them, in the corrosion of centuries that stretched upwards to an unseen ceiling. With its loading bay doors now closed, the old Munitorum depot was large enough to have accommodated the ­Aquila’s landing, small enough to be secure, and secure enough to be guarded by whatever force Istrix had brought with her. Privately, Augusta complimented the inquisitor on her choice of briefing location – there was little that could reach them in here. Aloud, however, the Sister Superior said nothing. She and her squad stood at parade ground attention: feet together, hands at their sides, their gazes clear and straight ahead. In her black armour and grey robes, Istrix barely came up to Augusta’s nose, yet the mantle of her authority was tangible. She eyed them critically, one after another. Her odd, pale green gaze took in the scars on their armour left by the Lautis daemons, the purity seals, the merit-beads, the elaborate filigree work on Viola’s thrice-blessed heavy bolter. She looked like she was ticking them off a list. ‘The Order of the Bloody Rose,’ she continued, her words still heavily weighted. ‘Followers of Saint Mina. One of the younger militant Orders, and founded by Deacis IV. Your Order have quite the martial reputation, Sister Superior, ferocious with both faith and blade. Is this true?’ ‘Emperor willing, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, still staring straight ahead. Istrix nodded. ‘Good. Your courage becomes you.’ At the inquisitor’s shoulder, there stood a tall young man, his gear Militarum issue, all green and beige, his skin rich and dark. His brassard bore two stripes, but scars and dirt had obscured his regimental insignia. From the state of his kit, he looked like he’d been here for some time. ‘I know your canoness,’ Istrix said. She made no attempt to explain the comment, but went on, ‘Captain Mulier will convey to her my orders. Down here, securing off-planet communication can be… challenging.’ She gave a small, cold smile. ‘It is possible, but it requires either force, or coin. And until recently, my presence has been… necessarily discreet.’ The corporal kept his eyes on his boots. ‘Very well, Sisters,’ Istrix said. ‘At ease. And listen up.’ The inquisitor’s briefing was curt. Lycheate, she told them, was a sewer; a filthy, seething sump-hive of a world. The planet’s surface was ninety-five per cent water, now heavily polluted with the effluvium of centuries. Over it had been built vast ferrocrete and flex­steel platforms, supporting the endless, methodical grids of Mechanicus machines – furnaces, regulators, incinerators. They stretched for thousands of miles, a planet-wide city of industry and labour, once teeming with servitors and tech-priests alike. But, the Mechanicus had gone. With the moons destroyed, they’d taken everything else of value, spoken the last rites of the Omnissiah, and they’d left Lycheate to die. And yet, Istrix had said, no corner of the Imperium was ever free from the ingenuity of the determined heretic. Some two hundred years before, the cargo scow Egestes had proven itself too curious, and had skimmed just too close. Damaged by the debris field, it had crash-landed upon the planet’s surface. And so, Lycheate’s new life had begun. The scow had been carrying the Questor Heretek Vius, and his multiple servitors and helots. And Vius had been curious about what he’d discovered – he had determined to scour every last inch of this world for its lost machinery and data-ghosts. Under Vius’ relentless, methodical direction, his minions had spread out across the planet, exploring, seeking, repurposing. They’d breathed just enough new life into the last sparks of the fusion reactor; they’d found habitats still intact, infrastructure still usable. And the vox-antennae could be repaired, and repurposed. ‘Come to me,’ Vius had said, his datastream reaching out across the void. ‘Come to me, and I will offer you a new beginning.’ The Sisters had listened to Istrix’s clipped, meticulous tones, watched the shadows as they passed across the face of the corporal – he seemed barely more than a boy. Augusta eyed his youth, and his battered kit, and wondered what he was doing here. Istrix said, ‘Have you ever encountered a renegade world, Sisters? A world where the Light of the Emperor has been not only lost, but wantonly abandoned?’ The question was rhetorical; she continued to speak. ‘You wonder why this world has not been purged, and I tell you – its day of reckoning will come. For now, however, its existence will be tolerated, as it conceals a greater prize.’ The corporal’s expression flickered, though his stance did not falter. Glancing at him, Istrix said, ‘Corporal Mors is a young man of very great courage. He has seen his squad slain around him, screaming with fear, and he has stood fast. He has earned your respect, Sisters. And this world must do likewise. You will not walk out of here and open fire – you will run out of ammunition long before you run out of targets. Do I make myself clear? Any cleansing will come only when I speak the word.’ The chill in her voice was cracking at the edges, though Augusta could not tell why. In the Sister Superior’s ear, her vox-bead fizzled as a channel opened, but whichever Sister had been going to speak thought better of it, and said nothing. ‘Yes, ma’am,’ Augusta said. ‘Perfectly clear.’ ‘I’m glad to hear it,’ Istrix told her. Again, that touch of acerbity, of bleak, cold humour. ‘For now, we are secure – my shuttle is secured here, and this compound and its immediate surround are safe. But once we leave this location, my resources are few. Lycheate is a lawless world, Sisters – a world of pirate and trader and ganger, of human and xenos, of cultist and witch and psyker. There is no Ecclesiarchy here, no governor. No neat chimes to mark the hours.’ Her face was sharp, narrow as a hatchet. ‘Here, the order is one of power, of wit and money, of force and reputation. And much as I have tried to remain unremarkable, my life has already been attempted several times.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘Needless to say, those attempts have been thwarted. With you at my back, however, I can employ a somewhat more… forceful… approach.’ She fell silent, almost as if she was thinking. Augusta said, ‘A question, inquisitor.’ Istrix nodded, and the Sister Superior said, ‘What is it that you pursue?’ What is so important that you spare this world to find it? The inquisitor paused, her oddly pale eyes narrowing. ‘You ask me why I permit this world its miserable life?’ Again, the same, cold smile. ‘Your reputation is not unearned, Sister Superior.’ From somewhere, there came the whoosh of hydraulics, the sound of shouts and lasgun fire. Screaming. Viola twitched, put a hand to the heavy bolter, but the noises soon faded again. The inquisitor said, ‘How would you feel, Sister, if you were betrayed by one of your squad?’ Augusta blinked – the question had caught her out. It was shocking, unthinkable, verging almost on blasphemous. And there was no answer that she could make that was not an outright refusal to accept the inquisitor’s words – and the breach of her orders would be severe. She said, ‘Ma’am?’ Istrix tapped the bolter at her hip. ‘My target,’ she said, ‘is a man called Scafidis Zale. He is a witch, a heretic, and a reminder of my ultimate failure.’ Her skin flushed faintly, showing a latticework of recent scars – the marks both regular and deliberate. ‘He was my interrogator until his… ability… became manifest. And he refused the path that the Emperor had chosen for him.’ Something in her gaze glittered like the ice of the debris-field. ‘And in the name of Terra itself, I will end him personally.’ The final word made an odd chill go down Augusta’s back. But this was the Inquisition – and it was not her place to disobey.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR In all the years of her service to the Emperor, Augusta had never seen a planet quite like Lycheate. This was not a place for her martial expertise, nor a place for skirmish tactics or strategic advances. This was a vast and creaking sprawl of corrosion and splotched rust, its polluted waters hissing as they tugged at the crumbling uprights. Looking down, she didn’t need an auspex to tell her if she fell from the platform, she’d be kneeling before the Golden Throne. The inquisitor, however, paid the filthy water no attention. She showed no fear – the only emotion that crossed her small, tight face was disdain. She’d given her troops a curt set of orders, and had requisitioned Sister Caia to be her personal lookout and bodyguard. And then, she’d walked out as if she owned the entire planet. Augusta had followed, watching the woman’s upright, grey-robed back. The Sister Superior’s thoughts were oddly uneasy – though she could not identify why. Perhaps it was just the air of the planet itself. Out in the open, Lycheate’s atmosphere was thick, brown and cold. As they moved away from the base and out onto the layers of walkways, the wind made the scaffolding creak and sing. Metallic dust clogged her visor, and she kept wiping it away. Istrix at their head, they walked silent and double file. The platforms groaned and scraped beneath their feet. Over the vox, Akemi warned them not to march in rhythm, as they would increase the stress on the already rotting metal, and tumble helpless into the waters below. At times, half-decomposed bodies floated under them like warnings. Augusta walked warily, bolter in hand. In her scarlet armour, she felt conspicuous, exposed to threats from every angle. A thousand ambush points surrounded them – layers of steps and catwalks, of pipes and gantries, of lifts and tracks and carts and rusting cargo-haulers. And, if she looked all the way up, she could see the narrow strip of the brown and twilight sky, and the sparkle of the debris field in the light of the dying sun. The whole place stank of rot, as if He had turned His face from the last of its corroding, fading life. A spiritu dominatus… Softly and over the vox, she sang the words of the litany. The others joined her, their close harmonies rising like the wind in the pipework. He was here, as He always would be. Behind the Sisters, their big boots loud, walked Corporal Mors and the surviving three members of his squad – Rufus the medicae, a scar through his brown eyebrow, Lucio, small and blond and bright-eyed, and a rangy, dark woman, Adriene. They were all equally grubby and startlingly young, but they walked alert, weapons in hands. The inquisitor, however, did not bother to look back – she marched at their forefront with no flicker of doubt or compromise, marched like the demand of the Emperor Himself. At the briefing, she had offered them only a minimal set of orders; she had not as much as detailed an outline of her mission. They were here to locate the witch, and they were not to open fire without her direct command. That was all. The lack of information was both unusual and unsettling, but Istrix was the will of the Emperor, and she worked in His name – it was not Augusta’s place to question her. Domine, libra nos. The words of the litany flowed like faith, pure across the umber air. ‘Be wary,’ Augusta told her Sisters, over the vox. ‘We track a psyker. Trickery may abound. Keep vigilant, and guard your souls and your minds.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ The words of the others were steady, their litany strong. Their voices continued to sing, soft and intricate. As they moved further, however, the Sisters began to hear different noises. Clanking. Shouting. Gunfire. Detonations. Running feet. The unmistakeable sounds of heavy, desperate splashing. Caia said, ‘To our left, next platform over. They’re not bothered with us. They’re moving away.’ The surrounding violence was rapidly becoming common-place. From the lightning and the tempest… Amid the song of the litany, Augusta commented, ‘We are very visible – we will be a target, and soon.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Aye,’ Caia returned. ‘Scan continues.’ They went onwards, the sounds around them becoming more frequent. They had seen no one close, not yet, but it was surely only a matter of time before the denizens of this place made themselves known. Renegades, cultists and witches; the lost and the godless. Augusta’s hand tightened on her weapon, her skin prickled with tension. Somewhere in her memory, she heard Subul’s laughter, the boom and rumble of the Lautis daemon… From plague, temptation and war… ‘Sisters,’ Caia said. ‘We’ve got company.’ ‘Location?’ Augusta said. ‘To the left. Half a dozen contacts running parallel. Whatever’s here, we’ve got its attention.’ ‘I hear you. Eyes open.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘You will remain on your guard, Sisters.’ Cutting across the vox’s open channel, Istrix’s tones were severe. ‘But I repeat – you will open fire only if I give you a direct order. Is that understood?’ Augusta said, ‘Yes, inquisitor.’ ‘For now, we will veer right, and remain out of range.’ Pulled by the inquisitor’s relentless forward march, they continued. Slowly, the platforms spread wider, became flat, open spaces that stretched between vat and tank and workshop, all of them engraved with the cog-and-skull of the absent Mechanicus. The brown sky slowly darkened, and the age-old lumens coughed into life. The centuries-old numerical denominations became cast in shadows; they, too, were caked in dust. The contacts continued to run parallel. ‘We’ve got more,’ Caia said. ‘Now both sides. They’re starting to close.’ From the scourge of the Kraken… ‘They’re herding us,’ Augusta commented. ‘We must halt, and take a defensible position–’ ‘Throne!’ Caia’s curse was vehement. ‘We’ve walked right into the middle of them!’ Our Emperor, deliver us! Augusta’s heart thumped with sudden adrenaline. She blinked in her retinal lenses, scanned with her preysight for the blurs of warmth. Her mind was working – she needed to assess, to give commands, to formulate both offence and defence… Somewhere ahead of her, a voice said, ‘Nice to see you, ladies.’ Istrix held up a hand. ‘Halt.’ Immediately, Augusta said, ‘Defence pattern beta. Mors, pull your troops back behind our cover.’ All four Sisters deployed to a compass defence, watching every direction. The Militarum soldiers pulled back into their centre, their lasrifles defended by the Sisters’ ­heavier armour. Scanning for enemies, Augusta said, ‘Caia?’ Caia said, ‘Ahead and to both sides, close range. Multiple targets. Estimate more than forty individuals, though it’s hard to tell their armament.’ ‘Mechanicus?’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia said. ‘Mostly human. They’re confident, though. And they definitely knew we were coming.’ Istrix, however, didn’t care. ‘Show yourself.’ A snort answered her. Angled from somewhere below the platform, a single red light appeared on her chest. She looked at it as one might look at an insect. Bolter in hand, awaiting the order to fire, Augusta scanned further, assembling information. The platform they stood upon was open, and almost alone – the planet’s waters stretched around it, black and deadly and filled with garbage. Ahead of them, the area narrowed to a single walkway, a narrow steel alley caught between a rust-splotched tank at one side and a tall wall of storage crates on the other. At their top perched a huge servo-hauler crane. It was too obvious an ambush point – and if that crane came down, it would smash the entire platform into the filth below… From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The Sister Superior drew in her breath, still singing the litany, the words as strong as the bolter in her hand. She held herself firmly in check, looking for the escape routes, the clear lines of fire, the tell-tale glimmers of warmth that were there, there and there. She could feel the eagerness that came from them; feel the seething corruption of this whole place. It crawled in her skin like an infection. Our Emperor, deliver us. Her anger, her need to fire, was strong. Her purpose was pure, clear, unquestioned; the thump of the blood in her veins was steady, insistent. She needed to draw her blade, to bring His wrath down upon every suffering, sneering occupant of this machine-dead pit… But she could not. Despite her need to loose both hymnal and bolter, however, she stayed in control. Twenty years’ experience had given the Sister Superior a solid core of practicality that enabled her to hold her position, and wait. She said, softly and over the vox, ‘Corporal, when the order is given to open fire, your squad will take the upper levels. Your primary targets will be atop the tank, and anything upon the crane. Everything close belongs to us.’ Mors said, ‘Yes, Sister.’ The voice came again, mocking. ‘Quite the army you’ve got there. Little thing like you.’ ‘I said, show yourself.’ Istrix’s tone was ice. ‘Listen to you.’ The voice sniggered. ‘Thinking you can walk round here like you own the place.’ Istrix snorted, the sound utterly scathing. ‘What’s she doing?’ Viola said, over their private channel. ‘Can’t she just give him orders or some–?’ ‘Silence,’ Augusta told her shortly. Viola subsided, but the muzzle of the heavy bolter twitched as it covered the walkway ahead. Augusta heard the corporal growl softly, ‘Hold steady, eyes open. Keep pressure on the – shit!’ Ahead of them, something big and metallic had rumbled into motion. The walkway creaked under its weight. ‘Kataphron,’ Caia said shortly, her tone a curse. ‘Breacher, I think. It’s blocking the exit. Heavy rifle in its left arm. Looks like it’s been scratch-repaired.’ ‘Keep vigilant, Sisters,’ Augusta said. ‘There may be more.’ The Sister Superior’s line of sight was blocked by Istrix’s armoured figure, but she could still make out the thing’s brutal, half-metal skull, its blank and open eyes, one of them gleaming red with an augmetic targeter. She heard the metal grumble of tracks as the thing rolled forwards. ‘So, why don’t we give you a proper Lycheate welcome, ladies?’ The owner of the voice was somewhere below them, and Augusta couldn’t see him. ‘Weapons on the floor, hands in the sky. Unless you want my friend here to get tetchy.’ Istrix gave a short, impatient sigh. ‘Sister Superior, rid us of this obstacle.’ And then everything happened at once. They had little cover, and less time. As Istrix gave her order, the inquisitor vaulted clean over the railing and dropped from Augusta’s line of sight, her movements surprisingly lithe. Caia followed her. Dropping to a kneel, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Take it down!’ From the begetting of daemons! She heard the litany hit a crescendo, heard a heavy bolter as it thundered into a full, directed burst. In the open channel of the vox, there was a faint, awed whistle from one of the Militarum soldiers. ‘Shut it.’ The corporal growled the warning. ‘Corp.’ The voice sounded like Lucio, the youngest of the four. Viola, her hymn fully as furious as the bolter itself, loosed her full rage at the tracked servitor. But the thing was just too big. It was slow, clunky, poorly repaired – yet its chest armour was heavy, all clumsily re-welded pieces of flexsteel. Rounds struck and spanged, leaving dents. Snarling, Viola aimed at its head, but a heavy, spot-welded helmet defeated the directed burst. The thing’s torso rocked; detonations filled the air. Its shoulder grinding audibly, it raised the rifle. And the servitor was not alone. From behind Augusta came the cough and roar of Melia’s flamer. Sheltered from the Breacher by the curve of the tank, the rest of the gang were jumping down to the platform, a scruffy assortment of pirates and roughnecks, their armour scavenged, their weapons poor. Our Emperor, deliver us! The flamer spat death. Attackers ignited, weapons exploding as magazines overheated. Melia, too, called the words of the litany, her anger seeming almost a blessing as she freed the nonbelievers from their cursed existence. ‘By the Emperor,’ Lucio was still muttering, his tones awed. ‘I’ve never seen fighting like it!’ Mors snapped, ‘I said, shut it.’ Knowing they couldn’t see, Augusta let herself grin, tight and lethal. ‘Go down, you cursed machine!’ Viola swore; the Breacher guttered and rocked, but the grinding continued. Any moment, it would hose the platform with rounds. ‘Back!’ The Sister Superior barked orders. ‘Use the tank as cover! Viola, take out the tracks!’ Shoving the soldiers behind her, she and the other two Sisters retreated back across the main platform. High-speed explosions chewed lines of holes in the metal of tank and walkway both, making them creak and screech. Viola followed the Sisters’ retreat, her bolter still battering the thing as it tried to roll forwards. From the curse of the mutant! With a sudden, livid cry that was more snarl than hymn, she aimed her full rate of fire at the joint where the walkway met the platform. A volley of rounds hit and detonated. The walkway juddered and cracked. As the monster servitor rolled onwards, its tracks found the weak point. There was a scrape and a jolt, and the whole thing pitched nose-down, the heavy rifle now aimed at the waters below. This time, even the corporal loosed a curse. But, even as metal creaking grew more urgent, the heavy bolter thumped and clattered as it ran out of ammunition. ‘Above you!’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Heads up!’ A head and forearm were poking from the top of the tank, a long barrel just coming into view. The corporal hit the sniper cleanly, his single shot sizzling across the half-light. Augusta watched the figure’s head explode, the body teeter and plummet. Melia’s flamer whooshed again – a great spitting curve as she brought the weapon round in an arc. Screams followed, bodies tumbled, splashing as they hit the water. In an instant, fire roared across the water’s oily surface, lighting the entire platform to a ruddy-hued hellscape. The metal creaked again. Still at Augusta’s shoulder, the corporal barked, ‘There’s more of them! On top of the crane!’ Lasguns sizzled at another layer of snipers. The air cracked with lines of heat. The attackers swore and fell back, holes seared in their vulnerable flesh. Another one tumbled loose, and hit the catwalk with a crash. The metal shook again. ‘It’s going to collapse!’ Akemi said. Her bolter barked as she kept firing. ‘Motion slowing.’ Caia’s voice came through the vox. ‘I’ve got fleeing contacts on all sides.’ Augusta heard the grin, heard the sharp crack of her weapon as she made sure. ‘Mercenaries!’ The word was a snort. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said. ‘What’s your location?’ ‘Look down,’ Caia replied. ‘I’m still with the inquisitor. And she’s requesting… demanding… your presence.’ Leaving the other three Sisters and the four Militarum soldiers under Melia’s command, Augusta saw immediately where Istrix had gone – the inquisitor had followed the angle of the earlier targeter, and had jumped from the walkway. She’d landed on a small lift platform, some four feet below. Sister Caia was still with her – and she had shoved her bolter, hard, under the chin of a small and grubby figure. Over the Sisters’ vox, she said, ‘Look, we’ve caught ourselves a rat.’ As Augusta jumped down, the man’s dirty, lined face paled even further. ‘Hey, I’m just trying to make a living!’ ‘You’re a thief and a bully,’ Caia said curtly. ‘And your “living” is over.’ ‘Please, Sister, I was only–’ he stopped as the bolter pressed harder. The inquisitor said, her tone like steel, ‘You have made a very unwise mistake.’ ‘Please!’ The man was almost gibbering. ‘We just collect the tithes, that’s all. Y’know, try to survive, make a little profit–’ ‘Tithes?’ Istrix grabbed his shirt and shook him like a captured gretchin. ‘Are you some local baron, to make such demands?’ ‘I’m no one, not really.’ He was stammering, scared. ‘I just work here. But I do know things. I can help you.’ He gave a sickly, ingratiating grin. ‘If you’re heading to the city, I can get you in. I know the routes. The people. I can tell you who you need to find.’ Augusta still flanking her like a bodyguard, Istrix stepped back and pulled a long votive chain from the neck of her grey robe. On its end, it bore the symbol of the Inquisition, glittering in the light from flame and lumens both. The man swallowed, going green. ‘You know who I am?’ Her cold tones were layered with both authority and scorn. ‘The…’ The man’s face changed. Glancing down, the Sister Superior could see the dark patch now flooding the front of his trousers. He gibbered, ‘I can tell you anything, everything you need to know. Please…’ ‘Maybe you can.’ Istrix gave a small, amused smile. ‘You listen to me, little man, and you listen well. I am the word of the Emperor and I am His law. I have the Sisters of Battle at my back, carrying His faith and His torch. And there is no force on this miserable planet, nothing Zale can array against me, nothing he can muster, that is enough to stop me, or to get in my way. Do you understand? Now – tell me where he’s gone.’ ‘Where who’s gone? I don’t know who you mean!’ The man was almost sobbing with fear. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know…’ ‘Whether he’s lying or not,’ Caia commented, over the vox, ‘he’ll betray us the moment we’ve gone.’ ‘Of course he will.’ Augusta stepped forwards, and bent the man back over the lift’s metal railing. The water sloshed and hissed. The last of the flames had flickered to nothing and the garbage on its surface was ash. ‘Enough,’ Istrix said. ‘He lives. On one condition.’ ‘Anything.’ The man was snivelling, snot running down his face. ‘Anything. Just – please – don’t build me into a machine!’ ‘I would not bestow such a blessing upon you,’ she said, scathing. ‘Besides, I doubt you would have the stamina for it. I need you to do something for me.’ He sniffled. ‘Whatever you want. Whoever you want.’ Istrix said, ‘Do you know a woman called Rayos?’ Augusta and Caia exchanged a glance, but said nothing. The inquisitor continued. ‘She’s a local, a seeker of knowledge, and she’s very… distinctive.’ Her tone seemed oddly amused. ‘She’s one of my few known contacts on this cesspit of a world. Do you know who she is?’ Sniffling, the man nodded. ‘You will take her a message.’ He said, ‘Rayos doesn’t–’ ‘You were given an order, worm,’ Caia said, her bolter pressing harder. Istrix shot the Sister a sharp look for speaking out of line; let the look continue to Augusta, a raised eyebrow at her discipline of her troops. ‘All right, all right!’ The man was sobbing now. ‘I’ll do anything!’ On the platform above them, pairs of armoured legs were moving in methodical patterns as the squad despatched the last of their opponents, and threw the bodies over the side. The black boots of the corporal had appeared beside the heavy metal tracks of the doomed Breacher, and a single ­sizzle of light finally shut the thing down. ‘If you lie to me…’ Istrix leaned in close, and spoke softly, ‘I won’t only kill you, little man. I will tear your soul into screaming pieces. And I’ll do it slowly.’ The man had sunk to the floor. He was curling in on himself, almost numb with terror. Istrix planted her boot against his shoulder and made him look up. ‘Well?’ Slowly, still sniffing, he began to nod. ‘I know the woman you mean. She’s been here a long time. Gets a lot of work. Knows a lot of people. I’ll take her your message.’ ‘I thought so.’ The inquisitor was smiling, her scars creasing with the expression. ‘Tell her… tell her I’m here. Tell her to be in the Archeotech, this evening. Tell her… I have a deal to make. And that I can make it worth her while.’ The man was still nodding, relief flooding the movement. ‘I promise, I promise. In the Emperor’s name.’ ‘Very well,’ Istrix said, moving her foot. ‘You can go.’ ‘With all due respect, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, ‘this creature surely cannot be trusted…’ ‘I gave you an order, Sister Superior.’ Istrix’s tone was cold. ‘Release him. He may betray us, but that also works to my advantage.’ She turned, her pale green eyes alight with an odd intensity. ‘I want Zale to know I’m coming. I want him to know that I have the Sisters of Battle at my back. And I want him afraid.’ Her tone was firm. Over the vox, Caia said, ‘Sister Superior–’ ‘Do not voice the thought, Sister,’ Augusta warned her. ‘To question the inquisitor is heresy.’ Both Sisters stepped back. Fast as a rat, the man was over the railing and gone. Istrix lifted her chin, her expression stony. Her fine latticework of scars glowed like inlaid wires. She said, ‘We are the chosen of the Emperor, Sisters, His children, and we fear nothing. What is there ahead of us that can defeat the will of the Inquisition, and the faith of the Sisters of Battle? This city holds no fears for such as we.’ Augusta saluted, said, ‘Mea fides est, et ferrum armis.’ My faith is my shield and my blade. ‘Sister…’ Again, Caia’s voice over the Sisters’ private channel. ‘Be silent.’ Augusta answered the unspoken doubt with no compromise in her tone. ‘She is the voice of the God-Emperor, and we will not discuss this again.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Lycheate city was designated ‘City-05’, and the crush and the stench were incredible. The place was a cacophony of noise – metallic music, harsh and jangling; voices, raised in shouts and anger. Everywhere, there was the push and shove of filthy, reeking humanity, with orks and beastmen in the seething crowd. There was the flit of the thief, the bulge of the mutant, the bellow of the roustabout thug. Sister Melia had seen such things before – she and Caia had both been with Augusta on Hadria, on their mission to recapture the renegade rogue trader Samual – but still, the stink and the corruption of this place crawled under her skin like an infection. She hated it; she needed to offer it the cleansing it so richly craved. She could feel the Sister Superior’s rising impatience, and her restraint; could feel the sharp sense of wariness that came from Akemi and Viola both, ­neither of them long from the schola. Yet Melia, her Hospitaller training rising in her heart, contorted with something else. These people had lost their way, lost the Light. They should be purged; they should be granted the Emperor’s final peace… She walked with her hand on her flamer, itching to pull it free. Around them, much of the machinery had been prayed to new life. It rattled and clanked. New devotions had been embossed into its surfaces; its old Mechanicus ­symbols had been cleaned and polished, or defaced and carved over. Liquid rumbled through endless pipes; bursts of steam hissed free from louvered vents, and rose, ghost-pale, into the almost-dark sky. The hauler engines were running here, clattering loudly in their tracks. Screen linked to screen and silent information flowed almost palpably across the air. In places, there were figures tending to them, praying. Melia caught flashes of additional limbs, of extended augmetics and hood-covered faces… Of the twists of warp and ruin that crept from the Mechanicus’ remaining skin. She shuddered. This whole place was a hive, a living, breathing melting-pot of machinery, and every type of depravity clamoured in its suspended steel streets. Before her, Sister Akemi walked slowly, a prayer on her lips. Melia was about to intercede when Augusta stopped beside the youngest Sister and gripped her shoulder in one gauntleted hand. ‘Have faith, Sister,’ she said. ‘He is with us, even here. Keep your thoughts on His light, and the despair of this place cannot touch you.’ Akemi nodded, continuing to pray. Melia echoed her, the words both strength and comfort. Yet her hand remained on her flamer. They walked on, their red boots clanging loudly. Desperate figures huddled away from them, crippled or mutated or both. Others turned as they passed, gaping in awe or astonishment. Still more narrowed their gazes, as if weighing the opportunity – then thought better of it and turned away. There were even those who tried to trade, bundles over their shoulders that they spread out, laden with scavenged treasures – machine parts, pict-slates, ancient fragments of forgotten weaponry. More than once, they saw a figure overwhelmed in a corner, and beaten casually to death. Nowhere were there soldiers, or any icons of either faith or authority. ‘By the Throne,’ Akemi said, her voice soft. ‘This place is a hell. It should be ended.’ ‘Why do they even come here?’ Viola asked. Istrix replied, her voice flat. ‘A place with no authority can be seen as an inviting prospect – somewhere that one can live without the restriction of rules. Outlaws and renegades, the lost, the unlucky, the mutant, the witch – all have rid themselves of the Emperor.’ Her voice curdled, sour with anger. ‘Here, they consider themselves free.’ ‘This is not freedom,’ Viola muttered, her tone edged with ferocity. She gestured with the bolter-muzzle, indicating their surroundings. ‘This is sacrilege.’ But Istrix turned sharply on her heel and faced them, making them stop. ‘I suggest you control yourself, Sister,’ she said, her voice flat. ‘I remind you again – you will take action only by my command.’ She held Viola’s gaze, stared her down. She turned to Augusta, making sure, then to Mors, one eyebrow raised. ‘Ave Imperator.’ The young man offered a salute, but he let his fist drop as soon as she’d turned away. The expressions of his squad, Melia noted, were less than properly schooled. They glanced at each other, silent stress shifting between them. Augusta was watching the inquisitor’s back. The Sister Superior’s expression was concealed by her helm, but her armoured shoulders seemed increasingly tense. It appeared, Melia thought, that there was more to Inquisitor Istrix than they’d realised. Staying close together, the group pushed onwards over the endless, groaning metal. It was fully dark, now, but the lumens were brighter and their light gleamed from the soldiers’ steaming breaths. The platforms were larger, better maintained, and many of the tanks and reactors had been repurposed as habitats or saloons. Smoke curled in the air – tabac sticks and kyxa weed. Coloured signs gleamed in darkened corners, ­making offers that made Lucio nudge his fellows and snicker. But Istrix did not care. She ignored the graffiti, scratched in mockery over the cogs and skulls of the original forge world; she ignored the sharp gazes of the curious opportunists, ignored the surrounding bodies, looted and rotting. She walked through all of it with her conviction blazing fearlessly, like an aura. The Sisters, in their scarlet armour, followed her, pushing through the grubby people like a wash of blood through rust. And the four soldiers walked with them, their eyes everywhere. At last, the inquisitor stopped. She indicated a large, cylindrical tank, standing alone at the platform’s outer edge – a smeltorium, perhaps, from the corroding pipes beneath. A sequence of binary code was carved into its outside. And below it, scratched into the metal, was the word, ‘Archeotech’. ‘Sssss.’ The noise might have been laughter, but it was mechanical, and oddly flat. In the dim illumination of the tank’s interior, a hooded figure sat in a defended seat, its back to the curve of the wall. Before it, the place was packed, all shouting and fighting and the pounding of scratch-built metal tables; the air stank of piss and spirits. The figure, however, did not raise its hood to look. On the other side of the table, Istrix stood solid, arms folded. The five Sisters flanked her like icons. Ranged with them, the Militarum soldiers seemed somewhat distracted. Lucio was looking around, and casting a wistful gaze at the battered metal mugs. Melia left him to it. Her attention was on the figure itself, and its mantled, augmetic limbs. A tech-priest. A renegade. Its cloak was black, shimmering with an oily glisten, and it bore a cog-symbol unfamiliar to the Sisters. Its limbs clicked and twitched; one claw pulled back its hood just enough to reveal a semi-human, female face, a single bright blue eye. Her other eye was an extending metal lens, glinting with a red, augmetic glare, and her mechadendrites rippled this way and that, scanning Istrix, the Sisters and the soldiers, and the bar in every direction. Satisfied with the data she had assembled, she sat back and hissed again, the noise like releasing steam. ‘Rayos.’ The inquisitor picked up a mug, eyed the contents, and clanked it back down on the table. ‘Inquisitor.’ The word was emotionless, emerging in ticks and whirs. ‘There has been an eighty-six point seven per cent chance that you would come, seeking my input.’ ‘Your information is excellent,’ Istrix said. It was statement, rather than question. ‘And I know about you, also – the heretek Vius was not alone in his desire to plunder the mysteries of Lycheate.’ The hood cocked to one side, the movement precise. ‘Vius is gone, his data held only in memory.’ The bar heaved and roared. From somewhere, there came singing, coarse and ragged like a shanty; the tables clattered in rhythm. Istrix said, ‘I wish to trade.’ Rayos let out another hiss. ‘My trade is forty-two point two per cent information, twenty-one point three per cent machine parts, and eleven point four per cent ores and minerals. The remainder can be defined as “unusual”, where that definition is taken from–’ ‘I’m looking for a man called Scafidis Zale,’ Istrix said, with a thin smile. ‘You either know where he is, or you can tell me where he may be found.’ The tech-priest sat back, her augmetic eye twisting as she focused upon Istrix’s face. ‘I can access this data,’ she said, at last. ‘But its release requires a very specific exchange.’ Istrix glanced pointedly at the Sisters that surrounded her, and leaned her knuckles on the table. The seemingly casual movement dropped her symbol from the front of her robes. It swayed there, glinting. ‘It’s not a request.’ The priest hissed again, the noise thoughtful. All of her mechadendrites had swivelled upwards to focus on the leaning figure. ‘You have…’ she paused, ‘…no authority here. And you do not have sufficient force of arms. Releasing this information may place my life at risk, and I will not offer you this data without a suitable reciprocal exchange.’ She turned away, as if the interview was closed. Melia found herself wondering if she’d try to throw them out. What binary messages were stealing out, even now, across the air? The Sister looked around for enforcers, but could see nothing obvious. ‘Inquisitor, with your permission?’ Augusta took a half-step forwards. Istrix nodded and stood upright, her arms folded. Augusta said, ‘Answer me, Rayos, yes or no – do you know the location of the witch?’ The priest turned back, raised her chin as if curious. ‘I can offer a ninety-seven point six per cent probability on where he may be found. These parameters are usually enough to assure accuracy.’ The Sister Superior paused, then said, ‘But you will not offer the information. Why can you not just tell us, Rayos? Does the heretic have some hold on you?’ ‘Sssss.’ The priest’s limbs were moving now, closing about her body as if to defend herself against assault. ‘My programming is uncorrupted. The Adepta Sororitas have no cause to assail me.’ Augusta paused, eyeing Rayos’ hood-shadowed, half-steel face. ‘We seek the witch,’ she said, ‘and we intend to find him.’ The Sister Superior’s hand was resting on her chainsword – whatever enforcers Rayos may have, she looked prepared to fight through all of them. Lucio had stopped looking around now, and the four Mili­tarum soldiers were paying tight attention. ‘The Sister Superior is correct,’ the inquisitor said. ‘We will see this mission completed.’ The roar of the bar clamoured round them; Melia laid her hand on her flamer, a prayer rising on her lips. But Rayos clicked and whirred, considering the pair of them. She leaned backwards in her chair, her limbs mantling higher. Then one claw pulled her black hood right off, revealing all of her once-human face, and the nest of augmetics that swarmed over it like a contagion. They stared. Rayos looked unclean, her flesh twisted and her metal corroding. As Melia suspected, she did not resemble any Mechanicus adept the Sisters had ever seen. In her remaining human cheek, her original cog-and-skull symbol had been obliterated by a long, red scar. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi commented, over the vox. ‘Must have been her home forge world.’ ‘What do you want?’ Istrix asked her. ‘In exchange for Zale’s location?’ Rayos’ mechadendrites flicked from the inquisitor to the Sister Superior and back, considering their unity and determination. Melia could almost imagine her assessing the information, calculating the threat. She said, ‘One of the Sororitas will remain with me until you have secured Scafidis Zale.’ ‘What?’ Augusta stepped forwards, her hands tightening on her weapons. ‘To what purpose?’ ‘As bodyguard,’ Rayos said. ‘If I reveal Zale’s location, there is a ninety-nine point six per cent chance that he will seek retribution. The Adepta Sororitas are known for faith that can defy witchery. This is my trade. If you wish to locate the heretic, you will grant me security.’ ‘We will make the deal.’ Istrix made a decisive gesture. ‘Sister Superior, one of your squad will volunteer.’ The words were an order. Augusta inhaled sharply, her armour creaking with the movement; Viola and Akemi exchanged a look. The priest wheezed again, a sound like straining bellows – she sounded almost like she was laughing. A clear space had spread out around the table and Melia could feel shadows lurking at its edges, bristling dark with threat. The Sister had no doubt that, if they turned on Rayos or tried to betray her, the resulting confrontation would be excessive. She heard herself say it: ‘I will stay.’ ‘Sister?’ Augusta turned, her face concerned. ‘I will stay,’ Melia said, again. ‘Sister Caia must remain with the inquisitor, and you will need Viola’s strength and Akemi’s knowledge. The success of this mission is the will of the Emperor,’ she kept her tone neutral, ‘and if I can serve Him best by remaining here, then I will do so.’ ‘You have great courage, Sister Melia,’ Istrix said, her smile thin and cold. ‘You have great courage,’ Augusta repeated. ‘To face this test alone is an act of both honour and bravery.’ She offered the sign of the aquila and a blessing. ‘Imperatoris vobiscum.’ Emperor be with you. The blue eye of the priest had observed the exchange with interest; the red one swivelled to focus on Melia, scanning her from head to foot. ‘The chances of successful retribution have lessened by a factor of three point three recurring – these parameters are acceptable. I must clarify accurate data. Inquisitor, Sister Superior, you will return here at 20:03:57, Solar time, when I will possess the information you require.’ ‘What guarantees do I have,’ Istrix said, ‘that you will not betray us?’ The priest placed her hood over her face and sat back, hissing. ‘You must calculate those odds,’ she said, ‘for yourself.’ Outside the repurposed tank, Augusta was finding herself increasingly disconcerted. They had been given no clear orders. They had walked blindly into an ambush. They were forbidden to open fire. And now this. Leaving a member of her squad behind was unthinkable – her Sisters fought, moved, as a unit. They had no Kimura, no Jatoya… And without Melia, they had no medicae, and no second. Augusta wondered why her Sister had volunteered, but the thought was too much. The Sister Superior was becoming more unsettled with every passing moment, with every order given and decision made… But, erratic behaviour or not, Istrix was the Emperor’s ­chosen, and her word was law. Levis est mihi. A prayer in her heart, Augusta walked like an automaton, her boots clanging with every step. Viola and Akemi flanked her like guards. The three of them stayed in tight formation as they followed Istrix back out onto the platform, and over towards the city. Ahead, Caia still walked with the inquisitor, but the set of the Sister’s red shoulders was tense. Melia was her closest friend, and it was easy to see that Caia was angry. At the back, the four Militarum soldiers stayed silent, as if they dared not make a sound. At the city limits, however, and demarked by a chain-link metal fence, a crowd had gathered to watch. Eyes hungry and gleeful were observing their every movement. As if they were waiting for something. They didn’t wait long. Caia’s warning and the single shot came almost simultaneously; Augusta saw Istrix jolt, then slump sideways like a broken thing. Caia shouted, ‘Up there!’ The corporal’s lasrifle streaked fire across the darkness. But, on the high walkway, the cloaked figure was already vanishing from sight. Viola’s weapon was drawn, covering the city; Augusta and Akemi both aimed their bolters at the tank’s entranceway. The Militarum bristled lasrifles at the higher gantries. Nothing moved. Stuck out in the open, the group was coverless, and alone. Gazes still watched them from the town, avid and curious. Augusta could almost feel them, mustering their courage, their hatred and their fear – they bulged with resentment like some mutated growth. But would they dare attack? Bolter still in hand, she drew the chainsword with the other. Daring them. Caia had dropped to one knee beside the inquisitor. ‘She’s alive,’ she said, bio-scanner in hand. ‘By the grace of the Emperor, she’s alive. We need Melia…’ She stopped, twisting her words to a halt. Rufus, one of the Militarum group, called, ‘Sister! I can help!’ Augusta gave a curt nod. ‘Go,’ the corporal told him, and the man ran forwards, pulling a medi-pack as he did so. Viola hadn’t moved; the muzzle of the heavy bolter still covered the crowd. Augusta could feel her fury; she was burning to pull the trigger. ‘Rayos must have betrayed us.’ Her tone was vicious. ‘This whole place stinks of corruption. We should go back in there and–’ ‘That is not our priority.’ Augusta cut her off. ‘Akemi, speak to Melia and secure her report. Corporal Mors, we need a defensible location. If the inquisitor dies while under our guard…’ Purposely, she let the implication hang. ‘Sister!’ Viola’s protest was angry. ‘Rayos–’ ‘Sister Viola!’ Augusta’s tone was a bark. ‘The inquisitor is alive. She is the word of the Emperor, and she must take precedence.’ She looked at her squad. ‘We will not abandon Sister Melia. But we need security – and now. Akemi, what’s the report from the Archeotech?’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I can’t reach Melia on the vox – I’m getting static.’ Throne! Augusta stopped herself cursing aloud. She was caught, thinking, praying, her whole body was alert with adrenaline – she could not abandon a member of her squad, but nor could she leave the injured inquisitor out in the open. A prayer curled in her heart; she needed guidance, under-standing… Levis est mihi… Show me to the Light! She had to make the decision. She said, ‘Keep trying. Mors – how well do you know the area? Can you find us a safe location?’ ‘I believe so, Sister,’ the corporal said. He had his rifle in hand, still scanning the upper catwalks. ‘The Mechanicus construct these platforms in repeating and regular patterns, and I know where one may be found.’ ‘Good man,’ Augusta said to him. ‘We will follow your lead. Can the inquisitor be moved?’ ‘The Emperor is with her, Sister Superior.’ Rufus was on his knees and holding a dressing to Istrix’s shoulder. ‘The wound is serious, but treatable. The hydrostatic shock has robbed her of consciousness. I can revive her–’ ‘Not here.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ The city’s crowd was getting larger now; they were starting to shift and seethe. Viola made a deliberate show of re-cocking the heavy bolter, the noise echoing from the tank like a challenge. Akemi kept her weapon trained on the tank’s hatch, though the bar had remained silent. Her voice in the vox continued, but there was no response to the call. Augusta checked her annoyance, and gave her orders. ‘Corporal, take point. Sister Caia, with the corporal. I will carry the inquisitor myself. Viola, guard our backs – and if anything tries to attack us, shoot it.’ Viola said, ‘Aye,’ and the word was like a promise of violence. They moved, low to the ground and at the double. Caia’s scanning enhanced the corporal’s local instincts and they made good speed, skirting the outer edges of the city and climbing down towards the lower platforms. It was darker down here, the lumens faltering, but it offered at least basic concealment. Suspended walkways creaked over the reeking water; the group moved as fast as it dared, all suit-lights turned off. The unconscious inquisitor hung in Augusta’s arms like a sacrifice, her scars glinting. She was heavy, but the Sister Superior’s power armour was enough to bear her easily. In the vox, Augusta offered a prayer – for Melia, for Istrix’s health and recovery. And for herself, for insight, for His wisdom to show her the way… Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… This mission was not turning out how they had expected. Soon, they left the noise of the town behind them. They could clearly hear their own boots and breathing, the hiss and seethe of the hungry, polluted waters. And, as they walked, Augusta’s prayers focused her thoughts, and she began to understand something. The Sister Superior did not doubt Istrix’s authenticity, nor her dedication to her target, yet still, her choices of action seemed odd. She came across as arrogant, though perhaps that was not so unusual. And she had willingly walked them out from the Munitorum depot, and straight into the nearest ambush… For what? So she could locate Rayos? Rayos herself had seemed genuine enough – a local boss, manipulating the people and powers around her to her own best advantage. Augusta had encountered such creatures before. She– ‘Here!’ The corporal’s deep voice sounded in the vox. ‘No movement,’ Caia confirmed, auspex back in her hand. ‘That doesn’t mean it’s empty,’ Augusta commented. ‘Secure the area.’ ‘Aye.’ Caia nodded at the corporal, and his heavy boot hammered the metal door. It spanked back against the side of the lift shaft, and Caia brought up her bolter to cover the space. Within was a cargo-lift, more than big enough to accommodate all of them, and with the added advantage of a second exit on the opposite side. Caia counted five and said, ‘Clear!’ ‘Very well, then,’ Augusta said. ‘We will regroup, and reload.’ As they moved in, and laid the inquisitor down, Rufus moved forward with his kit, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘She’s stable, yes?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then why don’t we let her sleep for a moment?’ Her tone was grim. ‘Keep an eye on her. Corporal Mors, I’ll need your full report.’ If this mission was to succeed, then the Sister Superior wanted to know everything.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX Sister Melia sat with her back to the old smeltorium’s wall, the rigid metal scraping against the edges of her armour. Beside her, Rayos paid her no further attention, hissing and clicking over the pile of trade-pieces and data-slates that had been left on her table. Some she passed to the little brass analyser beside her; others were carefully measured with callipers and claws. Her cogitator clicked away to itself, presumably keeping some sort of running tally. Melia watched, oddly fascinated, and wondered what information flowed between the two of them. In her heart, however, she offered the Litany of Divine Guidance; she prayed for strength, and for clarity. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. And then, the bar went quiet. Melia looked up. A lone figure had pushed through the crowd, stilling fights and rowdy singing both. He was strong and tanned, gold-eyed and brown-haired. He wore no armour, no symbols; he carried no weapons. Yet he commanded his audience with a flourish like pure confidence. As he came closer, Melia could feel a pressure swelling in her mind, like creepers growing through her ears. She continued to pray. As if he could hear her, the man met her gaze. He had a smile that gave him tan-lines, crinkles round his eyes that offered humour, warmth and mischief. ‘Sister,’ he said, as he stopped at the table. ‘How charming.’ She lifted her chin; the pressure in her mind was growing worse. Her skull spasmed with agony, aching like it would split. Somewhere, she could hear the hissing of the Lautis daemons, feel their flame and fear– The priest raised a claw. ‘Desist.’ The man laughed, and the pressure was gone. Witch! Shuddering with revulsion, Melia was on her feet. She knew what had happened, knew exactly what – who – this man was. And she understood, in the very next instant, that Rayos had betrayed them, that she’d never had any intention of going through with the deal. Melia’s hand went for her flamer; she opened a channel in the vox but the signal was blocked. The bead in her ear crackled static. Weapon out, she pointed it at the newcomer. ‘Heretic!’ ‘Really, Sister.’ The man laughed. His tone was like his clothing, rich and warm. ‘The word is so crass, don’t you think? Please, call me Zale. And you will stand when I say, sit when I say, kneel when I say. Now put that away, and be quiet.’ With each word, Melia’s body jerked in response; she obeyed him like a marionette, her strings in his hands. As he gave the final order, however, she spat a prayer and surged forwards. One hand turned the table clean over, mugs and data-slates clattering to the floor; the other shoved the flamer right in his face. At the noise, there was an instant of silence, then whoops and cheers erupted around the bar. The man’s eyes narrowed, as if she’d surprised him. But he made no attempt to defend himself, or back away. ‘I wouldn’t,’ he told her softly, ‘if I were you.’ His eyes glittered; she could see whole worlds held in them, the sparkle of stars, the vast streams of the empyrean. The screaming, bloody heave of the warp that she’d seen through the mirror in the Lautis cathedral… Worlds, dying at the touch of Chaos. Softly, he said, ‘I know you have no fear of death, Sister. I know you would lay down your life to slay me, and everything else in this establishment. But I also know how this ends.’ Moons exploded in her vision; his words stroked her, their truth enthralling. ‘Istrix is a lunatic, you must have realised that by now.’ ‘She is a child of the Emperor.’ Melia snarled the words; her flamer hadn’t moved. ‘You spin treachery and illusion to gain your own ends. I will not suffer your life–’ ‘Sister, please,’ he said. Smiling, he raised a hand and pushed the weapon down and out of the way. ‘That’s quite enough. If I told you to, you would strip off your armour and bathe in the waters of Lycheate like they were a font.’ Melia reeled, staggering and silent. The words were a lance of pain in her forebrain, a white-hot flare going off behind her eyes. She fell back onto the bench. Beside her, Rayos had stood up, and a delicate, unfolding claw was picking up her fallen goods. Secreting some of the higher-value pieces in places under her cloak, she said to Zale, ‘Our trade is concluded. You have the item you require. I will depart. I will not return to this location, the percentage chance of retaliation is unacceptable. I will join you at the requested appointment. We will conclude our business.’ ‘Of course.’ Zale offered her a bow like a flourish, then turned back to Melia. He extended his arm as if he expected her to take it. And Melia found herself obeying the gesture, her body moving like a servitor’s, clumsy and painful. She fought to clear her thoughts. She wanted to demand: what appointment, what business? She wanted to pull her flamer, execute this smirking heretic, this betraying tech-priest. She wanted to howl the hymnal aloud, to purge this world of its faithless and its unbelievers… But she could not; her head hurt and her limbs ground like rust. She tried to pray, struggled to recall the words. ‘Domine… libra…’ They came forth in pieces, in shards of pain through her hard-clenched teeth. ‘I feel your battle,’ Zale told her, smiling. Explosions were still going off in her head – the moons detonating, over and over again, their pieces spinning, spinning in the void. ‘But you’re weak, Melia, unsure of your own strength and position. You know this.’ He chuckled, the sound lush. ‘Please understand, Istrix and I go back a very long way, and I can usually… shall we say, predict… her moves.’ His words were sharply amused, as if at some private joke. ‘But the Adepta Sororitas? Now, that’s a ploy I hadn’t expected. And one that’s interesting, a genuine challenge.’ He picked up one of the metal mugs, drained its contents, put it down again. ‘And so, I had to have you – my security, my coin, my Imperial scrip. The card up my sleeve, if you like.’ His smile grew. ‘And, close-up, I can learn how your mind, your foolish faith, really works, Sister – and understand how to better the rest of your squad.’ Melia’s mind was fraying like old cloth. Her prayers were fading, her vision was full of detonations, and wonder, and beauty, and Ruin, and pain… She made herself speak, each word like a splinter of agony. ‘My life… will not save you. The Sisters of Battle… will not… be defeated. My squad… will shoot you.’ ‘Really?’ he said, and his brown eyes glittered like rusted manacles. ‘I think you’ll find… it’s just not that simple.’ ‘Sister Superior, I am under orders…’ Inside the lift, the corporal tailed into an uneasy silence, eyeing the fallen inquisitor. ‘To disobey those orders would be heresy. I would be shot. Or confined to the life of a gun-servitor–’ ‘The question is not difficult,’ Augusta said. They were short of time, and she needed Mors’ full story, needed to try to understand why the inquisitor’s behaviour was so peculiar. ‘I asked for your report. Where do you come from, Mors? How do you come to be on Lycheate? And how long have you been with Istrix?’ Leaving Caia and Viola on watch, Augusta and Akemi stood with their backs to the lift wall. Opposite them, on a long metal bench, the four members of the Militarum had stood down, and broken out their rations. They were sharing a canteen of water, and even Lucio had run out of banter. Rufus, the medicae and the oldest of the four, sat the closest to Istrix. He said, ‘Sister Superior, with all due respect…’ ‘Corporal,’ Augusta said, cutting straight across his words. ‘You will answer the question.’ The corporal had removed his helmet; despite the cold air, his dark skin glittered with sweat. He muttered something that might have been a prayer, then let out his breath in a plume like surrender. Swiftly, he explained how they had met Istrix when she had been scouting the planet for her quarry. She had been unaccompanied, working alone, and assaulted at the outskirts of the city. They had gone to help her, and she had immediately commanded their assistance in locating Zale. Several days later, after a short battle during which their lieutenant had lost his life, they’d cornered, and successfully wounded, the psyker. But Zale’s wound had been an illusion, the corporal told them. The witch had lured them in, and the battle had cost the life of the sergeant and of the other members of the squad. ‘Zale is extremely powerful,’ Mors said. ‘The illusions he creates are truly horrifying. Our squad… barely stood a chance.’ He trailed off into silence, frowning. ‘She didn’t fire.’ Adriene, her legs stretched out across the lift floor, looked up from her ration pack. ‘She had him, at gunpoint, out on the gantry, and she didn’t shoot him. She–’ ‘Private!’ the corporal snapped at her, cutting her dead. Augusta turned back to Mors. ‘Corporal, you will give me your full report, everything you’ve seen while you’ve been with the inquisitor.’ Her gaze did not let him go. ‘The success of this mission may depend upon your information.’ Mors paused for a moment, then he inhaled and straightened his shoulders. ‘Our squad died screaming,’ he said. ‘The inquisitor…’ His voice shook, he swiftly controlled himself. ‘Istrix hesitated, and the gantry collapsed. We lowered a line and pulled her free, but by then, Zale had already gone. Emperor forgive me, Sister, Adriene is correct – she had him at gunpoint, and she did not fire.’ Augusta nodded, but said nothing more aloud. Over their private channel, she continued, ‘Sisters. What do you make of this?’ ‘He seems terrified,’ Akemi said. ‘They all do.’ ‘He’s not telling us everything,’ Caia commented. Viola suggested, ‘We can force it out of him.’ Augusta replied, ‘We will do no such thing–’ She stopped as feet raced past outside; they all turned, hands on weapons. The rasp of an engine sounded at the waterline. ‘Very well,’ Augusta said. ‘We have not secured Sister Melia, and I fear we are out of time.’ She eyed Mors for a moment, then looked down at the unconscious inquisitor, her gaze exploring the careful latticework of scars. ‘One last question. You say she did not shoot Zale. So, why did Zale not end her life? He must have had the opportunity.’ Adriene frowned at her rations, Lucio counted his ammo. ‘He used to be her pupil,’ Mors said, and Augusta nodded. ‘And there still seems to be some… strange connection between them, Sister, some compulsion or madness that drives them both–’ ‘Corporal.’ Augusta’s voice was steel. ‘Has she fallen?’ At the question, Mors drew in his breath, and the others stopped to stare, their gazes wide. Carefully, the corporal said, ‘I have seen nothing to prove so, Sister. Only her… singular devotion to securing her target.’ Augusta exhaled, her prayer tangling round her exasperation. If the inquisitor had fallen to Ruin, then the Sisters’ path would have been clear, but still they had no explanation for Istrix’s peculiar behaviour. The Sister Superior had a need for guidance, for His light that had shown her Subul, and the way to the daemon… Domine deduc… But there was no clarity, here, no definite answer. Frustrated, she let her hand rest on her chainsword, solid and strong. More than anything, she wanted to hear the song of its rasp, to solve these endless questions with the glory of the litany and the roar of pure combat… By the Throne! All her life, Augusta had trusted to two things – her faith, and her weapons. And, all her life, they had been the same – she raised her voice to the God-Emperor, and she slew His foes. But this! She was beginning to believe that Istrix did not intend the witch’s death – and everything in the Sister Superior’s training baulked at that knowledge. The witch should be purged. He needed to die. Yet Mors was right, there seemed to be some deeper game here, some twisted, emotional connection that she did not understand. It made Istrix dangerous, unpredictable – and it brought the entire success of the mission into doubt. Had Istrix fallen to the darkness? She would not be the first inquisitor to have been consumed by the powers she pursued. But if Istrix was the presence of the God-Emperor, then her word was law, and to open fire upon her would be pure heresy. Augusta and her entire squad would offer their lives in Repentance. Somewhere, the Sister Superior could still feel the jagged edges of her darkness – see the stikk-bomb that had slain Kimura, the clang of the axe that had broken Jatoya like a doll. Melia, volunteering to stay with Rayos. Upon Ordination, the Sisters of her Order offered a prayer… ‘Imperator illam possedit me precor. In omnibus meis actionibus et officiorum. Omnium cogitationes et opera. Et ego armis exceptus…’ Emperor, I pray that you will utterly possess me. In all of my duties and actions. In all of my thoughts and deeds. I am your weapon and your vessel… Guide me, my Emperor, she prayed. I cannot get this wrong. With the words, she lifted her chin, and made her decision. Yes, she must follow the inquisitor’s orders… But she did not intend to do so blindly. ‘Corporal,’ she said. ‘You withstood Zale’s mental assault, correct?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘You will run reconnaissance on the smeltorium, and locate Sister Melia. Your squad will stay with me. If you are right about this connection, then Zale will be closer than we think.’ The corporal saluted. ‘Aye.’ ‘Remember, corporal, this is recon, not a combat mission. Do not call attention to yourself, and do not engage. Stick to the upper levels. Return to the smeltorium, and watch.’ ‘Aye.’ She nodded, approving of this young man, his choices and his discipline. ‘Go with His grace, corporal. And return with His wisdom.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ He offered her a salute. As he slipped out of the far door of the cargo lift, however, he turned back. ‘Sister Superior,’ he said. ‘I do have… one last suspicion.’ ‘Go on.’ ‘It is my belief,’ he said, ‘that Zale is up to something. I think he’s here for a reason.’ ‘Then we will prevent that reason,’ Augusta told him flatly. ‘One way or another, the witch must die.’ He was in her head. Like a burrower, like the stain of Chaos. Like the fear wielded by the Lautis daemons. Like a necron scarab, its claws scratch-scratching with the taint of steel and death. Stubbornly, Melia held to her chant, the litany – like her novitiate childhood – both comfort and reflex. She had been taught this as a girl, kneeling beside her dormitorium bunk and praying to that tiny, carved effigy… she knew how to face fear, how to surpass witchery. And yet it still lingered, like an ache in the back of her skull. Images tumbled like the edges of rocks. She was in the belly of the Kyrus, in command of the squad. Kimura was there, and Jatoya; they described a perfect skirmish manoeuvre along the flickering-dark corridor. Domine, libra nos… Words lingered like hope, but she could not quite grasp them. The Sisters moved onwards, the font-waters of Lycheate sloshing at their feet. Bodies bobbed past them – Sister Felicity Albani, the missionary Tanichus, the tech-priest Jencir, his flayed skull all covered in blood. Phantoms rose from her past, and they laughed like Scafidis Zale, lush and rich and warm. You are to blame, Melia. Jatoya was twice the warrior you are. Look at your errors! Look at them! In the Kyrus’ corridor, she saw the bomb. She went to cry out, but it was too late – the detonation was colossal, and the flame was livid and hungry for life. The impact of it threw her backwards. Debris creaked and screamed; her visor was smudged with smoke. There was a hole ripped in the side of the ship – it was injured and in pain, crying out. She tried to pray for it, but she was not the priest it needed, and Rayos laughed at her ignorance. The wind shrieked past her, wreckage and bodies all sucked out into the void. She caught a last look at Jatoya’s face as the Sister scrabbled madly at the wounded metal, and was gone. The woman’s still-armoured body spun outwards into nothing, and her voice cried the Requiem. Dies Irae, Dies Illa! +You did this,+ Zale told her. +You failed. You’re weak, inadequate. The Emperor does not want you, Melia. You do not deserve Him. And you know it!+ She held to her hymn, angry, stubborn, refusing to give up. She filled her mind with the chapel on Ophelia VII, with His image, His light. She cried denial, her defiance loud: ‘Thou shalt not suffer the witch to live!’ With a crack like the split in a window, the image splintered, and was gone. Startled, she blinked. Her head was pounding. She was still in the bar. Scafidis Zale was before her with his arms folded, and one elegant eyebrow raised. ‘Impressive,’ he said, the word almost a compliment. ‘You’re going to take more of my concentration than I’d realised.’ She faced him, continuing to recite the litany. She repeated the words like a lifeline, over and over, wreathed in anger and defiance. ‘Domine, libra nos. ‘Domine, libra nos…’ ‘Makes a change to name, rank, and serial number, I suppose.’ He laughed at his own humour, then chewed the inside of his lip, thinking. ‘Domine, libra nos…’ ‘You listen to me, Sister Melia.’ He stepped forwards, cupping her cheek in his hand with a gesture that seemed almost affectionate. He bore several rings and his gold eyes shone like Sol itself. ‘We are going to take a little walk, and explore some of the glories that this planet has to offer. Not its people – you’ve already seen too many of those – but its secrets. Some of the things that the Mechanicus believed broken, and that the heretek Vius, in his cleverness and his determination, managed to discover. The things that Rayos has been… moving… for me.’ He stroked his thumb over her cheek. ‘You may fight me if you wish, Sister, but the outcome will be the same. Your Emperor cannot save you.’ His smile was pure charm. ‘Not from me.’ ‘Domine, libra nos.’ Melia kept praying as the images broke over her again.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The stimm brought Istrix upright in a rush, her face pale, her green eyes briefly wild. She took in her surroundings with a single, blazing-cold glance, and came straight to her feet. She swayed, her hand going to her field-dressing, and her missing pauldron. Instinctively, Rufus offered her assistance but she refused. Outrage flared from her shoulders as she turned around. She snapped, ‘Where is Corporal Mors?’ Augusta replied, ‘I sent him on reconnaissance.’ ‘What?’ The inquisitor spun back to her. ‘Are you deficient, Sister? I did not give you leave to take the initiative. To make my decisions for me. You disobey an order of mine again, and you will find yourself wielding a very different selection of weaponry.’ A flicker of spittle flew from her lips as she thundered, ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘Ma’am.’ Startled by her vehemence, Augusta offered her a curt salute, but Istrix had already turned away, scornfully dismissive, to retrieve her shoulder-armour. Her voice in the vox demanded the corporal’s immediate return, and on the double. The Sister Superior held herself still. Mors had given her new questions to consider, but as yet, she did not know the answers. Beside her, Akemi shifted uncomfortably, her armour creaking; the soldiers were exchanging uneasy glances, though they said nothing. But Istrix paid none of them the slightest attention. Instead, as she fastened her pauldron back into place, her gaze fell on the ration-crumbs, and narrowed. ‘How long,’ she asked them, the words like cracking ice, ‘did you leave me unconscious?’ ‘Moments only.’ Augusta offered a penitent prayer to accompany the lie. ‘We roused you as soon–’ ‘But long enough to pause for a rest?’ Istrix’s tone was savage. ‘Ma’am–’ ‘Enough!’ The inquisitor silenced the Sister Superior with a bark that was almost a bellow. Her face was flushed, now, showing the neat lines of scars. She looked like she would split along those lines, detonating into flying fragments of furious flesh. Augusta inhaled. She prayed for calm, and for clarity. For truth. ‘We will hold this location until Mors returns,’ the inquisitor said, her sarcasm as bitter and lethal as a lake of acid. ‘And then we will move out for our meeting with Rayos.’ ‘Inquisitor, we do not know that Rayos can be trusted.’ Privately, Augusta thanked the Emperor Himself for her years of training, for the canoness’ strict discipline that enabled her to keep her voice controlled. ‘We cannot reach Sister Melia. And, dependent upon Mors’ intelligence, I suggest that an assault upon the tech-priest’s location would be the best option.’ ‘I have already told you, Sister.’ Istrix ground crumbs under her boot. ‘You will not open fire without my orders.’ Viola tensed; Augusta could see the young woman’s gauntleted hands tighten on the heavy bolter, though she did not turn around. ‘When this mission is over,’ Istrix continued, ‘I will be accompanying you back to Ophelia VII. I will be commanding an audience with your canoness, and I will be delivering my report on your performance and behaviour… in person.’ Augusta was beginning to feel the same sharp, furious sense of helplessness that she’d felt in the shuttle, the same sense of being tumbled by forces outside her control. And, down here, she liked it even less. ‘Corporal Mors, incoming.’ The man’s voice was accompanied by the impact of boots on the top of the lift. Weapons twitched; Istrix gave one of the soldiers a curt nod. Smoothly, Adriene stood on the bench to open the hatch, while Rufus and Lucio raised their rifles for cover. ‘Clear,’ she said. Mors’ long figure dropped into the lift, his rifle over his shoulder. Istrix waited for him, arms folded. ‘Well?’ ‘Ma’am.’ He glanced from inquisitor to Sister, and offered a salute. ‘Your hunch was correct, Sister. Rayos has betrayed us, and Zale was at the smeltorium.’ Istrix bridled, pulling herself up to her full height. ‘Go on, corporal,’ Augusta said. ‘We saw Zale speak to Rayos and leave, heading towards the other side of the city. He had back-up, two armed city thugs, and he had Sister Melia with him. She was unhurt, though she seemed to be dazed.’ In the vox, Viola commented darkly, ‘Told you so.’ ‘Viola.’ Augusta’s disciplinary bark was sharp. ‘That’s enough.’ The younger Sister shifted again, but said nothing. Another issue: Viola had a strong will, and stronger opinions. She’d disobeyed her orders once before. And with the increasing pressure that Istrix was placing upon the squad… This was all going to detonate, and soon. The Sister Superior said, ‘We should target them now, inquisitor. The heretic must die.’ Mors glanced from face to face, as if trying to understand the tension. His expression was pained. Her orders had already killed his squadmates – presumably he was wondering if she would end up killing all of them. ‘We’ve got another problem,’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Incoming cityside.’ Outside the cargo-lift, the city’s shifting, curious crowd was closing on the Sisters’ location. A glut of filthy figures – many of them deformed or subhuman – were weapons-in-hands and loitering, their grins eager. Their leader looked orkish, big and green and tusked; its face was half metal and it wore a freebooter’s distinctive hat. There were soldiers, worn ragged, gangers in various muddy colours, knots of mutants with robes and appendages, and at least one of the shadowy Mechanicus renegades, all cloaked and clawed. Its visible flesh was stained and rotting, and it was flanked by the scuttle and rumble of clumsy servitors. The group looked ramshackle, but determined. ‘They must have followed the corporal,’ Istrix said. The words were cutting, and pointedly aimed at Augusta. ‘I fear, ma’am,’ Augusta returned, ‘that our force has been all too visible. They’re scavengers, they must be after our wargear.’ Viola added, ‘And the reputation to go with it.’ ‘We should attack,’ Augusta said, again. ‘We must eliminate Zale before we lose him.’ ‘We will move out,’ Istrix told her shortly, ‘and we will follow Zale’s route. But we will not engage him – not yet. I want to know where he’s going.’ When they moved, the crowd from the city followed them. Not close, but close enough. The people – if that’s what they were – carried anger and fear, a rising need to obliterate or control these icons of Imperial faith that had landed in their midst. The swell of them came on like a slow ripple of hunger, the freebooter ork at the centre. Augusta knew that they were no match for four fully-armed Sisters, backed by the lasrifles of the Militarum soldiers, but they seemed content to hang back, and they made good use of the local cover. It seemed like they were waiting for something – some signal to attack. Yet Istrix still didn’t care; still, she was focused only forwards. She kept moving, and she left the fully armed horde, loitering, at their backs. With every junction they passed, Augusta’s frustration grew stronger. Powerful priorities pulled the Sister Superior in opposite directions – to doubt the inquisitor was heresy, and yet those doubts grew with every moment. Augusta needed to stop and think and pray; to follow her faith, and her honour. To follow His Guidance. Yet it seemed even more lost here than it had been in the catacombs of the Lautis cathedral. Is she Your vessel? Or is she corrupt? Istrix’s forward motion remained utterly, obsessively relentless. Behind Augusta, Sister Viola walked at the rear, her heavy bolter daring the crowd to come closer. Caia stayed in the lead, auspex and weapon both in hand; Akemi still flanked the Sister Superior. The youngest Sister’s fingers twitched, as though she missed her little silver fetish. To Augusta, this was looking more and more crazed – perhaps Mors had been right, and this was all some elaborate game… Everything has an Operandus. The lesson she had been teaching her Sisters – but if there was a pattern here, then she still could not see it. Behind them, the horde hung back, mocking. They loosed the occasional shout, pieces of chants like the edges of some violent promise. They still kept their distance, but Augusta knew: if they saw the right opportunity, they would surge forwards and tear the inquisitor’s entire retinue to screaming, bloody pieces… Or – and the Sister Superior laid her hand on her chain­sword – they’d make the attempt. The group moved on. Soon, they passed a familiar bottleneck – walkway, tank and crane, all identical to the previous layout. It bore an embossed numerical sequence in exactly the same place, and the scored-out cog-symbol of Triplex Phall. Augusta said, her tone short, ‘We should hold this location, inquisitor. If we take a stand here–’ ‘We will keep moving.’ Istrix did not even bother to pause. ‘I have already said – I need to know where they’re going.’ Under her breath, Augusta let herself curse. But the inquisitor’s boots did not stop. They clanged onwards, continuing with her inexorable, headlong march. It seemed as though some fierce, white flame pulled her, some need she would not stoop to explain. The Sister Superior was becoming more and more convinced that the inquisitor’s mission was not just the will of the Emperor. Like Viola, she felt rising frustration; she wanted to loose her rage at the dirty brown sky, to open fire at last, to sing until this entire ruined world knew the wrath of the Emperor Himself, and of His Adepta Sororitas… ‘Inquisitor,’ she said. ‘A question.’ Istrix answered her with a short laugh, a snort as cold as the frozen air. She said, her tone almost patronising, ‘You wish to know about Zale?’ She glanced back, her odd smile making her scars crease and wrinkle. ‘I have been chasing him a very long time. He knows he cannot overpower me, either physically or psychically. He is not strong enough to face me himself. So, I think he’s found himself another force.’ Another force. By the Throne! With an effort, the Sister Superior stopped herself swearing aloud. ‘Something must be left here…’ The words were Akemi’s, though Istrix did not react to her outspokenness. ‘Something like the Breacher. Something that the Mechanicus forgot, or overlooked.’ The inquisitor said nothing; she seemed too intent upon the realisation of her goal. ‘Which explains,’ Augusta commented, ‘why he was dealing with Rayos. She must have found something, uncovered something…’ The remainder of her sentence remained unspoken: And we have walked straight into this… you are walking us straight into this… ‘So, we’re expecting an ambush?’ Viola echoed her thought, her voice edged with fervour. Augusta felt an urge to grin – the release of pure combat would be welcome – but she had to keep her head. This was insane. They were surrounded. They had enemies both ahead and behind. And if there was a force ahead of them, then they had no idea of its armament or capability. And yet, they would just walk straight into its centre? Was Istrix that fixated with Scafidis Zale? Augusta noticed the corporal frowning. He caught her looking and turned away, lifting his chin and flattening his expression. Her suspicion and annoyance peaked. In the Emperor’s name, this was idiocy. ‘Inquisitor,’ she said, trying again. ‘We must remove the threat at our backs. If we are expecting battle–’ ‘Sister. Superior.’ The words were a nasty hiss and Istrix stopped dead, turning sharply on her heel and coming back to face Augusta, her expression incensed. ‘Your continued insubordination is intolerable. If you question my decisions one more time, I will execute you for heresy, right here and right now.’ Specks of froth flew from the corners of her mouth as she ­thunder­ed, ‘Do you understand?’ ‘Ma’am.’ Augusta controlled her shock; she stayed still, held her ground. She felt her squad shift, tense and startled. She could see Akemi’s wide-eyed expression; feel Viola’s silent surge of outrage. See the corporal’s frown returning. ‘Hold strong.’ Her voice in the vox was soft, but still an order. ‘Sisters, with me… It Imperator, docere patientia mea. Docete me observationis. Docete me de hostibus meis scientia.’ Emperor, teach me patience. Teach me observation. Teach me the knowledge of my enemies. It was the Litany of Learning – one from the schola, and not usually something sung in the field. But, her mind aflare with the sudden idea, she continued to the correct stanza… ‘Ut plene intelligere, quod de ratione tuum hostes Tuos, et adducere ut ut iustitia Tua.’ That I may understand fully the nature of Your foes, and that I may bring them to Your justice. Under the visor, she saw Akemi’s face relax, saw the faintest flicker as the youngest Sister caught her meaning. Viola’s rage began to ease. They joined her in the hymn, Caia too. Their voices were soft, their harmonies perfect and pure. And it was enough. August felt herself relax – He was with them. And her suspicions had been conveyed, properly and discreetly; her squad would be wary, and would be alert for her orders. Much as her every military nerve told her to disobey the fanatical inquisitor, she still – absolutely – could not. Their suspicion and their unity would have to be enough. Until the Emperor chose to make His wishes clear. Melia clung to herself with the very edges of her strength and her faith, resisting the yawning chasm. In her mind, a single image: the great, stained glassaic window in the chapel of her Order. In her throat, a single litany: From the blasphemy of the fallen… Zale had rounded up a couple of gangers and had taken her from the smeltorium, out past the back of the city and up, always up, along the higher levels and the platforms of the city’s outskirts. She’d stumbled after him, all her focus and energy going into keeping him from controlling her mind; nothing left to stop herself being propelled forwards by a rust-smelling oaf on either side. She could only repeat the thing that held her sanity, her lifeline, over and over again. Domine, libra nos. He had her in his mental grip like she were a bolt, gripped by a tech-priest, like she were a round, caught in the chamber of her own weapon. She held on, but only just. Around her, the landscape of Lycheate slowly changed. She was only dimly aware of it – an ongoing blur of dust and oxidation at the outsides of her vision – but the platforms were opening out now, becoming much larger and offering landing pads, turning tables, and huge, mecha-scaffolds. There were colossal lifts, rusted into their shafts, titanic cranes that stretched skywards, creaking in the cold night wind. Wherever they were going, it was going to be vast. +Curious, are you?+ His voice sounded in her head. It was the warmth of it that was the hardest thing – the soft coax that said trust me, I am here for you. She did not respond. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. In among Lycheate’s steelworks, she could see flickers of phantom-images. The death-green glow of the necrons on Psamitek; the clicking seethe of the tyranids that she and Caia had faced on their very first mission out of the schola. She saw Caia die, over and over, yet she knew that it had never happened. She saw the Lautis orks tear her Sister to pieces, saw the daemon’s flesh hounds bite into her limbs and worry at them, ripping them free from their sockets and gnawing on the bones. She saw that Caia was still alive as they did so, watching her own arms and legs being dragged, bloody, out through the nave of the ruined cathedral. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. She saw the Convent Sanctorum on Ophelia VII; saw the canoness hit the floor as the first detonations rocked the building. She was running though the cloisters, her robes, red and black and white, flapping behind her. She was calling for her Sisters to do battle – but they refused her authority. They did not recognise her, and even as the dark blurs of warships robbed the light from the windows, she knew that the failure was her own. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. ‘Here.’ It took her a moment to realise that Zale had spoken aloud. Her head was so full of the destruction of the convent that she had to blink to realise that she stood in bright, magnesium-white lumens, and that the space around her was colossal, draughty and absolutely ice-cold. Wherever they were, it was taking enough of Zale’s attention that she could grind her gaze into focus and look round. By His Holy Light! She barely had the wit to keep the exclamation to herself, to remain reciting the litany so he had no suspicion. She was not a good dissembler – it was lying, dishonourable – but a pure mote of sense told her to keep her awareness concealed. If she could. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. They stood at the upper balcony of a huge, half-collapsed factorum. Below them, the floor stretched out into darkness. Its machines were silent, rows and rows of production lines, all dead and rusted into place. There were shrines and pict-screens at their ends, data towers that stretched towards the crumbling roof, fallen grav-pallets where products could be stacked and – presumably – taken to the hauler stations outside. This was where the life of the planet’s doomed moons had once been manifest upon its surface, the place where the tech-priests had rolled out their forces… And those forces were still here. Once lost. Now rediscovered. She could see them, lurking at the factorum’s edges, silent and rust-splotched, but looming huge in the shadows… the forgotten fighting machines of the departed Adeptus Mechanicus. Kataphrons – Destroyers and Breachers. Lines of kastelans. Waiting. This, she realised, was the place where Rayos would be meeting him. To offer her prayers to the Omnissiah – however a heretek would see Him… And to bring this force to life. A breath escaped her, a plume of white with which she gave herself away. ‘Awake, are we?’ Zale turned like some now-benign conqueror, opening his hands to let her witness his triumph. ‘And for just long enough to see what I have found here, and what I can muster. When Istrix comes for me – because she will, she has no choice – when she comes for me, this will be the very last thing she sees.’ +Finally!+ She heard his words in her head. +And I want her to witness this, Sister. I want her to know just how badly she’s failed. I need her to see this force, and to understand what I will do with it… +I need her last thought to be despair.+ His mental tones were gleeful, full of exultant celebration. And the images closed over her again with the rush of Lycheate’s filthy waters – and, this time, they came with the call of the moons’ distress signal, and the grind and batter that was pure, machine war. ‘You want…’ drowning, she struggled to find the words, ‘…revenge on your mistress…’ +Not just my mistress, Sister.+ His tone was deep, liquid-soft, and utterly lethal. +Like the heretek Vius before me, my call will reach out across the void.+ He smiled like the sun coming up. +I want all of them.+ She didn’t understand him, not clearly; the confusion was too great. Even the litany was fading now, as if he had rent it clean from her mind, thrown it down like some damaged convent tapestry, all torn to shreds. +Here we are,+ he said. +At last!+",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT The heights of the planet Lycheate were bitterly cold, and Augusta’s visor kept clogging with the icy dust. Up here, the great steelworks creaked and graunched; the walkways were thinner, and much more precarious. In places, they rounded the edges of the huge pipes like some poorly fenced steel precipice, and the wind made them shudder like they were still living, like the great strength of the Omnissiah had never forgotten His world. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Augusta was trying to picture the full industrial capability that this planet must once have offered – the noise, the motion, the heat, the stench, the steam and oil and fuel. The electric-lightning charges of the temples. The datastreams, alive in the air. The priests and the adepts, the helots, the bustling servitors, every­where, praying to their God and to the spirits of this vast production-world… All gone. Now there was just the cold, and the rust, and, high above, the shattered moon-fragments, reflecting the last red light of the unseen sun. ‘There,’ Istrix said, pointing with one ceramite arm. ‘That is our objective.’ Ahead of them: the largest open space that Augusta had yet seen. It appeared to be some huge hauler station – long lines of parallel rails stretched away from it, glinting in the debris-light, and there was a turntable at the centre, rusted into place. And, across on the far side, there rose the metal walls and blackly silhouetted chimneys of a crumbling factorum. She heard the corporal let out his breath; he must know, as she did, that if Zale had come here to muster an ambush force, it could be considerable… And there was still a seething, leering crowd of locals at their backs. Even now, the ork’s big boots were thumping up the final set of stairs. If that beast and its minions made it out onto the platform, there would be absolutely no cover. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said softly. ‘Estimation of numbers, ahead and behind.’ ‘Ahead, almost nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Five contacts, all located within the factorum itself. Behind us, maybe thirty, forty.’ The Sister paused, as if thinking, then said, ‘Sister Superior, there is a very good chance that the force within the factorum may not yet be in motion–’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta agreed. ‘I hear you.’ They were rapidly reaching the crisis point, the event horizon. Everything in Augusta’s military training told her to take the tactical decision and to remove the known threat, the one at their backs… …but to disobey the inquisitor was heresy. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris! The ork reached the top of the steps. It wore a skull-and-bones hat and a long coat with gold frogging down the front. Seeing them, it grinned, its fangs broken and yellow – fully smart enough to realise its own advantage. Her voice tense, her tone dangerous, Augusta said, ‘Inquisitor…’ The word came out sharper than she’d intended. Istrix almost snarled, ‘We will not demean ourselves, fighting this rabble. Now, move!’ They broke into a run. Behind them, the ork roared and stamped; the whole platform shook. Leaving the thing made Augusta’s blood rage even higher – she’d never fled an enemy in her entire life. And an ork! It went against everything she believed, everything she’d learned, against thirty years of her novitiate training and battle-experience– In her heart, her prayer rose higher – she needed His guidance, His forgiveness. She needed to turn and shoot that cursed beast before it reached them. She recalled her own darkness and doubts, recalled the stern severity of His statue upon the Kyrus… He does not forgive. The ork bellowed again – outrage or laughter, she couldn’t tell, and she almost stopped. This was madness – the inquisitor was surely demented; she would kill them all. Yet they would die in His service, and was it not their greatest honour to do so? The ork stopped. At the sudden cessation of its banging feet, Augusta glanced back. It was holding up one huge mitt, pausing its accompanying rabble. As the Sisters reached the double doors of the factorum, it raised its weapon… …a flash-memory, the rocket that hit the front of the cathedral, Augusta pushing Tanichus to the floor… Caia was at the doors; she was shouting, shoving them open. Augusta did not pause to think; she was through the doorway, almost pushing Akemi and the four soldiers in front of her, turning to make sure that Viola was safe… The ork pulled the trigger. Viola flung herself through the doors. And Augusta slammed them, hard, right in the missile’s painted face. The doors were heavy, good steel. The rocket smashed into them, detonating. The heat and impact were enough to send Augusta over, a heavy clang of metal on top of her. Something cracked; sickening pain shot though her shoulder. Throne! It felt broken; she needed Melia to look at it… It would have to wait. Shoving the fallen doors sideways with her good hand, she got back to her feet. They were in. They lived, they survived. Despite the pain, she offered a breath of prayer, a thanks for their lives, but that was all she had the time for. Because, in the hard, white light of the factorum, something was waiting for them. ‘And here you all are,’ said a voice. ‘You’ve caused quite the sensation.’ It was deep and rich and warm. It spoke of welcome, of forgiveness, of wealth and luxury, and it came from the factorum floor. From their vantage on the high, metal balcony, Augusta could see… Down there, in among the long, hulking corpses of the production machines, a single, strong-shouldered figure. He had a rogue trader look about him, long boots and decorous jacket, its fringed epaulettes glinting. And though he was both unarmed and unarmoured, she registered his physical beauty as if it were a bolter, strapped to his hip. It was a weapon, and one he knew how to use. Her mind said the words: Thou shalt not suffer… But, flicking on her preysight, she was also looking for something else – Caia had said five contacts. There should be others here: Sister Melia, two thugs, and the last one must surely be Rayos. She could not see them, though there were many pitch-black shadows at the outer limits of the room – corners concealed by great, empty hoppers or by the collapsed sections of wall. Her roll call in the vox did not secure a response. Scafidis Zale, however, had given the Sisters only a cursory glance. Istrix had stalked to the balcony’s edge, Caia still with her. The tall Sister towered over the inquisitor, yet Istrix’s passion gave her an intensity of focus that was almost tangible. She radiated… What? Rage? Zeal? ‘Interesting bodyguards, Issy,’ Zale said, his tone amused. ‘These ones have even survived. Smart game move, to secure the service of the Adepta Sororitas.’ He smiled, the expression wicked. ‘I confess – I hadn’t anticipated that one. You must have thought you’d beaten me.’ Augusta felt herself react to the compliment, strangled the feeling like some irksome gretchin. Don’t you play me, witch… In the vox, Viola said, ‘Sisters, we’ve got another problem.’ The Sister Superior glanced back. The bulging frame of the ork had appeared at the shattered doorway, though it had stopped, its weapon still in hand. A throng of smaller figures had clustered up to it, but none of them seemed to want to come closer. ‘Oh, don’t worry about them,’ Zale said, with an offhand wave. ‘They’re all part of the game. They were just making sure you got here safely.’ The words were out before Augusta could stop them: ‘You’re controlling them.’ Istrix rounded on her. ‘Be silent, Sister.’ The inquisitor’s response was immediate, her usually cold tones thrumming with something deeper. It felt like eagerness, like some sense of need. ‘Do not interfere.’ Interfere? The witch must die! Her fury rising like bile, Augusta closed her teeth on the retort. Her hand was on her bolter, craving to pull it free, to loose her rage at last. But Zale laughed aloud, the noise ringing in the emptiness like some perfect, chapel bell. ‘Still determined to end this yourself, my mistress. I should be flattered.’ Istrix cursed him, leaning further over the balcony as if she would spit fire. ‘You! Witch! Traitor! You could have served the Emperor in the greatest of capacities, you could have seen the streams of the empyrean, been one with the vastness of space! You could have had ships at your call, raised your voice and mind to the stars! You could have had every­thing! We could have had…’ ‘We.’ Zale cut her dead, his tone icing over. ‘You, Istrix. You. You, and your ambition, and your selfishness, and your greed. When my talents manifested, you didn’t want me to serve the Emperor. You wanted to present me to Him, gain favour and status. It was never about my future. It was always about you.’ ‘Liar!’ Istrix was raging, leaning over the balcony. ‘I cared for you, trained you! I would have given you everything–’ ‘Warpshit!’ Zale was losing his elegant calm; his rage, too, was rising. ‘You offered me nothing! Slavery! What choice did I have? To be captive, to be Penitent, or to be fodder? Fed to the Emperor to keep His soul alight? You gave me my ambition, Istrix – you taught it to me! And you know me better than to think I would ever surrender.’ His anger peaked, and subsided; he mustered a laugh. ‘And when I surpass you on every level.’ ‘How dare you!’ Istrix was thundering vehemence. ‘You accursed, filthy heretic!’ ‘Ah, Issy. You’ve followed me all the way here. And now you’ve lost, and you don’t even know it.’ Below them, somewhere in the black and hard-edged shadows, machines were grinding into motion. Augusta raised a prayer and it echoed from the metal roof like the call of a vox-coder trumpet. She thought she saw the flickering of an oil-black cloak, thought she heard the almost soundless tick-ticking of Rayos’ data-prayer. And then, in the outermost shadows of the factorum, joints and servos were moving, whining and scraping as they struggled through long years of rust. Akemi said, with a sudden of rush of intensity, ‘Kastelans.’ A second later, Caia added, ‘Two, nothing else is in motion.’ ‘Two is enough,’ Augusta commented, her tone flat. ‘You will not fire, Sisters,’ Istrix said. ‘This is pure intimidation, nothing more.’ ‘Intimidation!’ Viola snorted the word, cocking the heavy bolter. ‘We’re surrounded!’ Somewhere behind them, the big ork loosed a belch. Caught in a split-second of pure stillness, in the centre of the tornado of questions, between enemies before and behind, Augusta offered a final questioning prayer. Guide me! Is this woman Your vessel? It is Your work that she does? Or is she tainted? Touched by Ruin? Her darkness loomed at her, Subul’s mockery, her own doubts. And then she remembered, again, the Kyrus’ chapel… I am His daughter, my faith and weapons unquestioned, unquestionable; war is my craft and my study. I am strong. I am enough. And, as the kastelans ground slowly up to full speed, as Zale raised his hands, laughing at the success of his crafted drama, as the ork scratched its belly and kicked its way over the fallen doors, Augusta did the unthinkable. She offered her prayer. She made her choice. And she defied her orders. ‘Viola – fire!’ The thrice-blessed heavy bolter snarled into life with a sound like pure relief. Even as Istrix howled over the vox, the ork went backwards in a spray of gore, its hat flying free. The fallen doors clattered as it fell down on top of them. Viola shouted the words of the litany, less a hymn than a celebration of pure, focused violence – it had been building in the younger Sister ever since they’d landed on this cesspit of a planet. And Augusta could feel the same thing, that rising need to let it go. But not yet. ‘Cease fire!’ Istrix had turned on the Sisters, livid with incomprehension. ‘I gave you an order! Cease fire!’ Something in the Sister Superior wondered why the inquisitor was still so maniacally intent upon stopping them shooting – but there was no time for that now. She had defied her superior. What happened next – victory or Repentance – was the will of the Emperor. Bolter in her good hand, her shoulder still spiking with pain, Augusta continued to bark commands. ‘Caia, Akemi, take down the kastelans. Corporal, target the heretek – stop her activating anything else. And don’t let her out of your sight!’ She added her voice to Viola’s, felt the hearts of her squad rise – no more indecision, no more questions. Just the pure, clean rage of battle. From the fury… This was what she had been called for! Istrix was shrieking, spitting outraged fragments of words. She was hammering the heel of her free hand against the side of her skull – with a sudden, intuitive flash, Augusta understood something else, though she didn’t have time to realise it clearly. The roar of combat was already raging round her. With the big ork down, nothing else was tough enough to get past the bottleneck of the doorway. Yet they still came, shoving towards their own deaths as if they could not help it. Viola kept firing, and kept firing, short staccato bursts. She must know the truth as well as Augusta did – when she ran out of ammunition, they would be on her. And she had no Sister to cover her back. At the balcony’s edge, Caia and Akemi were shooting at the lumbering, grinding kastelans. The things were still slow, and they had no ranged weapons – thank the Emperor! – but they had fists the size of tanks and one thump would be enough to crush a slow-moving Sister to the floor. Beside the Sisters, the Militarum soldiers had switched targets. Under the corporal’s commands, they were firing at the kastelans’ joints and visors, though they were making little impact. Augusta could not see Rayos – the shadowy tech-priest had vanished. And she still could not see Melia. The Sister Superior aimed her bolter at the closest of the machines; saw its visor crack under the impact. She shot it again, and again. It jolted under the repeated rounds, but both machines were still moving, and faster with every step. They stood fourteen feet at their armoured shoulders and, if they reached the wall, Augusta realised, they could just pull the whole balcony clean onto the floor… Shards of pain still stabbed through her shoulder; she kept her injured arm to her chest and switched to shooting at the kastelans’ knee and elbow joints. Beside her, the corporal directed his squad to shoot at their fingers. He must have reached the same conclusion. Behind them, the heavy bolter clattered to a halt. Viola raised the hymnal with a rush of defiance – she was trying to reload, but the city’s thugs had been smart enough to use the bodies as cover. Now they were up and through the doorway; they were piling past the fallen ork, knowing that they had to stop her before she raised the weapon again. Augusta spun and bellowed, ‘Down!’ Viola dropped to a kneel, still reloading the bolter. The Sister Superior turned her fire on the crowd. She levelled short, controlled bursts as more and more of them tried to shove through the doorway. She couldn’t stop them all – the doorway was too wide and the piles of bodies too high. And Viola was just too close. The crowd closed around the red-armoured Sister, and she fought them back with her fists and feet, and the butt of her weapon. The Sister Superior stopped; she couldn’t shoot without the risk of hitting Viola. But they had another problem. The first of the kastelans had reached the balcony. Its joints still grinding in protest, it gripped the edge and started to pull. Creaking and groaning, the ancient metalwork began to split, and to come away from the wall. In her head, the Sister Superior could hear laughter, ringing and joyous – it tangled round her recitation of the hymnal. She sang louder, defiant, shutting it out. The second kastelan reached the balcony’s edge, took hold. With a protesting, metallic screech, the entire platform started to come loose. Unaware of her danger, Viola was moving like a dancer, fluid despite her armour, punching and kicking with a relentlessness that was pure, loosed savagery. Augusta had another flicker of memory: Jatoya’s physical strength, and the training she had given to all of them. She offered a fragment of thanks in a prayer. Akemi and Caia were still shooting at the kastelans. They could hardly miss; the machines were right on top of them, their blank armour-eyes staring out of their helmets like dead things. The Sisters were doing damage – sparks flew as rounds hit, the Militarum troopers were still firing – but it was not enough, never enough. The platform shrieked and screamed and juddered. Augusta felt it lurch as it came away from the wall. And then crashed to the floor with a noise like the end of the world, dumping all of them at the crisply booted feet of Scafidis Zale.",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE In thick, slow motion, Sister Melia watched everything. She was concealed beneath the shadow of a vast and silent hopper – she couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. She was not restrained, but a heavy fog of lassitude had soaked into her limbs and her thoughts. It had robbed her of any energy, and left her listless and dull. And there was something she’d forgotten, something… Something like a light, maybe, but just beyond her field of vision. She watched the balcony as it fell, watched the creaking, groaning metal as it collapsed to the floor. She saw the four scarlet-armoured figures as they fell with it. One rolled straight back to its feet, two others got up more slowly. The last one landed with a huge, metal door smashing down on top of it, edge-first. It did not move again. A flicker of concern went through Melia’s soul, but it soon faded, lost to the grey. Her distress was too nebulous, like trying to grip smoke – she understood that the red figures were important, but she couldn’t remember why. Domine, libra nos…? The words lingered, like some echo of her past. To either side of her, the two gangers were grinning, watching the fight like it was some sort of gang battle. Whenever Zale spoke, they snickered obediently; he’d had no need to give them orders. As the kastelans moved towards the tumble of fallen figures, each ganger smacked his fist into his opposite palm, eager for more violence. They moved like servitors, mindless – but she could no more have drawn her flamer on them than she could have reached for her hidden fleur-de-lys blade… Her gauntleted hand twitched in her lap, as if it were missing something. Yet there was only the fog, only the grey. She was safe in the grey, it was like a blanket. Like strong, stone walls, the big machines couldn’t touch her, wouldn’t notice her. Here, she could rest. Yet still, Sister Melia was sure that she’d forgotten something… On the factorum floor, Augusta rolled back to her feet, bolter still in hand. The nasty stab of pain in her shoulder kept her head clear and sharp; she took in the scenario with a glance. Akemi and Caia were both getting up, but the falling doors had smashed Viola to the ground, and she wasn’t moving. A roll call in the vox did not get a response from the younger Sister. Around Viola’s still form were the city’s tumbled thugs. Some were getting up, dazed, others groaned in pain or did not move at all. Several more were still in the doorway, hiding in cover, their weapons aimed at the scene below. They did not fire. Corporal Mors was upright, Rufus with him; their lasrifles were aimed at the thugs, making them keep their heads down. Adriene was moving, but more slowly; Lucio stared sightless at the roof, his helmet tumbled off and his young face etched with a final expression of shock. By the angle, his neck was broken. The Sister Superior had a split-second to take all this in – then her line of light was blocked by something small, armoured, and lividly angry. Istrix stood in front of her, her face etched in bright scarlet and white, cross-hatched scars. A nimbus of hair had stood up from its braid – it had given her a halo, gleaming shock-white in the lumens. ‘I told you, I told you!’ Istrix’s words were a spittle-filled snarl. ‘I told you not to fire!’ Augusta inhaled, closing her teeth on a flare of livid and absolute fury. She recited her Oath of Ordination, striving for calm. Fides est armis meus mihi telum erudiens. My faith is my armour, my training my weapon. Smirking as if at some glorious, private joke, Zale lifted a hand to halt his various minions. The looming kastelans ground to a halt. Between them, the witch stood back with his arms folded, his attitude curious, and his confidence tangible – whoever won, this was still his game, and he was still in control. But the Sister Superior spared all of this barely a glance. There was a bolter-muzzle right in her face, a small, round void of death. Istrix’s words were vicious. ‘You are a traitor, Sister, just as much as he is. You have undermined my authority at every turn. You have refused my orders, taken initiatives to which you were not entitled. I am His word, His blade, and His law.’ She thundered the last sentence. ‘And I expect to be obeyed!’ Around them, the tableau had halted. Caia and Akemi flanked Augusta, weapons out, one to either shoulder; Viola, still, had not moved. Mors and Rufus were each dropped to one knee, covering the thugs, the kastelans and Zale himself. Adriene had joined them, though there was a trickle of scarlet down one side of her face. Nothing moved, nothing seemed to breathe. Everything held still, mesmerised by the confrontation between the tiny, furious inquisitor and the calm, steel-cold solidity of the veteran Sister. Augusta said, her tone pure steel, ‘I follow my mandate, guided by His wisdom.’ She pointed her bolter at Zale. ‘This witch must die.’ But Istrix was beyond hearing, beyond understanding. ‘Do you doubt my authority, Sister? My orders? Do you doubt His power? It is His voice I hear, His instructions I follow! He has brought us here! And He will tell me when to open fire!’ She trembled with intensity. ‘Heretics and betrayers, all of you! You are the denizens of Ruin! There is no faith! No loyalty! No trust! You are all fallen! All damned! I will kill you all! I will bring this whole planet to destruction with you still on it! You will blow to pieces like the moons–!’ ‘Then why don’t you?’ Zale spread his arms. His voice soft, he said, ‘Come on, my lovely. My Issy. My mistress. Do as He bids you. After all,’ and his smile was glorious, ‘you always have.’ Her eyes wild, Istrix was gripping the bolter in both hands now, her shaking increasing. There was a nerve-spasm ticking under her eye; her teeth were gritted. She looked like she was fighting something. Augusta said, ‘Shoot him, inquisitor. Or I will.’ The corporal’s voice interjected: ‘She won’t shoot him, Sister. She can’t.’ Augusta said, ‘What?’ ‘It’s the thing I couldn’t tell you,’ he said. He wasn’t looking at her; he still had his lasrifle trained on the thugs. ‘Why she shot the lieutenant.’ Realisation broke over Augusta like an ice-cold tide. In that second, even as the corporal spoke, the final question was answered, and she understood the thing she’d missed, right from the beginning… ‘He put it together,’ Mors said, ‘when he saw her cutting the scars into her own face. Zale’s been in her head all along – playing with her, torturing and tormenting her. She thinks she’s hearing the Emperor, doing His bidding. The lieutenant confronted her. And she shot him. Commanded the rest of us to say nothing, on our oath to Him.’ Oh, of course… It explained why Istrix had walked them straight into the initial ambush, why she’d specifically sought out Rayos, why she had persistently refused to let them open fire… Explained what – and why – the Militarum soldiers could not tell them. Zale had been playing with them all, all along – he’d probably let Mors see him at the smeltorium. So that he could lead them all here. Just like he’d lured Mors’ squad into a confrontation, and then murdered them… Just like the signal from the broken moons… Wrecker. Playing them, reeling them in. Too late, Augusta realised the wisdom of her own teachings: Everything has its Operandus. Zale had played his game expertly… And, if the Sisters were not strong enough to withstand him, he might even have won. The Sister Superior found that she, too, was shaking. Not from fear, but from the sheer brutality of the realisation, and from the rise of anger it brought with it… They had failed. Istrix had been weak, and she had faltered in her faith… And Augusta had not challenged her, despite knowing full well that she should have done. Perhaps the Penitence should be hers… But not until the witch was dead. ‘You betrayed us.’ Ice-calm, Augusta spoke to Istrix. ‘Led us into a trap. You have surrendered your soul, Istrix, your faith and your honour.’ Her squad continued to cover the witch; she turned her own bolter on the inquisitor. ‘You are a tool of Ruin, nothing more. You have turned your back upon Him, and opened your soul to the darkness.’ Istrix had bitten her lip. She was spitting blood and froth and outrage. ‘I have not failed! I will slay you all! You will feel His wrath! His strength! His light!’ ‘She’s mad,’ said Akemi softly, her tone awed. Augusta stepped forwards, placed her bolter beneath the woman’s chin, forcing her head back. ‘You are fallen, Istrix. Your life is forfeit. You–’ A weapon barked. The inquisitor collapsed. Augusta rocked on her heels, startled, but the shot had not been hers. It had not even been a bolter – it had been a single streak of heat, a sizzling hole bored clean through the side of the woman’s skull. Istrix lay on the floor, her mouth open, her scars pale. Smoke rose from her eye sockets. Blood pooled round her head like a corona. Carefully, the corporal raised his hands, but he did not release his rifle. Rufus and Adriene glanced at each other, then at the Sister Superior. They, too, raised their arms. But the group had a more immediate problem. Zale was swearing, savage and vicious and livid; his kastelans were moving again. ‘No! What have you done? What have you done?!’ And Augusta’s mind exploded. As the battle began, Sister Melia watched. She watched the kastelans as they lumbered into motion once more, felt the heavy stamping of their great feet. She heard the gangers chuckling, heard the continuous, monotone tick-ticking of Rayos’ heretek prayer. She was aware of the three red-armoured figures that stood against the remains of the city horde, and against the huge might of the looming machines. She watched it all as if through a mist, through a repeated blur of words that filled her head. You are nothing. You are abandoned. His light has left you. You cannot fulfil your role. You have made too many errors, Melia… In the fog in her head, there were thin lines of light – the lasrifles of the Militarum. There were shouts and orders; they spoke to something deep in her soul, some reflexive reaction. She found her hand in her lap twitching with more insistence, looking for something – an answer that the fog did not give her. And she could still see the glow – not its source, but the illumination that came from it, like something she’d lost. Something important. More words came through the grey – words like a blessing. A spiritu dominatus… Her twitching increased, her hand seemed to move towards her hip. There was more fighting, now. The great machines were moving more swiftly, feet stamping, fists slamming and grabbing. The three remaining soldiers were keeping the rabble back – shooting at the doorway above and battering those closest with the butts of their weapons. Two of the red figures stood against the kastelans; one still lay motionless, crushed beneath the doors… The other one stood still, swaying slightly as if it had lost the will to move. Even as Melia watched, it went over with a crash, face down. It made no attempt to put out its arms or to save itself. Its black and white cloak fluttered and was still. Augusta. The name came through the fog like the strike of a tutor’s ruler – it was the first thing that had made sense. The Sister Superior had fallen.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN With no warning, the factorum was gone. Augusta was young, and wide-eyed, and in the grey robes of a novitiate. She was walking into the font-waters of her Ordination, but they were black and filthy, and the bodies of lost Sisters bobbed past her. On the far side, there waited a brand new set of armour, glistening like blood – her first. She’d trained for it, worked for it, and it was finally, really hers – yet she couldn’t reach it. The waters about her were covered in oil, and even as she struggled through their viscosity, her Sisters’ hymns about her congealed into a sour, minor key. The font burst into flame. The water burned, hot and raw, biting at her robed flesh. It was the flame of Lycheate’s pollution, of the Lautis daemon; it was the exultation of her combat-rage, and the darkness in her heart. It was glorious, and brutal. But, amidst the whirl and the heat and the pain, the Sister Superior clung on. In her head, the image from the chapel on the Kyrus – His face, stern and unforgiving. She could not perish, not like this – He would not permit her failure. Her anger – the thing with which Subul had tormented her, the thing she’d seen reflected in the daemon – that anger was her ally. And it was not darkness. It was good. Augusta’s hand was burned through to the bone, but still, she closed it on the grip of her bolter. She raised her voice, trying to sing the litany, coughing and tuneless in the midst of the smoking, suffocating heat: ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ As the Sister Superior fell, Melia’s thoughts spasmed with genuine fear. Around Augusta’s downed figure, the battle raged on. The kastelans were protecting Zale; one ground to a halt as a bolter took out its knee. It tried to take a further step and fell like a colossus, crushing friend and foe alike. One of the Militarum soldiers gave a final, awful scream. From somewhere beside her, Melia heard the strange tick-ticking intensify… Rayos. But the Sister’s head was clearing and the memories were coming back fast now, flooding the fog with new light – the shattered moons, the rust-brown planet, the crazed inquisitor. A spiritu dominatus Domine, libra nos. Only the litany… Only the lifeline… In her head, the fog was dissipating – stretching, thinning, fading. She shook herself, trying to clear her thoughts. The hand in her lap moved with more urgency. It was looking for a weapon. Jatoya’s flamer. Her flamer. Her flamer that she had earned, by virtue of her experience and wisdom; her flamer that she knew. Then she heard the ticking cease, heard Rayos say, ‘Sister Melia Kaliyan is seventy-eight point one per cent recovered. She will commence motion in two point two seconds.’ Startled, the gangers moved. But they were too late. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ From somewhere, the Sisters’ hymn was answering Augusta’s half-croaked words with the twinned sounds of prayer and gunfire. She heard the crash as the second kastelan went over, shaking the floor. And then, another voice – weak, but singing with them. Contralto. Familiar. Sister Viola, too damned stubborn to lose her life to anything as foolish as a fallen door. The surprise of it was like an influx of strength, like the music of a waterfall, putting out the flames. ‘I see you, Zale.’ She couldn’t see him – her eyes had melted in her skull. But she knew he was there, wrecker and manipulator, traitor and betrayer. Player of games. He had lured Istrix here, lured all of them here… For what? The thought was sharp, like a sudden hook of faith and clarity. Caught, her mind began to focus. All of this, was it just some impassioned connection between mistress and pupil? Or was it something more? Somewhere above her, the corporal slammed a final thug in the face with the butt of his rifle. He was shouting, and he was standing at an angle that was somehow all wrong. ‘Sister! Sister! Can you hear me? Sister!’ She was on the floor. ‘Sister!’ How…? Domine, libra nos. The flames had gone. She was herself, and unhurt – except for her broken shoulder. If Zale had been trying to control her, as he had controlled Istrix, he had failed. Her bolter was still in her grip. Slowly, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus got back to her feet. The two gangers were local toughs – heavy and filthy. They were decent enough as Lycheate enforcers, but they were no match for a fully-armoured member of the Adepta Sororitas. Melia downed one with a gauntlet to the face, brought the elbow sharply back to break the nose of the other. He stumbled, cursing and spitting, then tried for a grapple. But her other hand had drawn her flamer and she cracked him sharply on the head with the butt. He went down like a sack of rocks. ‘Ssss.’ Rayos had backed up, all her limbs mantling over her head. Her eyes – one red and one blue – were both fixed on Melia. Her mechadendrites rippled, tasting air and opportunity. There was a one hundred per cent chance that Melia was going to end her heretek existence. But there was data in the air, both prayer and plea; there were a hundred streams of information coming from somewhere beneath that oil-black cloak… What was down here? What was she trying to reach? Melia didn’t care. She pulled the trigger. Screaming in both human tongue and machine-code, the tech-priest became a torch. The city’s thugs were beaten, the kastelans ruined. Around Augusta, her Sisters were moving. Caia and Akemi were methodically executing the injured; Viola was shoving the door sideways with an angry curse – the red-haired Sister had not appreciated missing half the battle. Rufus had gone to help her. The corporal, the only other member of the squad surviving, had his lasrifle trained on the doorway above, though the last of the figures had gone. In the midst of destruction, Zale stood like an icon. He was losing his composure, now; he looked rattled and angry. Caia pulled the trigger on the final, protesting thug. It jerked, and was still. She turned to him, and said, ‘Where’s Melia?’ He replied, almost petulant, ‘You spoiled my game. All that work, everything I’ve planned and plotted – and she died!’ Suddenly, he was shouting, his fists clenched at his sides. ‘I needed her to see this! To see what I have done!’ ‘And what have you done, Zale?’ Augusta’s adrenaline was fading, now, and the pain in her shoulder was making her nauseous. ‘What is this wonder that you brought us all here to behold?’ ‘No.’ He stepped forwards, still the performer; despite his tight and twisted rage, he had an air of a man wanting to deliver a masterstroke. ‘I am still winning. I know how you think. I can tear you open, all of you. Do you know what a powerful psyker can do to a human mind? I can hollow you out like an egg. I can play upon your fears. I can conjure xenos, terrors from the warp, a hundred tortures to deliver pain to the cores of your souls. I can make you die, over and over again. I can make you fail. I can take your faith. I can give you despair, disaster and depression–’ ‘You’re as mad as your mistress,’ Augusta told him. ‘We are the servants of the God-Emperor,’ Caia said. ‘We can stand against your tricks, witch.’ ‘Can you?’ He rounded on the taller Sister. ‘I have already broken Sister Melia. She was weak, plagued by doubts. I know what you fear.’ Caia gave a single, piercing scream, a sharp, high sound that split the air like a siren. She crashed over sideways, her body wracked by spasms. Viola swore. The red-haired Sister was not yet on her feet, but she brought the heavy bolter up anyway. ‘I wouldn’t.’ Zale was trying to smile, but his expression had lost its elegance, and it was edged like a blade. ‘You want to know why I’m here?’ He laughed, brittle and crazed. ‘You think I just lured you, Sister Superior? I have Lycheate completely under my control. And I can lure all of them – every last member of the Inquisition can be called here, to their death! You think I just wanted revenge on Istrix?’ His laughter scaled upwards. ‘I will kill every one of them – every last one! – until they muster enough force to stop me.’ ‘That was what you wanted her to know,’ Augusta said. ‘That she had brought death upon her fellows. So that she would die, knowing exactly what she’d done.’ ‘She would have died in horror.’ Zale’s eyes shone like pyrite, the gold of a fool. ‘Knowing she was damned. Don’t try to stop me, Sister Augusta, or I will torture your entire squad, rip out their minds. Rayos will tear Melia to pieces.’ His grin spread. ‘And then we will rebuild her.’ ‘Try it,’ Augusta said, ‘and I will shoot every one of them myself.’ She raised her bolter. ‘Hold!’ The word came from a familiar, red-armoured figure, stepping from the shadows with her flamer in her hand. Augusta almost laughed; she raised her voice in a prayer like a celebration. But Sister Melia wasn’t finished. ‘Rayos is dead.’ Walking forwards, her helmet off, her flamer in hand, she had every bit as much presence as the witch. ‘Tear us open, will you? Hollow us out like eggs? Conjure monsters, xenos, a hundred tortures? You cannot make me die, witch, or lose my faith, or fail. And the only doubts are yours.’ ‘No!’ Zale was screaming now, rage and denial. ‘This can’t happen! You can’t–!’ There was a whoosh, and a flare. And the witch burned, just like Rayos had done. The factorum floor was covered in bodies. Sickened by the rich, thick smell of charred flesh, Augusta made sure that neither Melia nor Caia had been harmed, then she sent them to retrieve Rayos’ corpse. She wanted the heretek’s data – wanted to know what Rayos had been doing. What she’d found. What this ‘force’ really was that she had been assembling for Scafidis Zale. She put a round through the witch’s skull herself – just to make sure – and then turned to consider the fallen form of the inquisitor. Because, now that the mission was over, they had a very serious problem. ‘Corporal Mors.’ The corporal and Rufus had been paying what respects they could to their fallen comrades. At the order, Mors came to his feet and offered Augusta a salute. ‘Sister Superior.’ ‘I asked you in the lift, corporal,’ Augusta said, ‘how you came to be upon Lycheate.’ Her words were considered, thoughtful. Melia had set her shoulder and offered her a painkilling injection, and the Sister Superior had removed her helm. The young man watched her expression, his face tense. ‘But you did not have time to answer.’ It wasn’t a question, and Mors’ lifted his chin. She went on, ‘You have no insignia, corporal, none of you. No platoon, no company, no regiment. It has been scrubbed from your armour.’ ‘Sister, we–’ ‘You’re a good man, Mors.’ She turned from Istrix’s fallen form to look the young man in the face. ‘Your courage and swift thinking have been exceptional. But.’ Mors straightened his shoulders, held Augusta’s gaze. ‘You know the penalty for desertion.’ Rufus, crouched by the fallen Lucio, looked up sharply. ‘Yes, Sister. But…’ The corporal swallowed. ‘I request your permission to say one thing.’ ‘Granted.’ He looked at the body at their feet. Its eyes were glassy, and it was already starting to bloat. ‘I’m Astra Militarum, Sister – my individual life is worth nothing. And I’m a deserter, a coward and a traitor. But you… all of you… you’re Sororitas. I’ve heard stories about the Sisters of Battle – about how you halt entire wars with just your presence. About how the God-Emperor Himself gifted you the arts of combat.’ He offered a flicker of a smile. ‘About how you bite men’s heads from their shoulders–’ ‘Only when I’m really hungry,’ Augusta told him, straight-faced. The corporal blinked, almost laughed. Then he sobered, and said, ‘I pulled the trigger, Sister, so that you wouldn’t have to.’ Augusta eyed him thoughtfully. From anyone else, the words might have sounded like a lie, calculated to flatter, but she found that she believed him. ‘Sadly,’ she said, ‘I must still make answer for Istrix’s death. The responsibility is mine, whether I pulled the trigger or not.’ She watched him until he looked back up, met her gaze. ‘I believe you made the right choice, corporal. But the repercussions of this are out of my hands.’ Rufus had stood up, and had come to stand at Mors’ shoulder. Akemi said to him, ‘You still haven’t told us where you came from.’ ‘Tallus VII,’ Mors said. ‘We were left behind when our regi­ment pulled out. They didn’t come back for us, left us for the tyranids. But the Emperor blessed us – we escaped with the planet’s refugees, and that’s how we came here. I’d kind of hoped that, if we worked for Istrix, she would take us home.’ He shrugged, philosophical. ‘But now, I guess you’re going to execute us after all.’ Augusta tapped her boot. ‘I cannot take that decision,’ she said. ‘I must speak with my canoness, and upload a full and detailed report. And we must – all – face whatever comes in its wake.’ The thought was not a comfortable one. ‘Mors, is there somewhere we can secure an off-planet signal?’ Trying to hide his relief, the corporal said, ‘Back at the depot, Sister. Istrix’s shuttle is still there.’ ‘Good.’ She nodded. ‘We will return to the Kyrus, all of us, and await the canoness’ orders – and her punishment.’ The word was bitterly dark. ‘You will both be confined to quarters, and held under guard.’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Mors said. ‘Thank you.’ Augusta nodded, and turned as Caia and Melia came back to the factorum floor. They had weapons in their hands, and their expressions were concerned. ‘Tell me you found Rayos,’ Augusta said. ‘No, Sister,’ Caia told her. ‘We did not. We tracked her by the trail of blood and oil, but she must self-repair – it led only as far as the next hangar.’ Her tone was worried. ‘Sister, that hangar was full.’ ‘What?’ Melia said, ‘You know the old saying – the Mechanicus never delete anything?’ Augusta said, a statement of realisation, ‘There’s an army in there.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia said. ‘They all bear the mark of Incaladion, but they’re hundreds of years old. How the Mechanicus missed them, I cannot guess – but Rayos must have found them. Maybe the heretek Vius found them, on his original quest.’ ‘And they’re what Zale wanted,’ Augusta said. ‘An army of his own.’ Augusta shook her head, some part of her ­baffled by his and Istrix’s obsessive connection. ‘How strange, to be that consumed with another human.’ She dwelled on the oddity of it for a moment, then dismissed the whimsy. ‘We must assess this army.’ ‘We should destroy it,’ Viola muttered. ‘That is not our call to make,’ Augusta said. ‘While I have had enough of Lycheate’s filth, the presence of this force must be reported. We will speak to the canoness. This situation has become larger than we can face alone.’ ‘Sister?’ Melia asked her. ‘I suspect,’ Augusta said, ‘that the Mechanicus will request the data. They may come here themselves, and retrieve their forces.’ ‘And if they don’t?’ Akemi asked. ‘Then,’ the Sister Superior told her, ‘our situation may escalate. I suspect… if Rayos lives, our Order will call for war.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE A lone red star, cold and swollen with age. A single satellite planet, ringed by a tumble of debris. In the limitless data-vaults of the Adeptus Mechanicus, it was designated Forge World Vastum-01 – a place of industry and production, of flexsteel and ferrocrete, of the sparking towers of forge temples and the smoothly flowing code of its living machinery. Its moons were reported as abundant with mines, its surface crawling with every kind of manufactorum. But Vastum was old. Finally stripped of its resources during the advance of the Iron Duke Glevan, it had been abandoned by its tech-priests centuries before. Their final act: to detonate the planet’s moons at their cores, and to claw free the last of that ore-rich rock. Vastum was a world dying, valueless and lost. But not – as yet – quite dead. A tiny figure under the filthy ochre sky, her oil-black cloak flowing like liquid, the heretek 05-Ray knew more about Vastum’s contemporary history than did the databanks of the long-absent Mechanicus. 05-Ray had come here as a questor, two decades before, seeking the dormant secrets of the planet’s technology, and she had found many things. To 05-Ray, this was not Vastum, abandoned and bereft of worth. To 05-Ray, this was Lycheate, and a wealth of waste. She knew it intimately. As the old red sun sank slowly into brown dust, she moved swiftly, the rusting steel causeway creaking beneath her claws. Her form was wary and alert, her array of augmetic limbs deployed and ready. She was two-point-zero-four miles from the nearest manufacturing platform here, and taking care to ensure her own safety. 05-Ray may have abandoned her people and her home world of Incaladion, yet the sleeping might of this production planet still coaxed from her a silent binary prayer. Her claw caught on a weld, and she paused. Fault designation three-point-zero-six. Servitor call enabled. ETA five solar minutes and seventeen seconds. She flicked through her files, closely analysing the structure of the metalwork below. Lycheate was a water world, built over by an endless fractal of elevated steel podia, the same efficient mathematical patterns repeated over and over again. But she was far from their solidity, out here, and the waters below her were polluted with centuries of effluvium. Chemical composition – N, NO3-N, NH4-N, S2-, SO42-, PO43-, COD, dissolved solids (TDS), heavy metals. They ate at the causeway’s supports, corroding the ancient metal. If it gave way, her weak and human flesh – what there was left of it – would not survive the immersion. Bodies floated past her, their skin eaten away. The fault in the weld, however, was not serious. The servitor sent back its confirmation, and 05-Ray was freed to continue her mission. The thought sent a spark through her nerve-clusters. Knowing what awaited her, her vestigial humanity shuddered with one of the few emotions she had remaining… Hope. Or possibly: Ambition. She looked up. Ahead of her, detectable by her human eye as a dark blur against the low umber clouds, her target rose into the sky. Her other eye extended from the steel side of her skull, its telescopic lens closing focus. Heading: ninety-four degrees south-south-west. Direct distance: one-point-eight-three miles. Actual distance: one-point-eight-five miles. Chances of interception: zero-point-zero-zero-one per cent. Lycheate’s watery surface was broken by occasional scatter­ings of semi-active volcanic islands – the only landfall offered by this lost, corroding world. The largest of these now lay before her: a headless cone of black rock, basalt and granite. It seemed featureless, rising harsh from the flat metallic stillness of the sea, yet 05-Ray knew what waited within. The holiest place on this battered world. Its designation: Vastum Forge Temple-01. Now almost empty. Gone were its tech-priests and enginseers, gone its worshippers and servitors. Its smoothly glittering black steps no longer felt feet or claws; its great columns and huge portico had long since been left to crumble. And purposeless spiked its endless, glinting vox-antennae… Well, not quite. 05-Ray sent the greeting-code that announced her arrival, and flitted like a data-ghost up the black ash beach. <01-Vius.> She waited for the response to her call. The old temple hung over her, huge and hollow, its ceiling riddled with stalactites, like fangs. Fear was a lost emotion to 05-Ray – only the faint memory-ghosts of childhood terrors – but still, this place made her human skin prickle, and interrupted the smooth flow of her data retrieval. The building was broken, cracked through to its core. Its central aisle was buckled, and its interior columns stood half-tumbled, sagging against each other like tired streaks of black severity. Scattered fragments of mica and obsidian glittered scarlet with the hunger of the lava-light below. But still, there lingered a presence here. <05-Ray.> The reply did not come through her ears, nor was it her name – that was a human thing, frail and foolish. Rather, it was the string of binary that she had earned for herself, the record of her skills and discoveries. It came to her in a data-stream, a pulse like recognition. <Your mission is successful.> <Affirm.> She uploaded the images readily – the planet’s multiple factoria, their assembled machines all standing in rows. When the Litany of Activation was finally broadcast, they would flow with new life. 01-Vius accepted and assessed everything – their numbers and positions, their deployments of weaponry. He ran the full tactical analysis: in the space of milliseconds, he had extrapolated every eventuality, and secured the most functional. <Assessment complete.> His outline came back to her – their deployment, their speeds and routes. Their muster point. <Chance of success. Eighty-nine-point-eight per cent,> 01-Vius told her, as she processed the progression of information. <It is acceptable. You will proceed.> She answered him with a query. There was a piece of data that he had omitted from his calculations, but it was one that had stayed with her, like a bullet fragment lodged in her human skin. At the upload, 01-Vius paused. The stream of his code halted as he considered the shifted parameters. Greatly daring, 05-Ray sent the query again. He did not respond. Instead, in the deepest darkness of the temple, something moved. Almost in spite of herself, 05-Ray backed up a step. She miscalculated the movements of her cloak and caught a claw on its hem, as clumsy as some newly augmented novice. The air around her was quiet now, emptier of information than the dead moons themselves. A shadow-fragment detached itself from the darkness at the head of the altar steps. Her telescopic twitched, but the analysis was redundant – she knew who this was. <Master.> Like her, he wore an oil-black cloak. Like her, he still carried the cog-and-skull of Incaladion – though upon 01-Vius, that mark was embossed in the pitted flexsteel of his face. Unlike her, he had never defaced that mark. It waited like a promise. Air wheezed through the bellows in his chest, his jaw moved as he tested the cogs and cables of his vocal array. He was older than she, far older, and he reflected the rust and corrosion of Lycheate itself, almost like he had become a part of the planet’s machine-soul. 05-Ray wondered how long it had been since he had spoken aloud. He said, ‘Sororitas.’ The word had no accompanying data – it hissed through the lava-glow of the temple like a threat. ‘Correct.’ Her response, too, was aloud, though she spoke more easily. 05-Ray still had business with normal humans, and she better remembered this ungainly, ineffectual communication. They’d even had their own name for her – they’d called her ‘Rayos’. 01-Vius forced the air out of his chest. It was a moment before she understood that he was laughing. She who had no fear – it chilled her to the core. ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said, the words grinding like rust. ‘And in numbers.’ She knew that he was calculating those numbers, running battle plans and assessing consequences, but he did not offer her the new data. She waited. Slowly, 01-Vius creaked down the stairs, his great shoulders hunched, his joints grinding. Beneath his cloak, his metal chest was scarred with rust and old wounds, and his multiple limbs were held folded, almost as if, like his voice, he no longer had need of them. He came to stand before her, towering over her smaller form. The temple’s close heat radiated from his body. Upon 01-Vius, there was no flesh remaining. The word was out before she could stop it, ‘Master?’ ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said again. Holo-images flickered in the lava-light – red armour and righteous wrath, the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. 05-Ray said, ‘Affirm.’ Again, that amused exhalation. Yet there was still no upload, and the info-vacuum was loud as a shout. ‘Let them,’ 01-Vius said. ‘My force is assembled. My data is correct. My extrapolations are without error. If they come, then they will die.’ The huge sun sank, its sullen light fading to a low glare. An old doorway ground open against a layer of metallic dust. An expanding arc of illumination swelled across a silent floor. Within it, a red boot came down, ceramite ringing on stone. It was followed by a second, both caked with the filth of Lycheate’s rusting evening; a black-and-white cloak fluttered above them, its hem newly repaired. Sister Superior Augusta Santorus closed the heavy door behind her and stood silent, looking up a long, central aisle towards a set of unfamiliar steps. A twenty-year veteran of the Adepta Sororitas, Augusta had spent her life in the chapels and cathedrals of the God-Emperor of Mankind, her head bared in humility, her weapons laid aside. Yet this place felt… Strange. Ahead of her, the aisle was lit by huge metal bowls, electro-furnaces, a series of them marching up either side of a black stone path. They warmed the air, and they lit the walls and pipes to a brassy, hellish glare. At the aisle’s far end, the steps led up, not to a chancel or altar, but to an intricate seethe of forgeworks, their twists and angles now glinting with the life of the flames. At their centre, their holy symbol was still visible: a half-human, half-augmented skull, surrounded by its square-toothed cog. The symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and of the Omnissiah. Behind it, where the great glassaic window should have been, there hung a long banner, black and red and white – the mark of Augusta’s Order, the Bloody Rose. It had been raised by their canoness, Elvorix Ianthe, with a powerful service of hymns and prayers, and it had appropriated this ancient building to a whole new purpose… This was no longer a forge temple. This was a muster point. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. The Litany for Divine Guidance in her heart, Augusta reflexively looked for the servitor – for its borne trays upon which to lay her weapons – but there would be no such demand, not here. Her bolter and chainsword still at her hips, she walked up the aisle. ‘Sister Superior.’ She had taken barely six steps before there was a figure at her side, a young woman in scarlet armour that still squeaked with newness. Her helm was off, revealing a smoothly tanned face of barely twenty years, its fleur-de-lys tattoo still sharp. ‘I’m Kirah, Sister,’ she said. ‘The canoness is expecting you. Please, follow me.’ Augusta did as she was asked, following the younger Sister as she ducked between the furnaces, and out towards a narrow split in the pipes. There were no novices to attend the canoness’ orders, and Kirah must be running her messages… And her summons. Not showing her tension, the Sister Superior continued to pray. Levis est mihi… Show me to the light. She had been waiting almost two weeks for this audience, cooling her heels in her squad’s temporary dormitorium – and she knew full well that the wait had been deliberate. That the canoness was making her think about the consequences of her previous mission. And Augusta understood its severity. There was every possibility that she would be stripped of her rank, her merits, her armour, and that she would find herself with the slavering fervour and eviscerator blade of the Sisters Repentia… The thought sent a shudder up her spine. But it was no more than she deserved. As they approached the split, Sister Kirah glanced back over her shoulder. ‘Just a reminder, Sister, that we’re unable to use the vox until the full security procedure is completed. This is a heretek planet, its spirits unknown to us, and we cannot be sure that our information is… untainted. For now, please only use the vox in an emergency, and use only channel epsilon.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. She wondered if the words were a warning – telling her not to speak to her squad until she had been given permission. The implied lack of trust made her shiver of tension worse, but she kept her chin lifted and her shoulders square. Whatever the canoness’ judgement, she would face it like a warrior. ‘In here, Sister.’ The young woman stopped at the gap, and gestured for the Sister Superior to move ahead. Steadying herself to stern discipline, Augusta stepped through the doorway. And stopped. The gap opened onto a small balcony, and a set of narrow steel steps leading around and down into a perfectly circular pit. The walls were one huge data-loom, a great ring of banks and wires and platforms, all now sleeping and covered with dust – but they were not what caught the Sister Superior’s attention. In the middle of the floor, there was a hololith projector, currently showing the planet itself, turning slow and semi-transparent in the centre of the room. It was surrounded by red-armoured figures, every one of them bareheaded and heavily armed – Augusta knew many of them from the Convent Sanctorum, or from previous missions. The taciturn, dark-skinned Seraphim commander, Sister Nikaya. Eleni and Roku, Sisters Superior, both veterans like herself. The single unarmoured figure, grey-haired and stoop-shouldered – Rhene, the ageing Hospitaller. There were other figures that she did not know, but there was a glint of adamantine to every chaplet, a zealous flare to every gaze. To the last woman, every one of them had stopped and looked up. The holo-planet winked out; the silence was heavy as judgement. Augusta paused, still praying. For truth, for strength. For justice, in whatever manner He may decree. Then she followed the metal stairway, around and down, and into the room. In the silence, her bootsteps clanged like bells. ‘Dismissed,’ came the canoness’ voice, clipped and commanding. ‘All except you two.’ She pointed at two of the unfamiliar figures, who stopped where they were. ‘The rest of you, the briefing will continue after Terce.’ ‘Milady.’ Retrieving electro-quills and dataslates, the Order’s senior Sisters retreated from the room. Once they had gone, the tall, ice-haired figure of the canoness emerged from behind the hololith table and stood waiting, her arms folded, her feet apart, her red armour looking almost bloodstained in the light. Her lined face was aged, but it showed no compromise; her tattoo, though blurred to blue, rested upon an expression of cold calm. Elvorix Ianthe was a stern disciplinarian, and a warrior without peer. Augusta felt her heart contract, already knowing the fate that awaited her. Before the Emperor I have sinned. Beyond forgiveness. Beyond forbearance. Beyond mercy… But she reached the bottom of the steps, and saluted. ‘Your eminence.’ ‘Sister Superior,’ Ianthe said, her tone acid. ‘Once again, you complete your mission, and you leave me with a headache.’ The word was a ruler-slap, a strike like pure discipline. Augusta caught her breath, but said nothing. She stared straight ahead, her eyes fixed on the data-loom of the far wall. ‘Your orders were very simple, Sister – to locate and slay the witch, and to obey the mission’s commander.’ Ianthe’s voice was biting, absolutely merciless. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. ‘And the mission’s commander. Was shot dead. While under your protection.’ Each phrase was clearly enunciated, hitting like a fist. ‘Yes, milady.’ Her pulse pounding, the Sister Superior did not flinch. She did not dare. ‘That fact alone would necessitate a significant reprimand.’ Ianthe paused, studying Augusta’s stone-steady expression. ‘But the commander of your mission was a member of the Emperor’s Inquisition.’ Like an irate parade-ground sergeant, she leaned in close to deliver the final word. Her chin up, her blood thundering, Augusta continued to stare straight ahead. A hundred explanations crowded to the front of her thoughts, but she would not speak until permitted. And the canoness already knew the full story – Augusta’s report had been both detailed and thorough. Stepping back, Ianthe let out her breath, apparently considering her next words. ‘Sister Superior. You have given your sworn oath, by the blade of Saint Mina and by the God-Emperor Himself, that Inquisitor Istrix had fallen to the Ruinous Powers. Do you stand by this oath?’ ‘As He is my witness, I stand by my oath.’ Augusta’s voice was flat, her words certain. ‘The witch, Scafidis Zale, had been the inquisitor’s interrogator and he had… charmed… his way into her thoughts. While she did not know it, Istrix had herself fallen to heresy. Corporal Mors shot her to save my life.’ ‘From your report, Sister,’ the canoness said, ‘he shot her to save your reputation.’ ‘That is also true,’ she said. ‘As Astra Militarum, he considered himself expendable.’ She recalled Mors’ words – But you… you’re Sororitas – and continued, ‘Corporal Mors is a good man, milady, honourable and courageous. Truly, he serves the Emperor.’ ‘Mors,’ the omission of the ex-soldier’s rank was both pointed and deliberate, ‘is a deserter. His life is forfeit. Why did you not just shoot him?’ The words were like a rope, lowering about her throat. Carefully, she answered, ‘He was under Istrix’s command, milady–’ ‘He was under Istrix’s command.’ The canoness repeated her words; let them hang in the air like the raised whip of the Repentia mistress. Still, Augusta did not flinch. Ianthe watched her, then, slowly, nodded at her discipline. ‘And that single fact, Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has secured your rank, your armour, your merits, and your continued service to this Order.’ Service…! At the word, the Sister Superior’s belly turned over, her knees went to water. She, who had faced twenty years of combat, faced witch and xenos and heretic, faced a greater daemon on her own two feet… she found herself shaking with the shock of her reprieve. Our Emperor, deliver us! She wanted to sing her thanks aloud, but she held herself still. ‘I will make sure,’ and the canoness’ smile was grim, ‘to pass your gratitude to the prioress.’ The word was a warning – perhaps indicating just how close Augusta had really come to that eviscerator blade. Sternly controlling her tone, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Which,’ the canoness went on, ‘brings me, rather neatly, to her orders.’ The Sister Superior blinked. ‘Milady?’ ‘Your squad is under-strength, Sister,’ Ianthe said. She indicated the two women who had remained in the room, one tall, slim and golden-haired, the other heavily built and square-jawed. ‘This is Sister Rhea, and Sister Alcina. They will be joining you for the remainder of this mission. Due to her seniority and length of service, Sister Alcina,’ – the square-jawed woman gave Augusta a curt nod – ‘will be replacing Sister Melia as your second-in-command.’ ‘Permission to–’ ‘Denied.’ The canoness cut across her question. ‘Since my adjutant remained upon Ophelia VII, Sister Caia de Musa will be serving me in that role. Both these Sisters will be joining your squad.’ The grim smile faded. ‘And I strongly suggest that you don’t make any further mistakes.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO In the Solidarities of Saint Mina, it is written that the God-Emperor sees all. That He walks with every Sister as she carries His name into the void, that He hears the words of every hymn, the thunder of every weapon, the battle cry of every warrior. It is also written that wherever forces are gathered in His name, there He shall be. ‘Ubi autem ambulat, ibi non potest esse deficiendi.’ Wherever He walks, there can be no failure. After the canoness’ briefing, Sister Augusta returned to her squad in their makeshift dormitorium – an abandoned hopper-trench now warmed by the richly decorated rose banners of their Order. Pipes and conduits wove their way down a long, half-cylindrical ceiling and, at the far end, an altar now stood to His might and presence. Standing before it, the Sisters recited, softly and together: ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none, We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to a close, the newly reformed squad stood in silence, heads bowed and armour gleaming. Electro-candles glinted from their scarlet armour and from the weave of wires through the walls. Augusta looked at each of them. Like her, her Sisters had been kept waiting while the canoness had decided their fate, and now she could feel their nervousness, like a tightly pulled wire. She looked down their line, from face to face. Sister Melia Kaliyan, dusky and dark-eyed and, until the canoness’ recent orders, the squad’s second-in-command. The implication of her replacement was all too clear – the witch, Scafidis Zale, had touched Melia’s mind and her trustworthiness could be compromised. Augusta trusted her Sisters completely, but the insinuation was making her flesh creep – like the nightmares left by the daemon, the witch’s mental trickery was too recent, and they needed to be wary of its residue. Next to Melia, Sister Viola Taenaris, red-haired and freckle-skinned. In her gauntleted hands she bore the exquisitely decorated, thrice-blessed heavy bolter that, here, she carried at all times. Viola was still young, and she could be both undisciplined and unpredictable, but her courage was truly ferocious. By Viola, Sister Akemi Hirari, with her black hair and pale skin and her dataslate already in her hand. Though the youngest of the squad, Akemi’s insight and education were unparalleled, and often she understood things that the others did not. Beyond them, at the far end of the line, stood the newcomer Sister Rhea, tall and elegant, her blue eyes downcast. Rhea was young enough for her tattoo to be crisp, but experienced enough to already carry three merit beads on her chaplet. She bore her auspex close to hand, as Sister Caia had always done. And behind them all stood the big, heavy-shouldered form of Sister Alcina, her arms crossed and her chaplet heavy with adamantine. She, too, was scanning the squad. Her gaze crossed Augusta’s, and stopped. Alcina, Augusta realised with a cold shock, was not just watching Melia. But the Sister Superior did not permit herself a reaction, and she opened their briefing as usual. ‘My Sisters,’ she said. ‘In the name of Holy Terra and the God-Emperor of Mankind, I entreat your attention and your vigilance.’ ‘Our vigilance is constant.’ The squad’s answers were clear and strong – they had done this many times. ‘We stand against the heretic, the xenos and the traitor. We carry His word and His light to every corner of the Imperium, and beyond. Cave ne saltem arce hostes. Let our foes beware.’ ‘Let our foes beware,’ the Sister Superior returned the salutation, and said, ‘We have been issued our orders, Sisters. As of this moment, we are in a full-combat situation.’ Carefully, she outlined the details. ‘We will observe vox silence until the command is given otherwise. We will bear full armour and weapons at all times. We will sleep in shifts, until the order is given to mobilise.’ She nodded at the pallets down one side of the trench. ‘All combat directives will come directly from the canoness to her Sisters Superior, from whom they will be relayed.’ She paused, feeling the strength of the moment – an uplift of hope and favour. ‘Truly, the Emperor has blessed us. It has been many years since our Order stood at muster. We will carry His name, His rage, and His glory out to the coming battle.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ Alcina voiced the salute, her tone severe. ‘Ave Imperator.’ The others echoed her, but Augusta could hear their tension – they were waiting for the canoness’ verdict. For the news of their fate. Akemi was frowning, and her lips moved in silent prayer. ‘Sisters,’ Augusta said. ‘Before I begin the briefing proper, I bring word of the Order’s decision.’ Melia looked up sharply. Akemi bit her lip. ‘We must offer our thanks for His justice and mercy,’ Augusta told them. ‘We will be keeping our–’ ‘We’re not going to be…?’ Viola left the word ‘Repentia’ unsaid, as if it were too terrible to voice. Sister Alcina shifted, letting her armour scrape. She gave the back of Viola’s head a glare, then raised an eyebrow at Augusta. ‘You permit your squad to interrupt you?’ Her tone was harsh, and Augusta tensed. She continued to speak, her voice carefully neutral. ‘Due to her seniority, Sister Alcina will be taking the position of my second-in-command.’ She glanced at Melia, saw the dark flash that passed across her gaze, though she said nothing. ‘Sister Rhea will be acting as lookout, as Sister Caia is attending the canoness. And in answer to your query,’ Augusta addressed her new second, her tone firm, ‘my squad have waited two solar weeks for the canoness’ verdict, and the courage they have shown has been admirable.’ She flicked a warning glance at Viola. ‘You are correct, however – I do not tolerate an interruption at a briefing.’ Viola twitched and lowered her gaze, and Augusta went on. ‘Under normal circumstances, I would likewise not field new Sisters in this squad until we had trained together. Here, however, such indulgence is not practical. I expect you to follow my orders, Sisters.’ Sister Alcina paused as if weighing what Augusta had said, and then responded, her tone measured, ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior.’ ‘Ave Imperator,’ Augusta returned. ‘I trust that this squad, with its new members, will carry the name of Saint Mina and the Emperor’s light as it has always done, and that we will discover our discipline and unity in the face of the enemy.’ Sister Rhea repeated, ‘Ave Imperator.’ ‘Very well.’ Augusta nodded. ‘I will continue.’ Carefully, she moved the electro-candles and the small refectorium effigy aside and laid her dataslate on the narrow central table. The slate’s glassy surface was already flowing with slowly scrolling maps. The squad moved closer to look. Using her quill, the Sister Superior pointed at the screen. For the benefit of the two new members, she said, ‘You are already aware that Vastum was a forge world, stripped of its resources, and then abandoned. During our prior mission here we discovered a concealed force that the departing Mechanicus had somehow overlooked.’ From somewhere, further out in the complex, the Terce hymnal rose into the pipework, making the metal sing, high and pure. Augusta continued, ‘The Imperial frigate Kyrus has been watching this force. She has also been scanning Vastum’s surface for any further caches of machines.’ The hymn rose to a crystal crescendo, a rise of thanks for the day, and for the coming confrontation. Augusta felt herself shiver – that familiar, glorious rush of battle-anticipation. She said, ‘And she has found them.’ ‘There are more?’ Akemi breathed. ‘In total,’ Augusta said, ‘six of Vastum’s one hundred and forty-four factoria have been found to contain a substantial force.’ For the benefit of the two new Sisters, she outlined, ‘Kataphrons – Breachers and Destroyers. Kastelans. A few Ironstriders. The Kyrus estimates two hundred single operational units.’ She paused, letting the squad catch up. ‘That’s quite an army,’ Melia commented, thoughtfully. ‘How do you overlook a force that large?’ Augusta said, ‘We are familiar with the enemy commander. We encountered the heretek Questor Rayos on our previous mission. And we have already witnessed that her machines are scratch-built, frequently lacking their full or correct armament.’ Augusta paused, looking around at her Sisters, their red shoulders framed by the Order’s banners. ‘Rayos was a trader in machine-parts and information,’ Akemi said, nodding. ‘She’s been building them.’ ‘Do not underestimate Rayos’ resources, or abilities,’ Augusta said. She nudged the dataslate and the map shifted. The squad leaned forwards, the screen’s illumination bathing their faces. Now, the illustration had changed. In close-up it was showing a ragged scatter of rough, dark blotches, tracing their way across the planet’s watery surface like a disease. Connecting several of these was a series of long and slowly curving black stripes. ‘This is a volcanic island chain,’ Augusta said, ‘connected by a series of roads. As we can see, this cluster here intersects with one of our occupied factoria. We,’ – she tapped the slate with the quill, indicating one of the dark islands at the cluster’s outermost edge – ‘are here. Forge temple and administratum zero-point-seven-seven.’ A whisper of hymn came through the pipes, ethereal and stirring. The hairs on Augusta’s neck stood on end. ‘At the other end of this island chain,’ Augusta said, ‘waits this planet’s primary citadel.’ A new light flared on the screen’s surface. ‘It covers approximately three square miles, and encompasses the main factorum as well as the central forge temple. It is also the only place upon this cesspit of a world that still holds an operational orbital launch–point. For the last two weeks, Rayos’ forces have been converging upon this location.’ ‘If they’re all in one place,’ Viola asked, ‘why doesn’t the Kyrus just launch an orbital strike?’ Alcina gave the red-haired Sister a sharp look, but Viola ignored her, still studying the screen. The Sister Superior answered, her words pointed. ‘The citadel is defended by an Emanatus force field. Our duty is to take that force field down. Sister Rhea,’ Augusta nodded at the newcomer, ‘has seen this device before, and will be able to identify and disable it.’ ‘In His name,’ Rhea said, ‘I will not fail.’ ‘We pray for His blessing, Sister,’ Augusta said. ‘The road between us and the citadel is over two hundred miles. The Kyrus reports that it is currently empty, but it may not remain so once we begin our advance. Please remember that we expect to be heavily outnumbered.’ She looked around at her Sisters, meeting each gaze, making sure they understood. ‘This is why the canoness’ adjutant, Sister Aitamah, has remained at the convent.’ Silence followed her words, and a chill breath stole through the metal room, stirring the hangings. The hymn had stopped, and its absence was suddenly echoing-loud. Viola’s hands tightened on the heavy bolter, and Akemi scribbled frantically on her dataslate. In the quiet, Sister Rhea was muttering the words of the litany, ‘A morte perpetua…’ Melia asked, her velvet voice cool, ‘Does Rayos have ships incoming?’ Augusta said, ‘Neither the Kyrus nor the Lux Sancta have reported incoming ships – but the canoness suspects it will not be long. The Lux Sancta has left orbit, and the Kyrus does not carry the armament for a battle, so we must move with speed.’ ‘Sister, may I ask a question?’ Akemi was running the numbers, assembling her data like she was a tech-priest herself. ‘We have seen that Rayos’ forces are scratch-built – do we have further details of her army?’ ‘We have the last known data from the Kyrus’ scans,’ Augusta told her. ‘We do not have the data from the citadel itself, as our scanners cannot penetrate the rock.’ The youngest Sister frowned at her dataslate, trying to work it out. ‘The canoness’ brief is very clear.’ Augusta picked up the screen and looked round at the five faces, her new squad, their armour glinting in the electro-candlelight. ‘We must reach the orbital platform before Rayos’ force can leave the planet. And if we must fight our way along every mile of road, then that is His will. ‘We face a trying battle, my Sisters. And may He be with us.’ Following the briefing, Augusta went to the Order’s chapel, one of the old forge temple’s transepts, now decorated with a full-sized embroidered banner depicting the God-Emperor Himself, His head haloed in Sol’s light, His flaming blade in hand. Around Him, the brass pipes had been cleaned, and carefully placed electro-candles made them shine like a promise. There was no servitor to take her weapons and she was under combat orders, but carrying them in His presence still felt wrong. Augusta walked up the short aisle and dropped to one knee, her head bowed. Her steel-grey hair fell forwards, hiding her face. ‘Tibi gratias ago tibi Imperatore.’ Thank you, my Emperor. With the briefings over and her orders clear, she had come to offer the Litany of Thanksgiving – for His judgment, and for the justice and wisdom of her Order. She had not realised how much she had feared the loss of her armour, and her honour. And there was no place for fear – or pride – in His presence. Only for service. She stayed kneeling for a moment, then came back to her feet, her head still bowed. A deep voice behind her said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The words were quiet, respectful. She turned, her boots scraping on the stone. Behind her, at the very edge of the transept, two figures were also rising. They were very young, their battered gear was brown and green and Militarum, and their lasrifles were held tight at their sides, like some third limb. One of them was long and lean and dark-skinned, the other shorter and stockier with a scar through his eyebrow. ‘Mors,’ she said, to the man who had spoken. ‘Rufus.’ The two soldiers were the last survivors of the deserter squad that had been guarding the doomed inquisitor. It had been Mors who had pulled the trigger and sent the sizzle of his lasrifle through Istrix’s unwary skull. Both men offered her the sign of the aquila. Gravely, she returned the salute. They glanced at each other with a flicker of awkwardness – they obviously wanted to say something, but they were two lone soldiers in the centre of a full deployment of the Adepta Sororitas, and they were both self-conscious and very out of place. Augusta said, ‘You wish to ask me a question, corporal?’ ‘No longer corporal, Sister,’ Mors said, ‘though the canoness has let us keep our gear.’ She stopped herself smiling at his rueful tone. ‘What do you need?’ ‘Sister…’ Mors glanced up at the embroidered banner and straightened his shoulders. ‘Rufus and I are assigned to your squad.’ ‘So I understand,’ she said. ‘And I’m glad to have you, both of you. You have proven your courage and faith many times.’ ‘Our orders are clear,’ Mors said. He pulled his shoulders back even further, let out his breath. ‘We’re still deserters, Sister, and we’re to offer our lives in the service of the Emperor.’ ‘Aye.’ Augusta nodded slowly, understanding. ‘You have been given the opportunity to attain redemption. To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. You should be proud.’ ‘We are,’ Rufus said. ‘We shot an inquisitor. It’s more than we deserve.’ Both men relapsed to their slightly awkward silence, and Augusta said, ‘The Order musters at Lauds, and we will commence our advance along the roadway. My squad have been assigned a Repressor, and we will take our position at the second line of the left flank. You will report to that location.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Return to your prayers, both of you,’ she told them. ‘I will expect you in the morning.’ As the soldiers returned to their kneel, Augusta squared her shoulders and turned to look up at the banner, its gold embroidery glittering like the pipework that surrounded it. He stared out over the transept, His face severe. To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. And the Sister Superior wondered… Had her squad been offered the same?",

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE A filthy, rust-red dawn. The hymn of Lauds, its close harmonies rising into the early morning dirt. ‘O Imperator, et Sol Iustitiae…’ O Emperor, the Sun of Justice… Lycheate’s aged, bloated star was still below the horizon, and the grubby brown sky was layered with clouds like brass and blood. Scoured by dusty wind, the Sisters’ muster point was a small black stone island, little more than an upthrust rock. Foul waters battered its jagged coastline, and all of its surrounding walkways had been collapsed, bar one. Its last metal bridge stood alone, creaking in the dawn wind. In front of the old forge temple steps, however, there stretched a flat expanse of hard standing, and, as the sun’s leading edge brought a flare to the sky, so an answering flash of scarlet came from the force that was assembled beneath it. Immolators, Repressors and Exorcists; twelve vehicles in perfect formation. Waiting. The hymn rose to a crescendo. ‘Imperator, nos hic ut laudis declate Tua!’ Emperor, hear us as we declare Your praise! Augusta, standing with her squad beside the hard red flank of their assigned Repressor, let her hands fall to her weapons. This was a celebration of the Emperor’s dawn, of the rise of Sol over distant Terra – a sight she had never seen, but one that still began her every day. Perhaps, one day, she would make the Pilgrimage… …if she were blessed enough. But today, she had another calling. To Augusta’s right, on the far side of their Repressor’s steel solidity, stood the Order of the Bloody Rose, its red banners flapping. In the lead, the four Immolators, commanded by Sister Mikaela. Behind them, the Immolator of the canoness herself, its pipes and banners shouting loud colours into the brown dawn. Then the rank of three Repressors, Augusta’s squad on the left flank, Eleni’s on the right, and Roku’s in the centre. Behind the Repressors, there waited Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim, their jump packs ready and rumbling. And lastly, at the very rear, four of the Sanctorum-pattern Exorcists, built on Ophelia VII and more reliable than the older Prioris models. The vehicles’ blaze of scarlet was powerful, as bright as new blood. This was the Rose, and it was ready for war. The Hymn of Lauds came to an end, the note like an expectation; the canoness’ vox-coder blasted clear trumpets, the clarion call of muster and battle. The assembled tanks began to growl, like canids on leashes. They sounded like they, too, were eager to encounter resistance. Feeling her adrenaline rise, Augusta uttered a prayer of her own… ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them!’ Standing in the back of her Immolator, her banner aloft, the canoness lifted her arms and her voice. ‘My Sisters!’ Across the vox-coder, her shout carried like a tantara. ‘Though we walk far from Terra, still we see His glorious dawn! Even at the farthest reaches of the Imperium, His light touches us and fills us with fire! We are His word, His will, His blade!’ Augusta felt her heart rate rise, felt the filthy wind sting her skin. Her breath was catching, now, on the metal tang that was Lycheate’s bitter atmosphere, that was war and retribution. Ianthe’s cry was a beacon. ‘And no foe – not heretic, not witch, not xenos – can withstand our wrath!’ As one, the company thundered, ‘We fear no heretic! We fear no witch! We fear no xenos!’ The tanks snarled their eagerness. Ahead of them waited the ferrocrete roadway, stretching long and bleak between the scatters of islands. Water lashed and clawed at its edges, and along its left-hand side ran a double line of servohauler tracks, rusted and unusable. The sun rose further, making the far horizon glitter, though its angles of metal were too distant to see clearly. The light swelled across the tanks’ scarlet gleam, and touched the canoness herself. Her ice-white hair became a pure, cold blaze. She was still shouting, calling out to their hearts and to their faith. ‘The lost forces of this forge world have been uncovered, and scavenged, and twisted to the powers of darkness! The war machines of Vastum, once warriors of the Omnissiah, now stand corrupted! And we will overcome them, Sisters. We will not permit the heretek Rayos to take her stolen army outwards to the void!’ Ianthe’s voice was absolute power, unassailable. Beneath it, now, music rose – the rousing sound of the Dies Irae. ‘We will not permit this heresy!’ The word emerged with the first drum-crash of the music. Augusta could see the flare of flame in the eyes of her Sisters; feel the light that lifted them all from within. The two soldiers stood at rigid attention, their rifles by their sides, their chins raised to the wind. ‘My Sisters!’ Ianthe gave one last, great shout. ‘We stand here by the Accords of Hydraphur – by the word of Saint Mina, by her blade and her courage. By the blessing of the God-Emperor and by His guidance! We are the Adepta Sororitas, and since the Age of Apostasy, our Sisters and we have stood at the gates to hell. Only we can stand sentinel here. And we say – enough!’ At the shout, hydraulics whined and the hatch of Augusta’s Repressor came down to provide a ramp. ‘Let this corroding world know the wrath of the Rose!’ One resounding response came from every throat. The Order, in unison, returned, ‘Ave Imperator!’ The sheer strength of it brought a shiver to the Sister Superior’s skin. She saw that Viola’s green eyes blazed; alight with ferocity. A final, held note from the vox-coder, and then a moment of prayer and quiet. The banners danced and snapped; water splashed at the rocks and hissed as it withdrew. At last, the canoness shouted, ‘Sisters… embark!’ ‘Ave Imperator!’ There was a single unified stamp of boots as the Order broke formation. And the mission began. Augusta’s squad knew the drill; they banged up the ramp to the cold metal of the Repressor’s belly. Metal seats lined its outside; tiny slits in the walls offered them a limited view and allowed them to fire at the enemy. Pauldrons scraped on steel as they sat. It was dim in there, and it smelled of oil and fervour. Between the window-slits the walls were inscribed with battle-prayers, and the engine’s zealous grumble reverberated through the metal. In the front of the vehicle sat a figure in scarlet under­armour, the padding overlain by plates of flexsteel that defended the wearer’s chest, shoulders and belly – drivers’ armour. She was not someone that Augusta knew. ‘Sister Superior,’ the young woman nodded, then turned back to the controls. ‘I’m Sister Cindal. May His grace and strength ride with us.’ ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Cindal,’ Augusta returned. ‘We place ourselves in your hands, and in His.’ In the vox-coder, the blare of trumpets sounded again. Ianthe’s voice: ‘Order… forward!’ And in the dirty red flare of the early morning light, the Sisters rolled onwards to war. At first, they met no resistance. The roadway was long, stretching silent over the wind-blown water, and it was desolate in its emptiness. This far from their target the tanks were moving at an easy three-quarter speed, fast enough to eat the distance but slow enough to react to an ambush, should one occur. The Seraphim jumped and swooped, short bursts of hit-and-run energy that conserved their fuel and allowed them to keep pace with the vehicles. Augusta would catch occasional flashes of scarlet as they came into view and then vanished again. As a younger woman she had harboured a deep wish to be amongst their number and had trained hard to hone her skills – but her dislike of heights had undone her. Her twinge of envy was unbecoming, and her place was His will. She turned back to the prayers along the inside of the tank. Slowly, the hours moved from Lauds to Prime, and the sun struggled upwards, weary and swollen. Slowly, lines of light from the window-slots moved across the tank’s interior. Outside, the filthy waters grew as wide as the horizon; they rolled and sloshed at the roadside, splashing garbage and remains. At the front of the company, the Immolators’ auspex searched for mines, and found nothing; above them, the Kyrus’ scans were constant and thorough. And the formation rolled onwards, keeping the dead servohauler tracks to its left. Augusta could only wait, and pray. She sat in the back of the Repressor, her Godwyn De’az-pattern bolter rested across her lap, her eyes watching the tiny passing slice of Lycheate’s polluted sea. This was the part of the battle that the Sister Superior disliked – she was restless, impatient. She wanted to be outside, singing, chainsword in hand, and cutting through the ranks of the enemy. ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ But that moment would come. She held herself still, calmly reciting the words of the litany and hearing her Sisters echo her, one line at a time. ‘Domine, libra nos.’ The tank rolled on, and the soft rumble of its tracks was like a heartbeat. Nothing, it seemed, was daring to stand in their way. ‘Company, halt.’ The vehicles stopped at the canoness’ vox command. Caught in the semi-dark, stuck in the chill belly of the Repressor, there was nothing Augusta could do. She could see a narrow slice of road and water, nothing else – no enemy, no target. Frustrated, she held her position, her bolter at the weapon-port, listening to the voices in her vox-bead. Mikaela reported from the lead Immolator, ‘Enemy sighted – two kastelans. Both stationary. One armed. They’re standing in the water, flanking the roadway. At a guess, milady, they’re lookout duty.’ ‘We will send Rayos a message of intent. Immolators, advance to heavy-bolter range, and halt,’ the canoness replied. Augusta’s Repressor was a transport and comparatively lightly armed – it held its position, its engine grumbling in protest. In its belly, the squad sat poised, their tension almost crackling in the air. Sister Mikaela’s voice came through the vox once more. ‘Within range. Enemy still motionless.’ ‘Immolators, heavy bolters, target the armed machine. Controlled, directed bursts. Conserve your ammunition, Sisters. And fire!’ the canoness ordered. Muffled by the Repressor’s steel shell, Augusta heard the heavy bolters’ booms and rattles, heard the hard, explosive detonations as the rounds struck their target. The air shook with repeated impacts. Her hands tight on her bolter, she craned to see, needed to know what was happening. But her only knowledge of the battle came from Mikaela over the vox. ‘Right-hand kastelan damaged. Both machines now in motion.’ ‘Same target. Fire!’ the canoness ordered. The bolters fired again, the sounds seeming to echo like ricochets through the inside of the tank. Augusta sat still, her shoulders tight, and saw that the others were doing the same. Viola, crouched at her weapon-port, moved her heavy bolter in an arc, seeking something – anything – to put in her sights. She wanted to fight; her recitation of the litany was full of suppressed rage. Mors and Rufus, likewise, had lasrifles ready to fire. They did not share the Sisters’ prayer, but they were remarkably steady, watching and waiting. ‘Incoming!’ Augusta held her breath. Somewhere ahead of them: one colossal boom. It struck the roadway, shaking their Repressor where it stood. She found herself trying to calculate – how far away the Immolators were, how much damage the kastelan could inflict. She knew the drill well enough – the Immolators would draw the enemy’s fire, ensuring the safety of the transports… Until the foot-troops could be effectively deployed. By the Throne! She wanted to be out there, not held helpless here in the half-light. In the vox, she could hear Mikaela praying, her voice livid with courage and fury. Annoyed by her enforced idleness, the Sister Superior echoed Mikaela’s words… That thou shouldst bring them only death! ‘Damage?’ the canoness asked. ‘Incendiary damage to the front plates, solidity still at eighty per cent,’ Mikaela replied. ‘The roadway has a crater, but the supports are holding – it’s shooting directly for us.’ ‘He is with you, Sister – trust in His wisdom,’ the canoness said, her words like the call of trumpets: ‘Same target. Fire!’ Again, the heavy rattle of bolters. There was the rasping grumble of tank tracks – the Immolators were moving, but Augusta couldn’t tell if it was forward or back. Her blindness was infuriating; her hand tightened even harder on the bolter. She needed to be out there, fighting for her Sisters, but still, she could feel the rush of His presence in the sounds of the battle, in her Order’s manoeuvring, and in the canoness’ experience… Someone behind Augusta – Rufus, she thought – muttered a savage expletive. She knew how he felt. ‘Machine down! Both legs damaged, it’s crashed into the water. Now fully submerged. The other one’s climbing onto the roadway.’ Once more, Ianthe thundered the command. ‘Fire!’ The rattle of the bolters sounded again, then Mikaela cried a prayer – pure, savage, celebration: ‘In nomine Eius!’ In His name! A second later, her report followed. ‘Machine down! I think we caught them by surprise.’ ‘Or they’re a warning, testing our mettle.’ The canoness’ tone was wry. ‘Either way, the enemy knows that we’re on the move, and it knows where we are – we must maintain full alertness. Is the roadway compromised, Sister?’ ‘No, milady,’ Mikaela said. ‘The damage is surface only and both kastelans are down. They’re fully submerged.’ ‘You’re strong, Mikaela. He walks at your side.’ The edge in Ianthe’s voice was keen. ‘Sisters, we must still expect to encounter the foe. Keep all scanners open. And may our hymns bring fear to the heart of the heretek.’ The vox crackled again, and went silent. In the semi-darkness of the back of the Repressor, Augusta commented to her squad, ‘Maintain your vigilance, my Sisters. The canoness is right – this is only the beginning.’ Standing in the back of the canoness’ Immolator, Sister Caia had heard every word. She stood at Ianthe’s shoulder, the glittering organ pipes and the Order’s blood-red banner rising behind her. The heavy reinforced fabric occasionally buffeted her shoulders, as if to remind her of this new duty, of its weight and seriousness. The wind was dirty and full of grit, and everything stank of cordite and promethium. Watching the rumble and muzzle-flash of the advancing tanks, Sister Caia gripped the edge of the cupola with one scarlet gauntlet, held her auspex in the other. She should be down there, alongside her Sisters. She should be waiting to disembark, to rage and fight and fire… But no. She had to stand here, above it, like she was forbidden to take part. And something about this new role was giving her a terrible and growing apprehension… Surely, not now, not after this long… They couldn’t… Could they? Even as far back as the schola, Caia had never spoken of her childhood, her family. She’d only ever wanted to be a warrior. I want to fight, to use my bolter for His glory, not… Ianthe, however, had offered her only a basic briefing: Caia had previous experience of the Lycheate forces, and she was here to observe. And that was all. Dominica’s eyes! Caia thought to herself. If my calling has changed, would it be blasphemy to refuse? Before the Immolator’s rumbling tracks the roadway was black and pitted, and stretched onwards as far as she could see. The kastelans had been stood like some sort of ancient guardians, one to either side of the road, and up to their knees in the water. The first one had been stubborn, refusing to fall despite significant damage – but its incendiary weapon had not penetrated the lead tank’s armour and it had proved no match for the Immolators’ heavy bolters. Both machines had been shot down and had splashed backwards, there to rot away. The Order’s first skirmish had been flawlessly executed, and it had brought courage to Caia’s heart. The canoness, however, was more thoughtful. Ianthe said, ‘Sister Caia. What is your assessment of the confrontation?’ Without hesitation, Caia answered, ‘Its execution was precise, milady.’ ‘And the enemy?’ Ianthe said. ‘Perimeter lookout. By their corrosion marks, they’ve been stood there for many years.’ ‘Good.’ She said nothing else, just turned back to the road. In the belly of the vehicle, Rhene, the old Hospitaller, cackled aloud. Her voice floated up to them, ‘You keep your eyes open, Sister Caia de Musa!’ Carefully, Caia answered her, ‘I will do my best, Sister.’ ‘You’d better!’ The old Hospitaller cackled again. ‘You never know what He might have in store for you!’ She tapped the side of her nose, and then, snorting with humour, dissolved into random mutterings. Caia’s tension twisted harder, becoming dark with fear. No, they can’t do this to me… Not now… Not after this long… The tanks rolled on. Caia stayed silent, watching her auspex. She must follow His calling, wherever it may lead. Yet, deny it though she might, the thin smoke of her tension remained. Lycheate’s metallic weather was capricious, and the wind had dropped as if torn from the sky. Around them, the water lay like dirty brass, still and flat. It stretched in all directions, oil-slicks gleaming like rainbows upon its surface; in places, the dead supports of fallen roadways emerged to spike at the sky. On the far horizon, the rusting metal silhouettes of the main factoria could just be seen, flashing in the light of the still-rising sun. The ruin of this place was huge, and hollow, and it stank. They rolled on. Slowly, the roadway broadened and became pocked with craters. More and more great scalloped bites had been taken from its edges, places where the ferrocrete had crumbled from the forces ranged about it. At one point, one of the supports had sagged completely and the road dipped almost to the waterline, though it remained intact. Here, the canoness gave orders to slow and progress with caution. As the vehicles dared the dip she prayed ceaselessly, her words strong and urgent – almost as if the vehicles’ grumbling spirits could hear her, and take courage. Her eyes were constantly narrowed; she watched the company’s formation intently, alert for the ambush. But there was nothing. Rayos, Caia knew, had complete confidence in her own calculations. However the Sisters advanced, the heretek would surely have factored it into her data. So, when the ambush came, it would be in the most effective place. The company traversed the dip successfully, and moved on. As Prime rose to Terce, however, and to midmorning prayers, they closed on the first factorum. Over the vox, Ianthe gave orders: ‘Distance: one mile. Slow to one-quarter speed, all scanners.’ As the vehicles slowed, she said, ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘Milady?’ The clouds were clearing now, but the air was still bitterly cold. Before them, the roadway had become significantly wider, flattening onto an island and encircled by jagged, volcanic spikes. Here, there was a junction – one side of the road turned right, and stopped at a clearly defined building, with distinct, square corners of glittering basalt. The other side, the main route, curved left and continued onwards over the water. The lines of the servohauler tracks likewise branched to follow both roads, and here, they gleamed with the oil of recent repair. Clearly, this was where the enemy’s territory began. The canoness said, ‘Your assessment please.’ Caia immediately responded: ‘They have cover, and the possibility of a flanking manoeuvre if we move forwards too far. If we are to be assaulted, then this is where that assault will take place.’ ‘My thoughts also,’ Ianthe said. ‘Captain?’ ‘Regrettably, canoness, the debris field is interfering with the Kyrus’ scans. I can see nothing in motion, but I fear I cannot give you more assurance.’ Ianthe nodded grimly, then said, over the vox, ‘Sister Mikaela. Situation?’ ‘My auspex shows nothing. Roadway and waters all reading as empty.’ ‘There may be a stationary force,’ Caia said. ‘The larger machines may be concealed by the water. Or perhaps something smaller and lighter, that the Kyrus would miss.’ ‘I agree,’ Ianthe said. Then, over the vox, she said, ‘Company, weapons ready, all scanners. Sister Nikaya, hold your position, be ready to jump on my command.’ ‘Milady,’ the Seraphim Superior answered. The company slowed further, crawling along the road. Below where Caia stood, Rhene began to sing the litany, her old voice thin and querulous. Unease prickled through Caia’s shoulders. The water glittered; the rocks were black as Ruin. In her ten years with her squad, Caia had developed an almost instinctive knowledge of these situations, a real awareness as to where the ambushes would occur… Her heart pounded. The banner flapped at her, nudging her shoulders as if taunting her with her new role. Rhene continued to sing. And then… There! ‘Contact! Multiple signals!’ shouted Mikaela. Caia’s estimation had been correct. Rayos, it seemed, had marshalled her first ambush.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR Sister Caia didn’t know what the machines were, but they were bipedal, long-legged and fast. The tanks were crawling slowly around the long curve in the road, and the Immolators had almost reached the junction. The servohauler tracks gleamed with intent, and upthrust jags of black rock were scattered to each side of the roadway, like a hill-range of spikes that protected the road from the water. Watching for the attack, the Sisters’ voices carried on the brown air – a bugle of challenge. And with them, a powerful counterpoint to their rising harmony, the canoness prayed, her voice a strong contralto, broadcasting the litany out through the vox-coder. ‘From the lightning and the tempest!’ The Immolators’ weapon-muzzles tracked back and forth, waiting. Then Caia said, like a breath of realisation, ‘Got them!’ Her auspex had blipped contact – four, no five, moving dots, all hidden among the rocks. Simultaneously, the Immolators caught the motion. As the machines came at them, the tanks’ weapons were already aiming. Caia had never seen their attackers before, but the canoness knew what they were. ‘Ironstriders.’ She said the word aloud, like a curse, then snapped into the vox, ‘Mikaela! Heavy bolters. Wide, continuous suppression, take as many of them down as you can. Repressors, halt and prepare to ­dis­embark!’ Reaching for her helmet, indicating for Caia to do likewise, she called down into the transport, ‘Rhene!’ The old Hospitaller creaked and grumbled. ‘Aye. I’ve seen autocannons before.’ Her tone sounded like resignation – as if she knew full well the damage these guns could do. And, as Caia closed the seal on her helm, she saw them open fire. She closed her teeth on a curse. Fast repeated muzzle flashes, oddly pale in the burnished ochre of the Lycheate morning. The weapons were heavy and long, their muzzles tracking from raised shields. An energy crackled about them, a mist of data that must surely be coming from Rayos herself; they shot at the Sisters while the machines were still running. It made their aim erratic, but– Throne! Heavy explosive rounds chewed up the roadway directly in front of the canoness’ Immolator. Ianthe snarled the litany in return, raging at them, almost as if she could deflect the ammunition by her faith alone. The other machines were aiming at the front rank, rounds hitting and detonating on thick ceramite armour. One hit a heavy bolter with perfect accuracy, and the weapon blossomed in flame. Metal graunched, plates buckled, tracks split and broke. On the right flank, Eleni’s Repressor took a clean hit. Even as its emergency ramp crashed to the floor, one of its twin thermic reactors ignited and blew. The force of the explosion rocked Caia where she stood; she made an effort not to duck. Shrapnel whistled past her; black smoke rose and billowed, obscuring her view. ‘Squad! Roll call!’ Eleni said over the vox. The canoness barked, ‘Watch your auspex, Sister Caia! There may be more.’ ‘Aye.’ Prayer and adrenaline thundered through Caia’s blood. She was trying to see Eleni through the smoke, but it was heavy and thick, and it hung like a shroud over the dead vehicle. She saw only isolated flashes of scarlet. In the fog, though, her auspex continued to track. Five blips were rapidly closing their distance on the assembled Sisters, and the Immolators had a swiftly shortening field of fire. Rayos, Caia realised, had calculated her ambush perfectly. ‘Mikaela!’ The canoness called the order. ‘Fire!’ A booming rattle as the tanks’ heavy bolters opened up. The smoke was billowing across the roadway now, limiting visibility, but Caia could see that the weapons were turning in an arc, hitting the enemy in the legs. Machine-armour sparked, rounds missed and exploded on the rocks. A rush of stone rumbled to the ground; the noise and dust were tremendous. As the smoke closed over the scene completely, she caught one machine toppling sideways, kicking and twitching. But the other four were still running, straight at the assembled Order. They had pilots, she thought, and she wondered briefly where the servitors had come from… But there was no time. Another order boomed through the vox: ‘Repressors, disembark!’ Behind them, the vehicles’ ramps crashed to the ground. Voices shouted, boots clanged on metal, and two armed squads of Sisters deployed in perfect formation, heavy bolter first, covering the others as they took position. Seeing them move, Eleni’s squad formed with them – a single line, five paces apart, heavy bolter at one end, flamer at the other. Spreading the machines’ targets, and making the autocannons’ success that much harder. In just a moment, the enemy would be past the front rank of vehicles, and closing on the Sisters. Caia found herself holding her breath. She felt very exposed, standing up there in the open, but the canoness showed no inclination to move. Ianthe stood like an icon, fire-red and furious, her plasma pistol ready in her hand as if she would wield pure destruction. She thundered, out over the vox-coder, ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them!’ A single shot from her pistol and an Ironstrider was toppling over itself, its entire head removed. Molten metal spread out across the roadway. Above it, the air was filling with trumpets and dirt and noise – the ongoing clatter of the tanks’ bolters, the heavy blasts of the explosive ammunition. The canoness was broadcasting the full litany, now, hard and strong, defiant. Her rage was palpable, and Caia breathed a prayer, feeling her own blood surge and roar. She wanted to be down there, bolter in hand. She looked for her squad; saw them at the outer left flank, their line made distinctive by the las-streaks of the two young soldiers. Mors and Rufus had their rifles tucked into their shoulders and aimed clean at the incoming enemy. Two figures of green in the centre of all that blood-red ceramite – but neither of them so much as twitched. Caia had only a split second to take all of this in, and then the command rang out, ‘Immolators, cease! Infantry, target the servitors. And fire!’ One solid volley: three squads, in unison, shot upwards at the running machines. In the onslaught of noise, Caia could pick out the deep, thunderous battering that was Viola’s thrice-blessed heavy bolter, the weapon raging as the litany came from the Sisters themselves. The canoness was pistol-in-hand, her voice lifted, and Caia found her hackles rising with the force of the moment. Another machine staggered under the incoming fire. It lurched, sparks racing across its surface, but it didn’t fall. Amid the confusion, Caia saw the twin streaks of red light that came from Mors and Rufus both; saw one of them hit a servitor, clean to the head. The figure rocked in its gunnery seat, toppled, and fell. Blood and oil splashed outwards as it struck the roadway. More smoke billowed in Caia’s face, and she lost her vision. As it cleared again, she saw that the machine had run two more paces and then had lost its heading, barging into its fellows and knocking them aside. Mors, Caia realised, blinking, was an extremely good shot. Watching, her breath held, she prayed that the staggering machine would falter, take its comrades with it when it fell, but it rapidly regained its trajectory and continued to run, straight at the Sisters. Its autocannon, however, had slumped forwards and ceased to fire. All three of the surviving machines were now closing on the standing lines of infantry. Before them, a red line across the black road, Sisters stood fearless and fast, still shooting, still singing, their close harmonics edged with focused rage. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death!’ Caia found herself echoing their words, repeating them over and over again – only death, only death – like a mantra. She had never seen a battle from a tank’s vantage, and she found her heart thumping hard in her chest. She wanted to be shooting, wanted to be on the ground. She wanted to be out there, amid the smoke and the noise and the slaughter; she wanted to stain her armour with the blood of her foe… She wanted to rage denial against this feared, final fate that was finally closing down upon her, the thing she’d dreaded since she’d been a wet-eared novitiate… I was called to be a warrior, and a warrior I will stay! As two of the three incoming machines opened fire, she saw one red-armoured figure fall, then another – but not her own squad, they were still on their feet. The smallest figure, Akemi, had stopped to change her magazine, the movement smooth as reflex. A second later, she was firing again, her bolter held hard in both hands, her aim true. Caia’s hands tightened on her auspex and bolter both… ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none!’ In front of her, the canoness shot again; she broadcast anger and defiance with her every sung note. In the belly of the tank, however, Rhene had stopped singing. She was muttering aloud, almost to herself, ‘Ironstriders. They’re sharpshooters, seen ’em before. On Melecantha. They ambushed us. So why are they running?’ Without thinking, Caia replied, ‘They’re trying to get behind us. There must be another wave!’ Ianthe barked, ‘Exorcists, on my command. Caia, watch that auspex!’ ‘Aye.’ Caia’s acknowledgement was echoed over the vox, and she lifted the auspex, watching. And it seemed her hunch had been right – the attacking machines weren’t slowing down. Two autocannons tracked round as they ran, and again, opened fire. One targeted the canoness. The other aimed straight for Sister Viola. On the ground, Augusta held her position, bolter and chain­sword in hand. She stood at the centre of her squad’s line, Mors on one side, Alcina on the other. Viola stood on the line’s inside, and Melia at its outermost edge – this was not a battle for flamers. Echoing the canoness’ thundered song, the Sister Superior’s voice reached a crescendo as Mors hit the servitor, but the machine was still running with its fellows, through the rising smoke and straight at them. In all the clouds of dirt, it took Augusta a split second to realise that the machine that had been hit was not firing. Without its pilot, it was simply following its last command, and, with His blessing, it would run straight off the edge of the road. She dismissed it, concentrating on the one closest. If that turning autocannon hit them, they would all be facing the Emperor. But Viola was still shooting, the booming clattering of the heavy bolter filling the filthy air. Shouting the words of the litany, she raised her aim as the thing came closer, shooting upwards and almost into its belly. It juddered under the bombardment, explosions opening like wounds all over its frame, but still, it kept coming. Its feet were big enough to crush Viola clean to the ground. Mors shot it again, his aim not as blessed, and his streak of fire went wide. Rufus was shouting something at him, though Augusta couldn’t hear. She said to Alcina, beside her, ‘Give me room.’ Alcina shot her a sharp look, but moved. As the thing readied itself to fire, the Sister Superior held her chainsword ready. To their right, the other running machines were keeping pace with their fellow. One was closing on the canoness’ Immolator, the other on the far flank. Augusta could only see them as a blur from the corner of her eye, but she knew what was coming. The running machines opened fire together, the autocannons seeming to shake the very sky. On the far flank, scarlet armour scattered, figures were thrown in the air like toys. In the centre, the machine chewed more holes in the roadway; the canoness’ Immolator rocked, but that was all. And in front of the squad… The autocannon was aimed at Viola, identifying the greatest threat. As it fired, its muzzle flaring with light, Viola hurled herself bodily backwards, still shooting. In front of her, the roadway became a series of craters, and steam and debris leapt into the air. Cursing, Viola rolled into a kneel. Still, she kept shooting. In the vox, the canoness: ‘Roku, right-hand machine, all bolters. Nikaya, right flank!’ Augusta heard the order, and understood that the Seraphim were moving to protect Eleni’s weakened squad, but the machine was almost on them now. She watched its foot rise, timed it as it came down, its impact shaking the road… Lashed out with the chainsword, straight at its ankle. The blade hit, bit, and got stuck. A second later the running foot raised once more, wrenching her shoulder and elbow and tearing the weapon from her grip. Grit scattered; she bit back a curse. She raised the bolter with the other hand, opened fire. Beside her, Alcina did the same. Rounds thundered; twin streaks of lasgun fire cut through the smoke. The combined shooting of the whole squad battered the thing as it ran through them, and closed on the Exorcists behind. And then, the damage was just too much. Its armour dented and blackened, its autocannon now blocked by its own body, it lurched and began to stagger. ‘It’s going to fall!’ The shout was Akemi, as the Ironstrider twitched, rocked, and then slowly toppled away from them. Augusta breathed a prayer of gratitude. As it fell, the crash was tremendous. Its servitor rolled free, but Melia was already there and a single flaming whoosh melted flesh and metal alike. A sickening, smoking smear was left on the roadway. Ash blew on the wind. Augusta went to retrieve her chainsword. With servitor and machine both down, she was already thinking about the rest of the battle. ‘Incoming!’ Caia cried the word aloud as five more contacts blipped on her auspex. ‘No – not incoming, they’ve stopped.’ The first wave of machines was down; the sheer, continuous onslaught of the combined bolter fire had just proved too much. Around the company, the roadway was devastation, pitted with craters, smeared by smoke and drifting with rising dirt. Four machines lay in ruins, their armour and pieces scattered. The fifth had simply run straight over the outermost curve of the roadway and vanished into the water. Not one of them had made it through the company to reach the other side – but the inflicted damage had been severe. At the right flank, Eleni’s squad had lost their Repressor, its driver, and two Sisters; a third was badly injured. Covered by the Seraphim, Eleni and her surviving squad-member had picked up the injured woman and had run for the canoness’ Immolator. Rhene, still grumbling, had lowered the ramp for long enough to let them embark, and then closed it again. Her muttering continued as she tended to the downed Sister. ‘Sister Roku.’ The canoness’ bark was unaffected by the damage. ‘Move outwards, defend the right flank. We’ll hold the centre.’ ‘Understood.’ On the left flank, Augusta’s squad was unhurt, but in the centre, the canon­ess’ vehicle had taken significant fire – its top and front armour plates were badly damaged, and although the storm bolter was still operational, it would no longer turn fully through its right-hand arc. The brass pipes of the organ were a mess, and the company’s banner was in shreds – but these seemed the least of the canoness’ concerns. ‘Locations,’ she said. ‘Caia?’ ‘They’re on the rocks,’ Caia told her. ‘Two on the right, three on the left.’ She could see them – just – perched like predators, and silhouetted against the sky. ‘Extreme range.’ The canoness’ words were a statement, and rapidly followed by an order, ‘Immolators and Repressors, hold your locations. Exorcists, on my command.’ Wryly, Caia looked at the mess ahead of them. The various fallen machines had all but blocked the roadway – not Rayos’ original plan, perhaps, but effective nonetheless. But the canoness, it seemed, was unworried. ‘Sister Jolantra! Ready missiles.’ Sister Jolantra was the commander of the Exorcist unit that guarded the company’s rear. It also, Caia knew, had the range to strike. But, as the vox-coders began to broadcast again, the trumpet call that was the muster, the call to battle, the five waiting Ironstriders raised their autocannons at the company. And they opened fire.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Ironstriders had the range, the vantage, and a clear field of fire. The assembled Order had no cover. The canoness barked at Caia to duck, shoving both of them into the belly of the Immolator and slamming the hatch as the echoing boom of autocannons filled the air. Assailed by the noise, rocks cracked, rumbled and fell. They hit the roadway, splintering into fragments; the metal-flat water geysered with repeated impacts. On the right flank, Sister Roku’s squad had barely re-embarked before their Repressor was slammed with explosive incoming rounds. Roku was not intimidated. Her voice rang furious, singing the Dies Irae. On the left, Augusta and her squad were knocked to the floor of their vehicle, falling on top of one another as the thing lurched into motion through a thundering hail of fire. In the centre, Caia likewise hit the floor of the Immolator, nearly knocking Rhene to the ground. Kneeling over the injured Sister, Rhene snapped at her to watch herself and went back to her charge. The injured woman had caught a spray of shrapnel in her belly, and the wound was bleeding heavily. She made no sound, but her chestplate was off, and gore seeped out through her underarmour. It leaked, steaming, across the cold metal floor. Oblivious of the blood, Sister Superior Eleni knelt at the woman’s other side, gripping her gauntleted hand in both of her own. Her helm was off, and sweat matted her blonde hair. It slid down her skin, glittering, outlining the edges of her tattoo. She was praying for strength, for His light and mercy, and she was echoed by her squad’s only other survivor, who sat against the vehicle’s side, her flamer over her knees. Caia joined them, the prayer bringing a flare of anger. She felt almost guilty at the woman’s injury, felt that she should have done more, been out there to defend her. By the Throne, she didn’t want to be in here, hiding – she wanted to be fighting, firing, bringing wrath and retribution… Her nervousness was crystallising, becoming anger about its edges. Not only anger at the enemy, but anger at her situation. Questions plagued her, flickering like prayers. Was this because of Zale, the witch? Had he touched her, too, with his heresy? Were her squad really here to redeem themselves in death, like the two doomed soldiers? And if so, then why had she been separated? If they were to die, then surely, she should be with them! Or have I not proven myself worthy enough? Ianthe’s voice cut across her thoughts. ‘They have excellent aim,’ she said. ‘If they wanted to, they could take both of us, clean from the top of the vehicle.’ Raising her voice, she called out across the vox-coder: ‘Stand fast, my Sisters! His light is with us! We do not fear death! We do not fear pain! We will fight with the last round in every weapon, with the last breath in every body! For the Emperor!’ ‘The debris field is clearing. Full scan of the factorum in ninety solar seconds,’ Captain Mulier announced aboard the Kyrus. ‘Ninety seconds.’ The canoness muttered the words aloud. She had a grin like a blade, sharp and gleaming and utterly mirthless; one fist was clenched like she could take on the Ironstriders with her gauntlet alone. She snapped, ‘Exorcists! Fire!’ Caia couldn’t see the missiles as they streaked across the filthy brown sky, but she could hear the detonations as they hit. And she could imagine the machines rocking and falling, the explosive craters blown in the basalt, the debris and rock and metal and flesh as it was flung in every direction, the plumes of superheated smoke… She continued to pray with Sister Eleni, listening, and watching the auspex in her hand. The explosions were moving past them, backwards through the company. She heard her Sisters curse as the shells found their new targets, and fell upon the Exorcists. And then, from almost directly behind them, came the unmistake­able detonation of promethium fuel. A brief scream sounded in the vox, half-shriek, half-prayer. Livid with fury, the canoness’ voice grew louder, thunderous and proud. Caia, too, prayed like a woman demented. ‘We beseech Thee!’ On her feet, her pistol still in her hand, Ianthe barked, ‘Reload! Again!’ A rumble of rubble seemed to shake the roadway. Sister Jolantra, in the leading Exorcist, remarked, ‘One down!’ Then paused. ‘Two!’ Another pause, letting the music fill the almost breathless wait. ‘And by His grace – another one crushed by the rocks. Three!’ The canoness’ grin grew. Caia kept praying, feeling the words surge in her blood; Ianthe was looking up at the hatch as though she would leap out of it, descending on the machines with weapon in hand and the wrath of the Saint herself… The heavy boom of the remaining autocannons continued, now focused exclusively on the Exorcists as the greatest threat. A third volley of missiles arced over their heads, and Sister Jolantra snarled, ‘Four!’ Briefly, the last autocannon rattled on alone. There was a rumble of falling rocks, and it fell silent. ‘Five!’ Jolantra’s voice rose in a shout, a savage paean of victory and thanks. The gunfire had stopped, and the grumble of the Immolator’s engine seemed suddenly loud. Caia stood up, but Ianthe was already moving, opening the hatch above her head and scrambling up to look out at the battle. Captain Mulier said, ‘Scan in twenty seconds… Nineteen…’ ‘The roadway looks clear. Sister Caia?’ the canoness asked. ‘Nothing moving,’ Caia said. She jumped up, and looked round to assess the damage. ‘By His light!’ The words were a breath. Sister Caia was no neophyte. She and Melia had served together as novitiates, and they had taken their Oath of Ordination at the same time. They had joined Augusta’s squad ten years before, had seen the savage death-green glow of the necrons at Psamitek, and the clicking seethe of massed tyranids, their rip and claw and hunger. They’d seen the graceful fury of the aeldari on Basilissica, the muscle and mockery of the orks on Lautis. They’d faced the slaver of daemons, their whips and teeth and laughter; they’d seen the roil and flare of the very warp itself… But Caia had never been to war alongside her assembled Order, never seen her Sisters dying in numbers, nor such devastation as Rayos’ machines could inflict… She steadied herself on the edge of the hatch. ‘We are strong, Sister,’ Ianthe said. ‘He is with us. Can you not feel His anger? Taste it in the smoke on the air? Understand His joy and wrath in the exaltation of pure combat?’ The canoness’ voice was like a plucked string, deep and strong and vibrant, and laden with blood and power. The vox-coder broadcast, ‘Sisters! We claim victory in the name of the God-Emperor! We will not let these defiled machines stand in our way!’ The ruined banner at her back, Caia answered, along with her Sisters, ‘Ave Imperator!’ The shout carried skywards, its force almost enough to make a whorl of currents in the floating dirt. The roadway, however, was a jumble of confusion. Amid the drifting smoke, Caia could see the devastation – the pieces of red armour, the strewn fragments of the downed Ironstriders. The damage to the ferrocrete road was severe, pockmarks and craters marking where multiple rockfalls had tumbled after the Exorcists’ missiles had hit. Sister Jolantra, it seemed, had been targeting the overhanging stone as much as the attackers themselves. Mikaela’s Immolator was already rumbling over the top of the mess, crushing all beneath the vehicle’s relentless tracks. Caia checked her auspex, but there was nothing else in motion. Captain Mulier barked. ‘Five… Four… Three…’ She breathed a prayer… ‘And clear,’ Mulier said. ‘As far as I can tell, milady, the factorum is empty.’ ‘The Ironstriders must have waited, and then run out to meet us,’ Ianthe answered grimly. ‘But, as the Treatise says, He defends those best who defend themselves… We will pause to make sure.’ Augusta’s orders were clear – the vehicles would secure and hold the junction, and she and her squad were to disembark and scout the empty factorum on foot. They were not to engage, they were just to observe and report. If there were any threat remaining, they would ensure its final destruction. As the Order closed the gap upon its mission target, nothing could be left at its back. ‘Understood.’ In the back of their Repressor, Augusta relayed the new orders to her squad, and to the two waiting soldiers. Viola pulled a face, thought better of it, and stayed quiet. ‘We move in three solar minutes,’ Augusta said, shooting a warning look at the red-haired Sister. ‘Aye,’ Viola replied. The Sister Superior was very aware of Sister Alcina, standing with her arms folded and her expression flat. Alcina had not been impressed by Augusta’s attempt to take down the Ironstrider by striking at its foot, though she was disciplined enough to say nothing. Augusta had the uncomfortable sensation, however, that Alcina was still watching her. Watching all of them. ‘Sister?’ she asked. The Repressor jerked untidily sideways as it crushed rock and machine beneath its progress. Augusta caught at the roof to keep her feet. From the front, Sister Cindal called, ‘Auspex still clear, advancing on target. Ramp will drop in two minutes.’ Alcina said, ‘I will speak to you privately, Sister. When we have a moment. The enemy is our first priority.’ Augusta gave her a long, steady look, but offered no further response – this was a combat situation, and not the time. When Alcina finally dropped her gaze, the Sister Superior nodded, then said, ‘Viola and Rhea, take point. Melia, take rear. Mors, with me. Rufus, with Sister Akemi. We will enter by the side access and follow the left-hand wall, staying under cover of the balcony and the empty hoppers. If anything moves, we observe and report, and we await further orders.’ The Repressor’s engines slowed, and the vehicle came to a stop. Cindal said, ‘Still nothing, Sisters. Twenty seconds ’til I drop the ramp.’ ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘May His light follow us into the darkness. May His wisdom watch our pathway.’ Cindal said, ‘Three seconds, Sisters.’ The ramp’s green light flashed, its hydraulics whined. And even before it hit the ground, Viola and Rhea were moving, their cohesion smooth and easy. But a new problem had developed. The factorum’s concourse was gritty with black ash and fine, metallic sand. In the aftermath of the battle, it had been stirred to wakefulness by the ripples of rising heat, obscuring the Sisters’ preysight and limiting their field of vision. Viola reached the bottom of the ramp with a curse, and dropped to a kneel, her heavy bolter aimed out across the factorum’s foreground – what she could see of it. Rhea followed the motion, letting Viola run forwards once more. Their deployment was faultless, a movement completed a thousand times. ‘Can’t see a damned thing.’ The curse was Rufus. ‘Could be anything moving in all this!’ Augusta barked, ‘Suit-lights!’ Six beams of light glimmered through the billowing dirt as the squad followed, weapons in hands. Atop the Repressor, the storm bolter was tracking, covering them, but there was nothing to see. Augusta said, ‘Sister Rhea?’ Her long form like a bloodied smear, Rhea returned, ‘Nothing, Sister Superior. No motion.’ ‘Keep scanning,’ Augusta said. Six Sisters and two soldiers moved swiftly – five paces, and kneel, five paces, and kneel. Dependent completely upon Rhea and her auspex, they moved towards the left-hand side of the building, their suit-lights picking out the glimmers of mica and obsidian, buried in the rock, the twin gleam of the servohauler rails. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. The building loomed high, identical in shape to the previous factorum, the one in which they’d caught Scafidis Zale. This time, however, it lacked the attaching metal walkways, and its left-hand side was butted up hard against the rock. The area provided a lee of shelter, and as they came closer, their vision cleared and they could make out the door that Augusta had meant. It bore a line of binary numerals and a cog-and-skull symbol that they’d seen before. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi said. The word seemed heavy, its syllables like rocks, rolling onwards through the dust. ‘Rayos’ home forge world,’ Augusta commented. ‘She must have known all this was here,’ Melia said. ‘Why else did she come to this planet?’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta responded. ‘Many of these machine-parts must be centuries old.’ They moved onwards, and saw that the servohauler tracks ended at a huge and echoing depot, empty and dug backwards into the cold rock wall. ‘She must have worked hard, to rebuild this army.’ ‘We estimate that Rayos has been here for maybe two decades,’ Akemi said. ‘I do not clearly understand the ways of machine-spirits, but she must have worked hard indeed to build this many machines in that short a time.’ The air in the depot was still; there were no engines, nothing. The lines of tracks gleamed in mockery and an odd chill went down the Sister Superior’s spine. This many machines… It was a glint of suspicion like the tip of a blade, caught in a poorly healed wound… That short a time. But the depot offered no answers. At Augusta’s order, Viola and Rhea reached the door to the factorum, and stopped. Unlike the various heavy double doors that allowed the machines themselves into and out of the building, this one was normal size – for servitors, helots and tech-priests. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. ‘If the Kyrus’ scans are correct, this factorum was emptied more than two weeks ago.’ Sister Alcina muttered in the vox, ‘I dislike this, Sister.’ ‘I hear you,’ Augusta agreed. Then, ‘Quietly if you can, Sisters. The Emperor rewards caution.’ Carefully, Rhea reached out. The door didn’t move. She tried again, then stepped back, and, with little effort, struck it with one red boot. It sprang open, slamming backwards, and Viola was already through it, her heavy bolter and suit-light covering the space inside. But there was nothing there. Nothing moved. Nothing opened fire. No lights glared, no sirens wailed… ‘Of course,’ Augusta commented, straight-faced, ‘He also rewards audacity.’ Muttering the words of the litany, she gave the order to advance. The factorum was empty. The space was huge, covered in the dust of centuries. And yet that dust had been tracked with recent movements and shifted into patterns – there had been something here, and not very long ago. The squad spread out in twos, taking Rufus with them. Augusta kept Mors at her shoulder – the young ex-corporal had more experience of this planet than any of the Sisters, and might offer insight where they could not. Confronted with the deserted expanse of the factorum floor, however, he shook his head. ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ he said. ‘I can only offer what we already know. Rayos has removed her force from this location.’ He paused, then added, ‘Permission to speak freely?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘Sister, her force is fully assembled. I fear… I feel that we are wasting our time. We should strive to reach our target before Rayos’ force can be moved off-world.’ ‘Aye.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘But the Kyrus will warn us if anything else enters orbit above the platform.’ Mors did not argue. ‘Yes, Sister.’ They went back to pacing the vast and empty space, trying to piece together the movements from the marks in the dust – but it was almost impossible. The exploring Sisters answered their roll calls, one pair after another. They, too, were finding nothing. At last, Augusta and Mors came to a stop before the one point in the factorum that had really caught their interest. A shrine. A Mechanicus shrine, clearly the factorum’s main place of worship – to Augusta it looked more like a miniature workshop, a place of pict-screens and pipes and furnaces and maintenance. Binary prayers were embossed in its metal walls and, under them, there were other marks that were clearly machine dialect, something that she could not read. She called for Akemi, and continued to look. The area was clean, clear of the ever-present metallic dust; it had recent oil stains where machines had been assembled or repaired. It also bore a cog-and-skull, one that they were starting to find familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Augusta said. ‘Again.’ She stood looking at it, and then realised something else. ‘This one is more recent than the mark on the door.’ ‘By some considerable time.’ Mors ventured an agreement, his hands gripped round his lasrifle, the weapon tucked hard into his shoulder. He was watching the empty factorum, as if convinced that they’d missed something. ‘Am I correct in recalling, Mors,’ Augusta said, ‘that Rayos had scarred over the mark of her home world?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ he said. ‘I recall the same thing.’ ‘She is a heretek. She has abandoned her world, denied it. So why would she make its mark in her workshop?’ He blinked. ‘I do not know.’ Augusta said nothing, and continued to examine the shrine. There was little else to see – a small stacked data-bank, a forgotten cogitator, a hanging line of basic tools and attachments, all of them clean and recently used. Akemi arrived at a run, Rufus with her. The young medicae had caught a shrapnel-cut across the side of his face, and the field-dressing seeped with red. ‘Sister Superior?’ Augusta pointed a red-armoured finger. ‘The machine dialect, Sister Akemi, what does it say?’ Akemi had almost taken her Oath of Ordination to the Order of the Quill, and her linguistic skills were formidable. Machine dialect, however, was a difficult task for a human, no matter how good their education. She said, ‘I fear I can read very little of it, Sister–’ ‘Try.’ Augusta’s word was an order. Akemi turned her suit-light on the text, and frowned. After a moment, she said, ‘Toll the great bell… Sing praise… the God of all… It’s a prayer for maintenance, for the reconstruction and accession of broken machine-spirits…’ She paused, then said, ‘No – not reconstruction. Creation.’ She started to explain the difference in phraseology, but Augusta stopped her with a raised hand, and she finished, ‘This is a birth-prayer.’ ‘A birth-prayer?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘This shrine was not created by this world’s original tech-priests. It’s a place for remaking, for joining parts of a spirit to make a new whole.’ She paused. ‘I do not know if this is heresy.’ ‘That surely depends on the parts,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak – though she, too, did not understand enough of the ways of the Omnissiah, nor of the heretek. Akemi had confirmed her suspicion, however, acknow­ledged that blade-spike of aggravation that was biting into her thoughts… ‘There is something else here,’ she said. ‘And I am beginning to suspect that it, too, once came from Incaladion.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX With the factorum declared secure, the canoness called muster. Leaving two of the Exorcists to watch the road, the company moved to take advantage of the empty depot. The vehicles turned around, the manoeuvre smooth and practised, and then halted, their engines still running. Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim paused to refuel, and then moved from squad to squad, assessing their damage and speaking to each Sister Superior in turn. And, as they did so, Ianthe addressed them all from the top of her Immolator, the stone roof making the vox-coder echo like thunder. ‘My Sisters! This road is bleak and long, but with His blessing, we have come far! The God-Emperor strides at our side, and the corrupted machines cannot stop us! We bring wrath, and fire! We bring the light of Holy Terra to the darkness that is Lycheate! Stand fast, my Sisters, and walk tall!’ She paused, looking round at the waiting tanks. ‘The heretek Rayos has tested our mettle, and she will test us again. We may face another ambush, or mines along the roadway. And if, by the Emperor’s grace, we reach the citadel without mishap, then we will still face a considerable assembled force. Captain Mulier, aboard the Kyrus, is watching the roadway with orbital eyes, and we will be ready for any eventuality!’ She paused, and Caia looked out at the red ranks of vehicles – two now missing where the Ironstriders had struck, many more showing the char-marks and buckled plates of the autocannons’ impacts. The canoness went on, ‘Thanks to the wisdom of Sister Superior Augusta, we also now believe that Rayos is not working alone – she is likely to be working for, or with, an older power, possibly another Incaladion heretek.’ Another pause, but the only response was engine noise – vehicles snarling with the eagerness to be off. ‘We will identify and execute both Rayos and her collaborator. ‘Show courage, my Sisters! Unfurl your faith like a banner and carry it high in the wind!’ Ianthe spread her arms and turned to take in all of them, as if she led and offered courage to each Sister, to each vehicle, individually. ‘We carry the heart and the torch of the Order of the Bloody Rose! We carry the courage of Mina herself. We carry the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. We carry His name, and His glory, and we know no fear! Ave Imperator!’ In response, the Sisters gave a single, thundered, ‘Ave Imperator!’ Echoing the salute, Sister Nikaya gave the Repressor a stern nod as she passed – her personal check of each squad had been completed. The information, Caia guessed, would be communicated over a tight-beam link to the canoness alone. Vox-coder trumpets blared, and Ianthe blazed, ‘Forward!’ The engines rumbled their anger, and the company rolled onwards once more. Caia stood in the cupola, her auspex in her hand. Leaving the junction and the empty factorum behind them, the ranks of the Order, still in formation, drove out along the curving black road. The enemy knew that they were coming, and the Sisters raged their defiance. They broadcast the Dies Irae like a dare. Quantus tremor est futurus! The vehicles kept a strong but steady speed, the lead vehicle’s auspex constantly scanning the roadway ahead. There were fewer islands now, just a scattering of upthrust rocks, and the road itself hung over the limitless foul waters like some vast and endless bridge, a long line of industry and achievement that led onwards to the distant horizon. The Seraphim returned to their jump-pattern, and the hard chant of the hymn was a known thing – it rang out with wrath, solid and reassuring. To Caia, it felt powerful, lifting her chin and her heart and reminding her that, no matter how huge the acid sea, His presence travelled with them, in word, in deed, and in weapon. Their enemy awaited them, and they would not fail. As they rolled onwards, however, they began to encounter a new difficulty. Following another of its impulsive mood swings, the planet’s weather was deteriorating. The fat Lycheate sun had struggled its way to past mid-morning, and now the roiling brown cloud was rolling back in to smother its light. Corrosive, glutinous rain was beginning to scatter across tank and roadway alike. And where it struck, it hissed. Defended by their armour, both the canoness and Sister Caia remained standing in the back of the Immolator, the banner behind them now hanging in soggy tatters. Steadily, the rainwater ate at the fabric. Below them, in the belly of the vehicle, the injured Sister was sitting up and away from the hatch – and stridently declaring her fitness. ‘I can sit unassisted, thank you, Sister Hospitaller. Where is my weapon?’ Caia could hear Rhene grumbling, ‘You young women, never think to duck. What do they teach you in the schola? The Emperor is all-seeing, Sister Abril, but even He won’t stop an autocannon if it hits you square in the chest. How does that Treatise of yours go?’ The muttering continued, and Caia, startled by the old Hospitaller’s near-blasphemy, was even more surprised to see Ianthe turn and almost smile. Catching Caia’s expression, the canoness elegantly smoothed her own. She said, without apology, ‘Rhene deserves your respect, Sister. There are few, even within our own Order, who have seen the wars, and the deaths, and the horrors, witnessed by Sister Rhene. She may bear no armour, but she is fully combat-trained – and her bolter has slain many a slavering foe, even as she has saved the lives of the Sisters in her charge. Trust in her faith, and her knowledge, and her sanguinator.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Caia said nothing further. For any Sister to have reached the age of the grumbling Hospitaller, and still be in the field of combat rather than teaching at the schola… it deserved veneration. And Rhene, Caia was learning, saw a great deal more than she voiced. Briefly, she thought about asking the old Hospitaller if she knew more about Caia’s own situation – what the canoness had planned for her. She considered the option, then, reluctantly, dismissed it. Much as Caia suspected an old friendship between the two women, her inquiry would be improper. Frustrated, she looked back out across the endless rain-spattered water, and continued to pray. Slowly, the hour climbed towards midday. They had covered over two-thirds of the waiting roadway, almost a hundred and fifty miles from their original muster-point… Yet still, nothing had been laid in their path. As the noontide chimes began, and the canoness broadcast the prayer for the Hour, Caia found herself becoming increasingly suspicious. She, and the others in the Immolator, recited their responses, and yet she kept one eye on the auspex, compelled and wary – almost as if Rayos could reach out to corrupt its spirit, and it would feed them false information. But the Hour’s prayers were completed without mishap, and the rain grew heavier still, limiting their visibility to barely five yards in front of the still-moving vehicles. The crumbled parts of the roadway were beginning to flood, now, and the tanks were forced to slow, navigating the puddles carefully, and washing up a great wall of water to either side. After another hour, Caia began to realise that the horizon was changing. Somewhere, out through the rain, she could make out a shadow – a wide and rising blur, like the base of some vast and jagged cone. ‘Witness the citadel,’ the canoness told her. ‘Our target – and our enemy – lie ahead. We must take extreme care, in this poor visibility. If we can see them…’ Caia, reflexively, recited one of the schola’s earliest combat lessons, ‘…then they can also see us.’ ‘Just so.’ Ianthe, her words thoughtful, made no further comment. She began to pray, not the familiar rhythm of the day’s Hours, or the bugled wrath of the Dies Irae, but something darker, low and soft, a rumble like a bared threat. It was the words of the Reflections ex Testamento Eius, one of the Order’s oldest and most sacred texts, and it felt like the sliding strop of a whetstone. Listening to it made the hairs on Caia’s arms stand on end, as if He stood close, right over her, watching her every breath, her every movement. Caia found herself anticipating the coming battle with a shudder that felt like eagerness. She was a warrior born, and she would not have this taken away, not for all the wealth in the world. And certainly not for a long robe, and a set of false and affected manners… Spare me, she prayed. Let me serve You with fist and bolter, as I have always done. They rolled on. The glutinous rain grew heavier still, driving sideways across a rising wind. It lashed at the waters at the edge of the endlessly long road, driving them to froth and anger. It covered the tanks in spray, and occasionally in things less pleasant. The clouds grew thicker, and lower, and soon, the island was lost. But they still knew it lay ahead of them. Waiting, in the gloom. The first tank-tread triggered the detonation. There was no warning; the air filled with force and noise and smoke and the whistle of flying fragments. Startled, Caia bit back a curse. The noise was followed by a heart-stopping silence, and then a huge ferrocrete rumble. A cry of prayer sounded across the vox. There was creaking, metal twisting and groaning; there was the rumble of desperate engines. There was a single, massive splash. A wave of water sloshed back along the roadway. ‘Reverse!’ Ianthe was barking the order even as Caia heard the grind of the vehicle’s gears. It backed up so rapidly that it threw them both against the front of the hatch. The canoness didn’t pause. ‘Nikaya!’ ‘Milady.’ Through the rain, the movement of the Seraphim was clearly visible – five ascending flares of determined flame marking the Sisters as they went forwards to assess the damage. Caia tracked them with her auspex, saw them hover at what must now be the edge of the road. Ianthe called, ‘Mikaela!’ Nothing. ‘Sister Mikaela!’ Still nothing. ‘Sister Damari.’ ‘Canoness.’ The voice that came back was new, and edged with a tight strain of self-control. ‘We’ve lost the lead Immolator, it went over the edge of the road. Most of the road has followed it into the water.’ ‘Understood.’ Her response was bleak, but solid. ‘Sister Nikaya is coming to you – what is your situation?’ ‘We’re hanging by prayer alone, milady. The other two Immolators have ­successfully reversed.’ ‘Good. Hold to your faith, Sister. Do you need to abandon the vehicle?’ An ongoing creaking came back through the smoke, and echoed like a ghost over the open vox-channel. ‘I fear so. We do not have enough traction to pull back.’ ‘Then do so, you may board with Sister Salva. Nikaya, is the roadway passable?’ ‘We are blessed,’ the Seraphim Superior said grimly. ‘Truly, the Emperor is with us – the road is damaged, but has not collapsed completely. We must traverse this bridgehead carefully, and one vehicle at a time.’ Following the erratic whims of Lycheate’s weather, the wind was high and the visibility poor. As if angered by the Sisters’ impertinence, the spray roared and crashed like some furious creature, and the broken roadway groaned with strain. Gyres of garbage swilled about upon its remaining surface – jagged and rusting armaments, lost weapons, pieces of bodies where even the bone had been eaten down to its final porous fragments. But Sister Nikaya had been right; a thin path remained visi­ble. The twin gleaming rails of the servohauler tracks had better support and reinforcement than the rest of the roadway. They had been warped by the detonation, but Caia could see them, their lines leading onwards like a promise. Like a holy light in the darkness, He had shown them the way. The canoness offered a prayer of thanks. In the lash of wind and water, Caia could see Nikaya and her squad, their flaring jump packs buffeted back and forth. They were scanning the solidity of the road and its supports, making sure. Over the vox, Nikaya almost shouted. ‘The going is poor, but in His name, the uprights have held!’ Caia had a brief memory of the rock bridge upon Lautis, of the daemons waiting below. With a shudder, she shut the memory down. Nikaya continued, ‘We will not be stopped! Rayos and her forces await us!’ ‘It will take more than mines and poor weather,’ Ianthe agreed. She seemed to be thinking, assessing the trouble ahead. ‘Sister Caia? Your thoughts?’ ‘I fear I can see little more than you,’ Caia answered carefully. The green light of her auspex flickered in the rain, showing the chemical composition of the water, the heavy humidity of the air. ‘We must cross.’ ‘Luceat nobis, Sister,’ the canoness told her. ‘The dark holds no terrors for those who carry the light.’ ‘I carry no fear,’ Caia told her. ‘You would not be here if you did, Sister.’ The words were blunt enough to make Caia blink, but Ianthe was already giving more commands. ‘Roku, you will disembark from your Repressor and take position within the Immolator of Sister Cerena. Sister Maria,’ – this to Roku’s driver – ‘you will first traverse the bridge with your unladen vehicle. Sisters Mikaela and Damari, you will embark upon the final Immolator. If the unladen vehicle makes the crossing successfully, we will proceed.’ ‘In His name, canoness.’ Sister Mikaela had hauled herself bodily from her sinking tank, and had been heaved ashore by two of the flying Seraphim, hovering precariously in the battering winds. Her driver had not been so blessed, and had drowned with the vehicle. Mikaela sounded vicious, like she wanted the chance to strike back. ‘We will not be intimidated, Sisters, and we will not falter,’ Ianthe said. ‘We will do as He commands.’ And so, the unladen Repressor dared the road. By His grace, the bridge held – He had demanded the fulfilment of their mission, and not even the tech-priest’s carefully calculated ambushes were enough to stop His will. The canoness stood like a pillar of blood and scarlet, her arms folded, her orders absolute. ‘Advance!’ Following the empty vehicle, first one, then two, Immolators crept carefully out along the servohauler tracks. One at a time, they arrived at the far side and stopped, defending the remainder of the company as it traversed the gap. Augusta’s Repressor followed. Caia watched it with her heart in her mouth, praying for her Sisters. She had missed them at her side; she was used to her squad’s familial unity, to Augusta’s authority, to Viola’s heavy bolter, always beside her. To Melia’s friendship, and to Akemi’s knowledge. She did not want to leave them. Out in the raging weather, the rails were grinding as if they would give at any moment. Caia could almost hear the groaning of the already-stressed uprights, threatening to drop their support. Yet the gleam of the parallel lines remained, a clear path through the ordeal, and the canoness stood undaunted, holding them all with the strength of her faith. Her prayers did not falter, and her voice showed nothing but pure and fervent certainty. They would make the far side of this break. Caia continued to pray, watching Augusta’s Repressor as it vanished into the weather. After minutes that felt like hours, the word came back over the vox that she and the squad were safe. Caia breathed her thanks. By the Light! The canoness said, ‘Close the hatch, Sister. We must make this crossing ourselves.’ She did as she was asked, felt the Immolator rumble forwards. As it did so, the canoness’ voice changed, reciting the litany with the strength and warmth of a chapel electro-candle. Caia found herself clinging to her seat, trying not to think about the teetering, twisting-dark road, the creaking supports, the rage of the water. If the tank went over, was it watertight? She should know this, but suddenly, she wasn’t sure. If they did fall, would they be able to open the hatch, as Mikaela had done, and reach the surface? Inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, they advanced along the bridge. The Immolator was blown and buffeted. The wind slammed at its side like the batter of incoming ammunition. It lurched sideways, making Caia’s belly follow it, but she continued to pray. She wondered what would happen if Rayos’ forces attacked… But there was no attack – perhaps even the heretek could not target through this – and they reached the far side in safety. Following it, one at a time, came the Exorcists. And, at last, the great and headless volcano rose blackly before them, almost as if it were waiting.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The waters’ hunger, however, had not been quite sated. As if they demanded some final sacrifice, the very last vehicle – the Exorcist at the rear of the Order – fell as it had almost reached safety. The edge of the road gave way beneath its tracks, the ferrocrete crumbling with a thundering splash. The rails themselves held, two thin lines of steel stretching out over the water, but the roadway between them had given its last. Yards from safety, the vehicle had teetered, rocked backwards, and then splashed to its death. Its commanding Sister had called one final prayer before the density of the water had cut off her vox. Watching through the weapon-ports, hating her own enforced helplessness, Augusta had prayed for the drivers, and for the spirits of the tanks that they had lost. It would be a slow and horrifying end, the polluted sea steadily eating its way inwards, and inwards, but her fallen Sisters would show no fear, even in the face of such an ordeal. Each knew, as she did, that His light and blessing awaited her. What awaited the company was something else entirely. And Augusta held hard to her prayers, as their objective loomed ahead. A very short time later, they reached the shoreline of the citadel. The road and the tracks continued, now supported above a grey and ashen beach. Here, the wind-driven water frothed and hissed, dumping a tidemark of bubbles, dirt and rubbish, but that was not what pulled the Sister Superior’s attention. Through the weapon-port, she could just about see the outskirts of Lycheate’s central citadel: rock and beach both curved slowly upwards and into the dark, harsh side of a huge and headless mountain. And somewhere, in there, there waited the controls for the Emanatus force field. Borne by His blessing and courage, the Order had reached its target. The canoness’ prayer of thanks came over the vox, and was repeated vehemently by the surviving Sisters. ‘Nos gratias ago nomen Eius!’ We give thanks to His name! Repeating the stanzas, one after another, just as she had for so many years, Augusta shifted in her seat to scan the mountainside. Beside her, Mors and Rufus exchanged a glance – this was the place of their redemption, their final stand, and they both knew it. Once they entered the citadel, neither of them would ever see the light again. Augusta wondered if her own squad faced the same fate. The black stone was disturbingly familiar, reminding her of the jungle-planet Lautis. It was porous and severe, glittering with dark stars of scattered obsidian… …and, just like before, it concealed horrors within its depths. One thing, however, was immediately apparent. From the Kyrus’ orbital scans, Augusta knew that the main entranceway waited some half a mile ahead of them, a colossal cave mouth that swallowed the road, and that allowed the servohaulers, and the waiting machines, access to the factorum complex. Looking at their situation, she felt the hairs on her neck prickle with tension. Their route back was shattered, and they could only move ahead. And somewhere, behind that vast and unseen doorway, the heretek’s assembled forces would be waiting. The canoness, however, did not so much as pause. ‘Sister Augusta,’ she said, over the vox. ‘I have a new mission for you. Report.’ Augusta’s briefing was short and to the point. The rain had slackened, thinning to a misty drizzle. And Sister Superior Augusta, accompanied by her squad and by the two ex-Militarum, both doing their best not to shiver with the cold, had followed their new mission orders and disembarked from their Repressor. They were moving on foot, following the dirty ash beach around the long outside of the mountain. The soft surface was shifting and treacherous, hard to walk upon, but they dared not slacken their pace. They did not have time. Behind them, the surviving vehicles were continuing along the road, ready to face whatever the citadel may spit forth at them – and to ensure that Rayos’ attention was fully occupied. Augusta was following the mission brief that had come direct from the prioress herself. And, the Sister Superior was sure, this was what Sister Alcina was here to observe. If Augusta got this wrong, like her blade in the Ironstrider’s foot… What had she told Mors in the chapel? To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. Mors himself had pulled his face veil up over his nose, protecting his skin from the rain. He and Rufus both had been very quiet, their lasrifles never leaving their hands, their gazes always at the weapon-ports of the Repressor. Their deaths awaited them, but they still showed no fear, and they forged on as best they could through the clumps of infuriating sand. Perhaps, Augusta thought, Alcina was here to ensure the ex-soldiers’ deaths. One way or the other… As if Augusta herself could not be entirely trusted. A last breath of rain gusted across the wind, and slowly the clouds began to clear. Guided by the scans of the Kyrus, the squad continued to follow the long curve of the beach. It was desolate and cold, but nothing came out at them, and as the visibility increased, they began to pick up the pace. And then, they found a miracle. Following the base of a heavy spur, their route taking them back down almost to the waterline, they stopped. A distance ahead of them, a great billow of steam blurred the air, a continuous gusting rise of long grey smoke like the exhalations of some vast machine-spirit. And, as they crested the spur, they saw it: a wide red run of lava that came sliding down the mountainside, a flaring river of fire sloughing through the dense black stone. And, where its front edge met the water, it slowly solidified into great static waves of cooling, hissing rock, one piling upon another. Flames licked over the water’s surface – the lingering patches of oil ignited by the heat. The squad paused. Their suits protected them, but the air shimmered with thermal currents. Augusta had never seen such a thing, never even imagined it – this meeting of fire and water. It seemed almost to contain a spirit all of its own. But she dared not pause long. Stepping forwards with her auspex, Rhea said, ‘We cannot pass here, the temperature is too great. To reach the fissure that the Kyrus has identified, we must ascend the slope.’ ‘Mors?’ Augusta asked. ‘How do you fare?’ The ex-corporal had left his face veil in place. He was muttering back down the line at Rufus, ‘Damned air must be eighty per cent sulphur.’ At the Sister Superior’s words, though, he straightened his shoulders and replied, ‘We fare well, though the temperature is high. And we are fortunate that the rain has eased.’ ‘Aye,’ she said. ‘Walk with courage, we will not be in the open for much longer.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ He paused. Then at a nudge from his squadmate, he said, ’Sister, before we enter this place, may I say something?’ Augusta stopped, indicated for the squad to do likewise. ‘Of course. But swiftly.’ ‘I… we… would like you to take this.’ He held out one hand, something folded in his gloved fist. ‘It is true that we’re deserters, Sister, and we deserve only death. But we still hope to redeem ourselves, somewhere within this great citadel.’ He faltered, and Rufus stepped forwards. ‘It’s our insignia, Sister,’ he said. ‘I know we have no right to ask, but if you could take it back to our captain…’ He ran out of words, dropped his gaze, and stepped back. Augusta held out her gauntlet, let Mors drop the insignia into her fist – the winged skull of the Militarum, a star upon its forehead. She looked at it, and then back at the two young men, so weary and resolved. ‘Conduct yourselves with honour,’ she said, ‘and I will do so. Your tale will not go unremembered.’ The squad turned to head upwards, the mountainside treacherous and the going slippery. But here, too, a path had been laid out for them just as it had been over the water – the rocks had formed into a peculiar, regular pattern of hexagonal pillars, just as if He had been here, carving miraculous steps in the stone, and showing them the way. ‘Truly,’ Augusta muttered, ‘we are blessed. Twice now, He has left us a clear path.’ Red boots skidded, but the squad went on. Viola, her heavy bolter slung over her back, cursed as she heaved herself bodily upwards. Mors and Rufus ascended more easily, their kit a lighter load. And, as the squad climbed higher, they began to find holes in the slope – splits and cracks and fissures, places where the pressure of the volcano within had just proven too much, and had broken out through the ancient stone. Following Rhea’s auspex, Augusta paused at the largest of these. ‘From this point,’ she said to her squad, ‘we will know little. We do not bear maps of this location, and the density of the stone will prevent communication with either the Kyrus, or with the canoness.’ She took a moment to look around at them. ‘I am proud of you, Sisters, every one of you. And you, Mors and Rufus both. This is a test of our faith and our resourcefulness, and one we will not fail. The entire Order is depending upon our success.’ The split in the stone was blacker than the mountainside, and wide enough for their armour – but only just. ‘Sister Rhea, Sister Viola. Let us proceed.’ ‘Aye.’ With the auspex and the heavy bolter at their head, they left the brown Lycheate sun behind them. From here, they would be walking blind. But He had shown them the way, and the light they carried was illumination enough. The tunnels were tight, and treacherous. Augusta’s feet slipped on the cold stone. It was irregular and it tripped her constantly – it seemed that she skidded with every fourth step. In places, outcrops snagged at her shoulders or elbows, or on the tip of her chainsword. The claustrophobic sensation was uncomfortable, and the crackling in the vox reminded her, very clearly, of the hard black density of the rock. The faint light of the tunnel mouth soon faded to a line, and then vanished completely. She had a shuddering memory of the Lautis daemon – curse it for still being able to haunt her! This was no place to harbour such thoughts. Their suit-lights flared hope on the rock face, and they moved on. With the vox now quiet, Augusta began to hear the constant drip-drip of water, the noise distant and oddly hollow, and then, from somewhere else, the heavy rattle of something distinctly metallic. Like a gate, or an overhead door. They moved on, the green glint of Rhea’s auspex at their head. The tunnels seemed natural, jagged and angled – they looked as if some great force had struck the stone, sending splintering cracks in every direction. The spaces were narrow and irregular, unsupported by scaffolding, and yet they steadily ate their way downwards, deeper and deeper into the mountain’s heart. Slowly, the passages grew wider… and the air grew steadily hotter. And then, Rhea stopped. ‘We have reached the end of the fissure, Sister. This crack opens out onto a smooth-bore tunnel.’ ‘Anything in motion? Any security?’ ‘Not that I can detect.’ ‘Be sure. Rayos’ attention will be on the tanks on her doorstep, but I do not wish to attract her notice.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Over Viola’s shoulder, Augusta could see the opening that Rhea had found – the rough, ragged split of the tunnel-edge opening out onto smoothly worked stone, and then continuing on its other side. She thought she could see the walls, engraved with the same prayers that they had seen upon the metal of the Lycheate city. She counted the awareness check in her head, Five seconds. Four… Three… She reached zero. Nothing had moved. ‘Very well. We will proceed with caution.’ Still, they found nothing. Out in the corridors, the security scanners lay dormant, and not so much as a servo-skull hummed across their path. Strips of lumens worked erratically, sending flickering data-ghosts along the long-abandoned walkways of the departed Mechanicus’ citadel. ‘These are not mining tunnels,’ Augusta commented. ‘They must be for maintenance, for servitors or helots, perhaps.’ Maintenance or not, the corridors were precise; their angles exact. As the squad moved on, Augusta began to see old pict-screens, vents and data-banks, and cog-marks engraved in the walls. The corroded remains of pipes wove in and out of the stone, and between them lay prayers that she could not decipher. The air grew warmer still. A little further, and each turning began to carry markings, denominations in both binary and machine-code. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta said, over the vox. ‘The numbers are very clear, Sister,’ Akemi responded. ‘This is conservation and maintenance level four-point-zero-six-five, and the tunnels are worked to a routine hexagonal pattern. The progression of numbers does suggest a single central control point. I would guess that it’s an identical layout to that of the factoria themselves, just on a smaller scale.’ She paused, then added, almost amused, ‘We are blessed that the Mechanicus remain so predictable.’ ‘We must offer our thanks, Sister Akemi,’ Augusta said. ‘Can we follow these numbers to the central location?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then you will join Sister Rhea, and we will continue. Viola, pull back.’ It grew hotter. The temperature readout in Augusta’s armour was climbing higher with every turning they made. Behind her, Mors was sweating profusely; he’d dropped the face veil and his dark skin shone in the suit-lights. Soon, the air began to shimmer with the thickness of the heat. Another turning, and another, Akemi counting as they went. A third, and they saw their first lava flow – a thin, sliding trickle that broke through the tunnel wall and oozed down towards the smoothly worked floor, cooling as it descended. It left a swelling growth like a tumour, rippling and bulbous, and slowly, slowly growing. It also obscured the old Mechanicus wall markings. ‘So, these fissures are more recent than the tunnels themselves,’ Augusta commented. ‘It may explain why they are abandoned – and why the Mechanicus have been so reluctant to return to this world.’ ‘There is no current evidence of seismic or volcanic activity,’ Rhea answered, from the front. ‘These fissures are old, and they read as stable. We are secure. Certainly for the moment.’ They continued, passing more and more of the tiny, fissured flows, some of them beginning to run together, others steadily eating through the floor. None of them were large – the Sisters could step across every one – but the temperature was still climbing. Mors and Rufus were beginning to struggle with the relentlessness of the heat. Unspeaking, Augusta passed Mors back her water bottle. And then Rhea told them to halt. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘There is a large space ahead of us. We have found the central factorum.’ The door was vast, and utterly impassable. It was a rusted sheet of steel in the side of the mountain. It cut dead across the roadway, and across the gleaming servohauler tracks. A march of sagging pillars flanked its approach, all linked by aged steel chains; empty flame-bowls stood to either side. Turret emplacements had been long bereft of their weapons, and some huge ferrocrete statue had crumbled until only the last few feet remained. Upon the door itself, the colossal cog-and-skull was leeringly familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Caia said, without surprise. Above the gate’s silent threat, the black wall of the volcano rose both faceless and headless, and the brown clouds seemed to rest upon its top. Tiny red flares shifted across its surface as Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim rose aloft to assess its defences. ‘The Emanatus force field covers only the very top of the volcano,’ Nikaya said. ‘There are multiple defence ports, but they’re sealed.’ ‘Hold fast, my Sisters.’ The canoness’ tone was cautious, but contained no fear. Caia knew that they would be facing overwhelming numbers, as well as the point-defences of the citadel itself, but these things were of no consequence. Their task was to draw the fire of the enemy, while Augusta and her squad penetrated the depths of the mountain. She prayed for them, for her fallen Sisters, for herself. Standing in the back of the Immolator, looking up at that huge and grinning skull, Caia wondered if Rayos had calculated every probability of their advance, of their every movement and choice. Wondered if the heretek had drawn them here, knowing that they would be defeated– The auspex blipped movement. Not much, barely a flicker – a single contact. It moved as if a sergeant walked along his ranks of troops, inspecting and commanding them, as if– As if they were expected. She was about to speak – some sort of warning – but the great door rattled, grumbled, and began to rise. The rasping noise of rust was teeth-gratingly painful. Sister Caia stared forwards, and into the gaping dark. ‘How many?’ Augusta asked. In Rhea’s hand, the glowing green screen of the auspex was still. ‘None.’ They had come to a balcony, a high viewpoint above an echoingly empty space – Vastum Factorum-01, and Rayos’ muster point. And this one did not follow the layout of its fellows. There were no hoppers here, no facilities for construction or creation. This was surely just a storage facility, yet it seemed endless, stretching away from them, further than they could see. It was floored with smooth black stone – the great basalt plug of the volcano. And within that stone were laid long parallel lines of gleaming steel, one after another after another, all of them vanishing into its cavernous limits. An identical series of upright supports, looming like gibbets in the half-light, rose from each one – lines and lines and lines of static mini-shrines, each one a prayer point where the stored machine-spirit could find its rest. And every one of them stood empty. ‘The canoness’ plan has been successful.’ Augusta’s tone was quiet, and swallowed by the hugeness of the room. ‘The heretek’s force is distracted.’ Alcina answered, her voice grim, ‘Our Sisters will be paying for every moment we delay.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. ‘We must locate the central control node. Sister Rhea, does anything remain in this location?’ Rhea held her auspex, moving it slowly in an arc. ‘Nothing, Sister.’ ‘Then we will proceed with our mission brief. We will follow the numerals to the central location, and there, we will disable the force field. And may the Emperor stand with our Sisters as they face Rayos’ army.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT Somewhere in the darkness there moved weapons, and metal, and flesh. Sister Caia had seen the Lycheate machines before – the Breacher that had assaulted them upon their arrival, the kastelans that had answered to Rayos, and to Scafidis Zale. She had never seen anything like this. These things were horror-spawned, from the corrupt mind of the heretek. They were wrong, somehow – their weapons lopsided or crudely built, their bodies twisted, their feet or tracks dragging sparks that flashed like the meetings of wires. She knew little about machine-spirits, but her heart understood: these were abominations. The red lines of tanks had formed into an inverse arc, grouped before the now-open doorway. At the centre, now, the canoness stood in her Immolator with one hand aloft, holding back her troops’ desire to fire, and waiting for the enemy to fully reveal itself, sliding and grinding like corruption from the dark. More sounds came from above them – the defence ports were sliding open. But Nikaya and the Seraphim were waiting, their jump packs holding them tight to the rock face and out of range of fire. From the assembled Sisters, the unified words of the litany were like the threatening rumble of an avalanche – as if, once these machines entered the doorway itself, the might of the God-Emperor would bring the entire side of the mountain down upon them… But Rayos was not that foolish. Her force stopped, pausing just inside the cave’s huge mouth. It waited in the semi-dark, ragged and misshapen, listing and slumping, just as if the Ruinous Powers themselves had taken a hand in its formation. And a voice, so familiar to Sister Caia, echoed from the stone, from the metal, from the twitching, jerking skulls of the Breachers and Destroyers… ‘Sisters,’ Rayos’ voice said. It was logic-cold, yet it somehow seemed to hiss with that same thin, cold humour that Caia remembered from their previous meeting. ‘You have erred. There is an eighty-nine-point-eight per cent chance that you will lose this confrontation. You, with your faith, and your weak and human flesh.’ The canoness did not respond, except with the continuing thud and threat of the litany, booming like military drums. It echoed back from the mountainside. Caia’s hand tightened on her bolter, though it was her auspex that she watched. She said, quietly, ‘There are more of them, waiting out of our line of sight.’ Ianthe gave a single, grave nod. ‘Estimation of total numbers, Sister Caia.’ Caia replied, ‘Maybe two hundred and fifty individual units.’ ‘Their greatest concentration?’ ‘At the very rear.’ ‘Very well. Then let us finish this.’ Her shout came over the vox-coder, blasted through the pipes that still stood upon the top of her Immolator. ‘Immolators, Seraphim! Fire!’ And the Sisters’ wrath was loosed upon the enemy. Deep in the mountain tunnels, that first rumble of gunfire echoed like the boom of some distant heartbeat. Augusta felt Alcina, behind her, tense; heard Rhea catch her breath. Whatever happened down here, their Sisters were fighting and dying to give them time to achieve their goal. And they dared not falter. ‘We must move,’ she said, a thrum of urgency to her tone. ‘This mission will not permit us to dawdle.’ Beside her, Mors nodded. His nose and cheeks had taken scattered burn damage from the acid drizzle, but he’d made no complaint, and they had not stopped. Led only by Rhea’s scan and Akemi’s counting, they began to move more swiftly. The distant thunder of weapons continued, and the crackling of the empty vox told the Sister Superior, more clearly than any shout of urgency, that they could not afford to delay. She reviewed her new mission orders: once they had eliminated the force field, they were to retreat. The Kyrus would be beginning her countdown the moment she had a clear line of fire. The citadel was large enough that the massed tanks of the Order would survive… But Augusta’s squad were on foot. Offer your lives to the Emperor. She silenced the flicker of doubt with a flare of annoyance. Neither Mors nor Rufus had flinched, had shown the slightest fear. And she was Sororitas – if she were to perish in the line of her duty, then it would be with courage. Despite Istrix’s death, she would face the Golden Throne knowing she had died with her honour intact. If it were possible, however, she would uphold her responsibilities. Her squad were blameless, following her orders, and she would allow her Sisters to retreat, survive… Spare them Your wrath, she prayed. They have done nothing wrong. She would face her fate alone. Alone, or with these two young soldiers that had come so far. Akemi paused by another marker, and told them to turn left. They seemed to be moving in an arc, heading inwards, and still down. It was a long haul, but the corridors were steadily widening and the Sisters were beginning to watch for servitors, for skitarii, or for wherever Rayos may have left here to guard her main force. Yet still, there was nothing. If there were foot-troops, then perhaps they, too, had been mustered outside to face the canoness. And Ianthe would show them no mercy. Then Sister Rhea said, ‘Wait.’ In the silence of the corridor, they paused. The tunnels were still. Brass pipes ran like veins along their ceilings; wires clung to the stone, now bereft of information or power. The pict-screens flickered with vestiges of life, their half-formed data-ghosts striving to manifest. They sent odd, eerie lighting down the empty stone. Mors said, his deep voice quiet, ‘It’s still getting warmer–’ ‘The temperature has significantly risen,’ Sister Rhea confirmed, cutting him off. ‘I suspect there will be another lava flow ahead – a large one.’ ‘We are very close now,’ Akemi said. ‘The central forge temple lies ahead.’ In the distance, the boom and rattle of gunfire continued. ‘Do not pause,’ Sister Alcina said sternly. ‘Our Sisters fight for our time, and we must achieve our target.’ Alcina’s repetition was unnecessary, but Augusta said nothing. Her new second was not wrong, and the Sister Superior was beginning to suspect that there might be another reason why there were no defences down there. Rayos had no need of them. ‘Head right, then left, then right again,’ Akemi said. ‘Sister Rhea,’ Augusta commented. ‘You are familiar with the device that we seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Rhea said. ‘I do not possess Sister Akemi’s literacy, but I have seen such things before, on Mete, and the Mechanicus remain obsessively consistent. I will be able to shut down the force field.’ ‘We will proceed,’ Augusta said. ‘Walk swiftly, but with caution.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved onwards. Augusta could not read the machine dialect that was now flickering on the half-dead pict-screens, but she could see that the strings of binary were becoming shorter. Akemi was surely right – they were closing in on the central facility. Mors had pulled his face veil back up over his nose – the air was becoming more sulphurous. And Augusta was beginning to see it: the light was changing. Amid the flickers of the pict-screens, there was a deeper, steadier illumination, a soft red glow that was gradually growing stronger. The Sisters had seen this glow before. The ruddy colour of bare lava, somewhere ahead of them. Weapons roared alongside the vocal thunder of unified prayer. The air was thick with smoke and debris, with the flow and spark of living data, with the groaning and grinding of the strange, lopsided machines. Surrounded by the rage of battle, the Sisters’ tanks held their position. Their stationary formation was intended to pull Rayos’ forces out of the mountain, and then bring the stone down upon them, but Rayos was too wily, and her lines did not advance. Instead, her front rank opened fire. Caia, still standing behind the canoness in the lead Immolator, wondered why she did not deign to duck back inside the vehicle – but the moment Ianthe raised her pistol and opened fire herself, Caia understood. A streak of yellow light hit the end Breacher and its chest simply exploded, spattering its tracked base with gore. In the remaining mess, its exposed cogs spun for a startled second, and then were still. Caia opened her bolter to a full suppression, her rounds chewing holes in the next Breacher along. Its twisted human face showed no pain, no emotion, nothing – but it raised its shoulder and the weapon attached, and Caia knew that it would shoot straight at them. Ianthe sang the litany like a call of trumpets, and dared it to even consider the action. To either side of them, the surviving two Immolators were shooting with their heavy bolters, the weapons turning in suppression arcs. The two Repressors had remained still, waiting for the moment that the Order would roll forwards and into the cave mouth, but, for now, Ianthe was still holding them where they were. At the rear, the Exorcists were loaded and ready, but Rayos had been too clever. Calculating exactly the amount to raise the door, the arcing missiles did not have the necessary clearance, and their bolters could not shoot past the vehicles in the front. Above her, Caia was aware of the Seraphim, flitting across the rock face. With her focus on the enemy, she caught them from the corners of her vision, each one holding her place below a shielded gun port, then jumping upwards to shoot clean through the slit and eliminate the servitor, or gunner, that had been about to fire. Four of the Seraphim defeated their static targets with almost perfect flying manoeuvres; the fifth was less blessed. She missed, and the autocannon swivelled, catching her full in the chest. She spasmed backwards, then fell, plummeting with a streak of flame behind her. When she hit the ground, she crumpled like a broken thing. She did not move again. For a split second, Caia blinked at the broken corpse, appalled at how suddenly a Sister could perish, torn from the air and the battle with the brief blast of a weapon… But she stood before the Throne, her service completed. Blessed be her memory. Despite the loss, however, the Order was doing damage – the machines in the front were juddering under the heavy combined fire of the two Immolators and under the huge impacts of the canoness’ shooting. It was only as the first rank tumbled, however, that Caia realised they’d been bolter-fodder. And that the main attack was still to come. ‘Sisters,’ Akemi said. ‘We have reached corridor zero-zero-two, and the final junction. The side of the forge temple lies directly ahead.’ ‘Hold.’ Augusta’s command brought both Akemi and Rhea to a stop. Rhea, reflexively, responded, ‘Nothing moving, Sister, but the temperature is extreme.’ The squad had paused just short of the tunnel’s smooth and open mouth. Somewhere ahead of them, red light shone up from below, bathing the rock ceiling in a rich, ruddy sheen. Beside the Sister Superior, Mors was sagging, sheeted in sweat. His clothing was stained with it, but he still made no word of complaint. Rhea added, her voice soft in the vox, ‘Sisters, we have reached our goal.’ Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… A prayer in her heart, Augusta moved forwards to see for herself. And stopped. Their tunnel opened out at the lip of a massive rift. No, not a rift, a chasm. A great, jagged moat that cracked clean down through the stone – an abyss from which the lava-light rose like fire, before losing itself in the vast darkness overhead. But that wasn’t all. By the Light! The Sister Superior held back the exclamation – she would show no fear, no doubt. But, out there ahead of her, on the far side of the rift, there rose a huge and mighty wall, black as basalt, and carved into vast square oriels and heavy, angled buttresses. It was clearly the wall of some immense cathedral, and yet it was layered with wheeled cogs, with folded cranes, with openings like vents and waste-chutes, and with colossal pipes, layered one upon another like a writhing mass of creeper. It stretched up and up, to the heights of the unseen roof, and down and down, far into the firepit below. The pipes’ metal glowed red with the heat, but by some Mechanicus wonder that she could not begin to comprehend, it had neither melted nor faltered – and it lit the great building with a glow like pure hellfire. ‘Forge temple,’ she said, not hiding the awe in her tone. ‘In His name, I could never have imagined one so huge. Truly, this is a place of the Omnissiah, now fallen to the heretek’s corruption.’ Viola muttered a savage expletive, and Alcina silenced her with a snap. Akemi was still looking at the last set of numbers, consulting the dataslate she held in her hand. Mors had sagged against the wall, and was struggling to breathe. ‘Can we pass here?’ Alcina asked, her tone flat and unimpressed. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta ignored her second, and asked the obvious question. ‘Is there another route to the temple, or is this our only access?’ Akemi started to answer, but Alcina cut across her. ‘We must move swiftly. Our Sisters are dying while we dally.’ ‘And it will avail them nothing if we also perish,’ Augusta told her shortly. ‘We have been tasked with a mission, and the success of that mission is our only purpose. Akemi?’ Akemi said, ‘There is a final junction, to corridor zero-zero-one, but it is very long. And I am not certain of its success.’ Alcina restated, ‘Sister Superior, we do not have the time for this. We must pass here.’ ‘That decision is mine to take, Sister.’ Augusta’s tone was severe. ‘While offering our lives to the Golden Throne is the greatest honour a Sister may hope for, we are here to complete a mission.’ Alcina stepped forwards, her shoulders seeming to fill the tunnel. ‘It is my…’ she stopped herself, ‘…advice that we should seek passage at this point.’ Augusta did not permit herself the acid retort – such things were childish, left behind in the schola’s earliest years. But this was outright insubordination. She said, her tone flat, ‘You will do as you are commanded, Sister.’ Alcina loomed, her stance angry, but she did not push the point. Over a tight-beam channel on the vox, Melia’s voice said, ‘She is watching us. Waiting to see if we stumble.’ Augusta answered her, ‘I am aware of this. The witch touched us all too closely, and our loyalty is in question. Such doubt would insult both our honour and service, were it not based in reason. The success of this mission is imperative.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia said nothing more. At the front of the company, Rhea said, ‘Sisters, there is a way across the rift.’ Augusta turned back to the tunnel mouth. Beside her, leaning forwards over the gap, Viola muttered an epithet even more unsuitable than the first. ‘Enough,’ Augusta told her. A distance to their right, hung above the red glow like some narrow and suspended shadow, there was a walkway, the same black stone as the wall. Heavy chains, like a drawbridge, held it, but even from here they could see that the chains were sorely corroded. The fire lit its underside like pure, glowing hunger. ‘Sister Akemi,’ Augusta said, ‘can you give me a solid reason to not accept this alternative?’ ‘I fear not, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. Her voice carried the faintest twinge – guilt or regret – but she made no apology, and she faced the chasm without fear. Augusta paused, aware of the eyes of the others, awaiting her decision. She had a very clear memory of the demented inquisitor, leading the squad into ambushes, traps, and probable death. Propelled by her insane belief, Istrix had sacrificed not only her faith, but her very reason… ‘Very well,’ Augusta said. ‘Once again, He has shown us the way. Three times, we have paused, and three times, we have been blessed with His guidance. Let us continue.’ Rhea nodded, and Viola stepped back, hissing through her teeth. Akemi reattached the dataslate to her hip, and Augusta was aware of Mors and Rufus, shoulder to shoulder, and all but leaning on each other for strength. With their lighter gear, they had a better chance of reaching the far side than did the Sisters, however the heat and the fumes were taking a heavy toll upon them both. Rufus caught her looking, and offered her the sign of the aquila. ‘We will walk, Sister. We have no fear.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. It was only as she offered the prayer for their courage and safety that she became aware of something else… At some point, while they’d been discussing how to proceed, the sound of gunfire had stopped.",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Augusta did not see Rufus fall. In the continuous shimmer of the rising heat, the Sister Superior had done her best to watch both the ex-soldiers, their shoulders shaking now, their breathing straining with sulphur and exhaustion. But she could not be everywhere, and the shout from Melia made her turn. It was already too late. The young medicae made no sound; he did not have time. He was a tiny tumbling silhouette, black against the firelight below. And then he was a flash. And then he was gone. Augusta saw Mors stumble as the last member of his squad died before his eyes. ‘Decidit gloria.’ She answered his shock, his grief, with a gauntleted hand under his elbow, holding him up, with the words she’d learned when she’d seen for the first time a fellow Sister offer her life. Decidit gloria… Mors was shaking, she could feel it, but he took his own weight, picked the words up and repeated them, calm above the slavering heat. Fall with honour. Alcina gave a low impatient growl. ‘We must not pause here.’ A flare of ire rose in Augusta’s heart, just like the flare of fire they’d seen from below – they were warriors all, fighting servants of the God-Emperor, and they were stronger together. There was always a moment to find or pool their courage. Yet Alcina was right, they could not linger here. Augusta ended her prayer, glanced at Mors, and gave the order to go onwards. And so, with Rhea and Viola still at their head, they reached the end of the drawbridge, and the great, black wall that was Vastum’s central forge temple. ‘In times of fear,’ Augusta’s schola tutor had once told her, ‘you may rely upon two things. What are they? Your armour and your weapons? Yes? Anyone else have an answer? Your faith, Sisters, and your training.’ The old woman had been a warrior herself, and her lesson had stayed in Augusta’s heart – reflex was a powerful motivator. And now, as they moved carefully, skirmish formation, through a black stone archway and down through hollow corridors, she understood the wisdom of those words. Their faith was unquestioned, and it was manifest in every single one of these well-known actions, in the smooth operations of her assembled Sisters. Rhea and Viola worked well together – they had slotted into their roles as Sisters should. But Alcina… Augusta was aware of her second’s eyes, always upon her back. They made her itch. And that itch shamed her, despite its persistence – were they not all Sisters, in the service of the same light? They went onwards. Very soon, the corridor turned through an angle, the exact same sixty degrees as the outer tunnels – it seemed the temple, too, was crafted to hexagonal design. There were no numbers here, however, and Rhea and Akemi seemed to be moving on pure instinct, following the pipes and the stonework, as they headed for the building’s heart. As they moved on inwards, they began to encounter cloisters, though nothing like Augusta had known before. Great arcs of conduits surrounded hexagonal spaces, each one with a rusting metal shrine at the centre, and its cog-and-skull engraved in the underlying stone. In other places, short steps led them upwards, and great steel portcullises were long rusted into place. They hung above the Sisters’ heads like teeth, ready to descend. And then, at last, they came to the side door and the transept, and the heart of Vastum’s might and power. The place where that central control node would be waiting for them. Rifles, cannons, blasters. The bright-white glow of phosphor and the blossoming red detonations of high-calibre rounds. Half-hidden by the shadows of the doorway, the second rank of Rayos’ force laid down their fire. Caia’s auspex was telling her – though the canoness already knew – that they would not advance. But Ianthe was calling orders, pulling the Exorcists up, extended file, alongside the Immolators, and commanding the whole single rank to roll forwards, protecting the troop-bearers behind the advancing front. This was not a battle for infantry. Not yet. It was, however, a battle for the Seraphim. Down to four, the airborne Sisters swooped in under the edge of the door, and flew a straight strafing run all along the stationary line, each ­hammering down rounds from her twin bolters as she passed swiftly overhead. The line of machines did not react. It was not human, it could not flinch or be distracted – but the damage was being done. The Breachers and Destroyers, out at the flanks, were more vulnerable. Shots to their human heads took a severe toll, and already their fire was lessening. As the Seraphim reached the far end of the line, four of the waiting machines had been destroyed. And the red tanks rolled in, relentless, trumpets blaring from the vox-coder, towards the standing line of their foes. Any conscious enemy would surely have baulked, but the machines did not move. The canoness took cover, then shot a standing kastelan clean to the face, and watched it topple sideways, taking its nearest neighbour down with it. Blazing with righteousness, she targeted a second, and her streak of yellow fire struck its shoulder. It did not fall, but its cannon misfired and exploded, and sent a flash of light outwards through the black stone. It let Caia see one thing very clearly – the height of the roof. And it seemed Ianthe had seen it also. The canoness’ voice snapped the order, ‘Exorcists! Missiles, on my word!’ The greatest concentration of numbers was at the very back. Caia didn’t know if Rayos was here with her troops, or simply picking up the projected data as they fought, but wherever she was, she must surely be defended. Perhaps she was still human enough to wish to see this for herself. But the line of machines was still shooting, and the incoming barrage was taking a toll. Their own Immolator crunched and buckled at the impacts of heavy arc rifles and torsion cannons. One lopsided Kataphron was armed with a colossal plasma weapon – Caia had not seen its like before, but the glow of its power and the spit of its fire were tremendous. It struck one of the advancing Exorcists clean to the nose and the vehicle simply detonated, the blast immense in the enclosed space. Above the blast, one of the Seraphim was caught in the updraft, but she rode the current with extreme skill, came back down swooping at the Breacher and spattered its head across its metal shoulders. Still, the tanks rolled on. Still, the line facing them neither moved nor recoiled. Overhead, the arcs of the two surviving Exorcists’ missiles seemed like shooting stars in the darkness. And where they struck, the damage was immediate. Explosions rocked the cavern; Caia’s lenses flicked in their antidazzle as the confusion of noise and pressure almost knocked her back. The air was full of blood and smoke and oil and death. Still, the tanks did not stop. And as they reached full speed, the canoness shouted, ‘All drivers! Ram!’ Their own Immolator struck the legs of the kastelan before it. It was slow, like some lumbering giant; its great fist went to grab and crush them, but the strike missed as they rolled onwards. As it tried to balance and turn, the blast of Ianthe’s plasma pistol hit it in the side and it twisted into a complete fall, crushing the Breacher beside it to metal and pulp. In the vox, Caia could hear Sister Nikaya, the power of her hymn carrying her and the Seraphim forwards on another swoop-and-kill. They were sticking to the far flanks, out of the line of fire of the incoming vehicles. But another kastelan was ready for them. Sharper than its fellow, it timed Nikaya’s strafe and it met her, head-on, with one massive fist. Steel met steel; the jump pack coughed and guttered. At the noise, Ianthe’s voice caught on a furious crescendo. For a split second, nothing seemed to happen, Nikaya seemed to almost hang in the air… and then her jump pack flickered and went out completely, and she fell, down and down, and into the darkness. In the turmoil, Caia could not see where she’d landed, and the auspex was too confused to pick one contact out of the mess. The canoness was shouting, now, livid and furious, snapping orders of war and retribution. Rhene was moving, but Ianthe took a moment to bark, ‘No! Stay where you are! You are necessary and I cannot lose you!’ To Caia’s either side, the other two Immolators were still rumbling on, their heavy tracks carrying them insistently forward, and aiming their full rate of fire at the standing machines. They could hardly miss, and the machines were taking significant damage, but they were close, now, almost upon them. One of the Breachers coughed flame, but the fire fell back from the Immolator’s armour. The other one lowered its heavy cannon to shoot point-blank. The impact crunched the Immolator to a dead stop. Still shooting, straining to see, Caia thought that something had come loose from the front of the vehicle and was jammed in its tracks. The cannon was already powering up to shoot again, but the Breacher jerked and faltered under a hail of incoming rounds. ‘Their flesh is their weakness!’ Belatedly, Caia realised that the canoness had been giving commands for the last few moments. ‘Strike them in the head if you can!’ Fervently, Caia lifted her voice and continued to shoot, her smaller bolter seeming to do little damage. By contrast, the canoness’ pistol was ferocious, every hit a kill, every kill a celebration, every celebration a prayer. The second line of machines was almost down, and the Order was still moving, still pressing forwards. But Rayos, it seemed, had not finished with them yet. The forge temple was silent, and ruddy with the sullen glow of lava-light. It was a great vaulted hollow, cracked to the core, isolated by the yawning depths of its moat, and by the huge, hollow height of the mountain that encased it… and it carried an odd sense of unease that was making the Sister Superior sweat. ‘Rhea,’ Augusta said, her tone showing nothing of her tension. ‘Do you know what you seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Rhea sounded edgy, but she showed no hesitation. ‘We must find the focus of this building’s lost faith.’ ‘We will stay together,’ Augusta said. ‘I do not trust this place enough to split our strength. Viola, stay with Rhea. Akemi, Mors, with me. Alcina, Melia, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ The formation closed tight, weapons bristling in every direction. At Rhea’s indication, they headed through the transept for the wide space visible ahead. Still, they had seen no servitors, no guards, not so much as a cogitator or a floating servo-skull… But the sweat that slid down Augusta’s spine left a shudder as it passed. Unlike the headless corpse of the great cathedral upon Lautis, this space did not feel empty. It felt full, full of heat, full of potential and hostility, full of data, full of writhing streams of information that still moved across the air– It felt like it was watching them. ‘There.’ Rhea’s indication was unnecessary, they could all see the wide stone steps that led up to the central altar. It was not a stone plinth, a place of electro-candles and effigies; it looked more like a construction, a great layering of furnaces and walkways and steel steps, a tech-priest-made machine-spirit that should have been the Omnissiah’s strength on this, His distant world… But it lay dead, its furnaces cold, its walkways sagging. Like Lycheate itself. And then, a piece of it moved. The third rank of Rayos’ defences. Still no sign of the heretek herself, just her massed machines, line after line of them, ranks of foes that the Sisters must cut their way through. Yet these, Caia thought, looked different. They were clean-lined, and better made. They stood straight, their weapons strong. They lacked the writhing of wires, the exposed joints, the poorly made tracks, and the old welds across their steel bodies. Almost instinctively, Caia understood that the previous two ranks had been built in haste – that, for the weeks since the Sisters’ arrival, Rayos had been concentrating on massing her force. These machines had been made correctly, with more care, and time. As if they had been made by something– ‘These are older,’ the canoness said, finishing Caia’s thought. ‘Rayos could not have built–’ They did not have time to discuss the fact. The air was alive, and the massed machines were opening fire. Rayos. Augusta recognised the heretek from their previous mission – small, for a tech-priest, malign and misshapen. Her half-human face bore a slick of recent burn scars and one blue eye, and she wore a familiar black-shimmer cloak. She moved to the head of the steps as if she could deny the Sisters access to anything she chose. ‘Sister Superior,’ she said. Her voice, too, was recognisable, that same chill, analytical scorn. When Rayos spoke in human words, it felt like the heretek was lowering herself to the level of inferior beings. In response, Viola aimed the heavy bolter, the weapon the best answer she could give. Melia’s flamer gouted a belch of fire, as if it were eager for a second try. ‘Heretek,’ Augusta answered. The tech-priest shifted, clicking. ‘You have come far, Sisters. Two-hundred-point-one-four miles. We have watched you. We have calculated your every move. Your every response has been within expected parameters. And you have arrived precisely on schedule.’ Augusta was aware of Sister Rhea, auspex in hand, searching for the mechanism. She saw Rayos note the motion; saw the minute tilt of her head, its angle exact. It looked almost like amusement. ‘Your questing will avail you nothing,’ Rayos said. ‘You will perish here, all of you. And your weapons and equipment will be valuable.’ Augusta closed her hand on her chainsword. She wanted this over, wanted to slay this accursed heretek, but she dare not make a mistake. Alcina’s eyes were on her, and Rayos… The fallen tech-priest knew how to calculate the odds. She must know that she could not take on all six Sisters by herself. And she’d said, ‘we’. The Sister Superior came forwards, right to the bottom of the steps. She was looking for the concealed force, the gun emplacements, the backup or reinforcements that were giving Rayos this mathematical confidence. She said, pushing, ‘We are cutting your army to pieces.’ ‘Not my army, Sister,’ Rayos said. Again, that tilt of almost amusement. ‘My vanguard.’ What? Augusta felt Alcina tense; the clatter of her armour was audible. Rayos said, ‘You have erred. Your assault is destroyed. There is a ninety-four-point-eight per cent chance that your canoness will perish.’ ‘By the Light!’ Alcina’s voice. Her boots sounded on the stone. She was moving, but Augusta did not turn. The Sister Superior was fixed on Rayos at the top of the steps, her black cloak glistening like a living thing. ‘Your odds are nothing, heretek,’ Augusta said. ‘We will bring His light back to the darkness. Viola!’ The younger Sister shifted, and Augusta could feel her eagerness to fire – a crackle of faith and fury that defied the pure logic of the corrupted temple. One directed burst from the thrice-blessed heavy bolter would splatter Rayos’ remains across the forge-works behind her. Then something said, ‘Sororitas.’ The Order’s tanks were losing. Drawn forwards by the machines ahead, they had allowed a flanking manoeuvre to close in about them. Their line was enveloped at both ends, and they did not have the weapons to face a front that long. Still standing, still broadcasting righteousness and ferocity, the canoness was a one-woman army, the bright blasts of her plasma pistol taking down machine after machine. Caia stayed behind her, her smaller bolter seeming to do no damage, but she kept firing nonetheless. Another Immolator lost, another detonation that made after-images spark across the Sisters’ vision. And there were foot-troops, now, skitarii and servitors, faster than the lumbering machines and moving in close. But the Repressors, too, were firing – the Sisters inside were opening up through the weapon-ports even as the storm bolters on the vehicles’ tops moved to keep the skitarii at bay. As the foot-troops closed about the lead Immolator, the canoness was over the edge of the hatch and right in the middle of them, her chainsword now in her other hand and whipping through two of them at a time. She sent them toppling and reeling, sparking as they fell. She sang as she cut them to pieces, her voice incensed with fury. In her ten years of service, Caia had never seen anything fight like Elvorix Ianthe. She shot at them herself, those that were close enough – the battle was rapidly becoming a blur. The vehicles were still driving slowly forwards, clean over the top of anything foolish enough to get under their tracks, but the sheer weight of numbers was proving too much. Aloft, three Seraphim were changing tactics and picking careful targets – swooping in to alpha-strike a single machine and bring it down, and then moving onto the next. Steadily, they stopped one end of the line. But it was not enough. The canoness, in the vox: ‘Where are your squad, Sister Caia? They should have reached the temple!’ ‘I do not know!’ Caia had no answer, and could only pray. ‘I do not know!’ ‘Sororitas.’ The voice was rusted with age, strained with disuse. It made a shock of pure cold go down Augusta’s spine. Almost on top of them, something was moving. The Sister Superior turned, bringing blade and bolter to cover the motion. And stopped. By the Throne! The thing was big – huge – and it loomed like part of the shadows. As it shifted, it creaked and groaned as if it were somehow unused to motion. The temple’s sense of data, unseen in the air, coalesced about it like some invisible aura. Viola glanced, but she kept her heavy bolter on Rayos, ready to fire. ‘Hold your fire.’ Augusta’s command was swift. The new figure was strange, oddly hunched. It moved sideways, one step at a time, almost as if it were in pain. And it seemed wrong, somehow, twisted with age and rust. ‘Sororitas,’ it said, again. The word was a machine-whisper, a flicker through the empty temple. It was a hiss like a bellows, like the escaping of steam. It sounded as if it were decaying from the inside. Augusta stared. Watching it, she had a leap of understanding, a sudden sensation of everything making sense – as if the Emperor Himself had revealed to her the answer… She said, ‘Vius.’ The figure stopped. It said, its voice scraping, ‘Designation Incaladion Tech-priest Dominus 01-Vius.’ It wheezed like metal laughter, like fingernails rasping down a new set of armour. ‘Vastum belongs to me.’ ‘Vius.’ The echo was Akemi. ‘The inquisitor told us. After the Mechanicus abandoned Vastum, it was Vius who first landed–’ ‘That would make him two centuries old,’ Viola answered her sceptically. ‘Data – uploaded and preserved,’ Vius said. ‘Metal – worked and preserved. Only flesh falters. Incaladion awaits my return.’ ‘You want to go home,’ Augusta said. ‘That’s why everything still bears the Incaladion mark.’ Again, that rusted wheeze that might have been laughter. Unlike Rayos, Augusta could see no flesh upon this figure, nothing that remained of his once-human body. She wondered how he retained his emotions… such as they were. Humour… …and vengeance. ‘You will not leave here,’ she told him. Vius hissed. ‘You err, Sister Superior. Your every move has already been calculated. You are here to shut down the Emanatus field.’ ‘And what’s to stop us?’ Viola asked him, her tone harsh. ‘You?’ There was a long, full pause. In the far distance, the sound of gunfire had started up again. Vius twitched his metal skull to one side, a mocking parody of listening, and came further forwards, his huge frame looming over them. An odd heat radiated from his cloaked body. This close, he was genuinely daunting, his hunched figure far bigger than the Sister Superior, bigger even than Alcina, armour and all. And when he shrugged his multiple shoulders, letting his black cloak puddle to the ground, his vast array of limbs and weapons made him look like some colossal stalk-eyed insect, poised and ready to strike. The air of the temple seemed to move around him, ready to do his bidding. ‘Flesh is weak,’ he said. ‘You cannot reach the control panel. You will not leave here.’ He lifted one arm, and a surge of gunnery skulls rose with the motion, surrounding the Sisters with their broad and toothy grins. Rayos still stood at the top of the steps, and her cloak, too, had puddled to the floor. You cannot reach the control panel. You will not leave here. The heretek dominus would tear them all to screaming pieces.",

      "title": "Chapter 45",
      "content": "CHAPTER TEN There were no pews, nothing that could offer the squad good cover. And the heretek dominus knew it. His limbs were widely deployed with a horrific selection of weaponry – a vintage stubber, a steel axe, other things that Augusta did not recognise. She was already turning away, barking orders, telling her Sisters to spread out and flank him– A bright ball of energy struck her full in the chest and stuck there, like some guiding light. And every skull in the temple opened fire, aiming at the illuminated spot. Her armour denting under the onslaught, Augusta was battered backwards, her feet skidding on the stone. She raised her bolter. But Viola had just been waiting for the chance. Switching targets, and with a prayer like a paean, she hit the heretek dominus with the full rate of fire of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter. It did nothing. Static crackled about his frame, a flashing wash of brilliance that simply stopped the rounds in mid-air. They hit, detonated, surrounded him in a corona of fire… But they did not touch his metal body. Swearing, she tried again. Seeing the force field, however, Augusta was already changing her orders. She was unhurt, but her armour was dented hard enough to restrict her breathing; she checked for cracks in the floor, faults in the ceiling, anything that Viola could shoot that was not the tech-priest himself. But Vius was too cunning, and he was moving too swiftly. One strike of the axe took Viola’s feet from under her and she crashed over sideways, her armour crunching as she hit the floor. Augusta shouted, ‘Melia! Take Rhea, and target Rayos! Find this mechanism! The rest of you, the skulls!’ ‘Aye!’ Both Sisters ran for the steps. The temple was filled with noise – the crash of metal boots on stone, the hammer and blast of bolter fire, the chiming rise of anger and song. The skulls hovered and faltered and fell, echoing hollowly as they cracked against the floor. But, even as Augusta turned her attention back to the heretek, they were rising again, answering to the endless data-stream of Vius’ commands. Augusta barked, ‘Concentrate your fire, Sisters! Keep them down!’ Bolters thundered. The heretek dominus had been right about one thing – if they did not bring him down, and swiftly, then they would not be able to deactivate the field. And if that happened… Focused now, Augusta freed her chainsword. Rasping it to full motion, she took one skull, then a second, clean out of the air. As one of them twitched back to life, she brought her boot down upon it, smashing it. She was shouting in the vox, ‘Rhea!’ and sparing the briefest of glances for the top of the steps. Framed by the lava-gleam of the forge-works, Rhea and Melia had parted to flank Rayos. The younger tech-priest’s movements were swift and fluid, her claws and tools keeping both Sisters back. She had been hit by Melia’s flamer once before, and was staying well out of its range. But Augusta had no time to bark further orders – Vius was still moving, now focused on Viola as the greatest threat. Even as the younger Sister rolled back to her feet, the axe struck her again, hard across the belly. Vius’ strength was incredible. Viola’s chestplate cracked clean through, and her breath whooshed out of her lungs. Her song fell from the air. Halfway to her feet, she went over once more, metal screeching on stone as she skidded backwards across the floor. Augusta’s sword took out another skull. ‘Rhea!’ Rhea’s voice in the vox: ‘I have it! It’s up there, Sister, behind the altar! It’s the pull switch on the right! We…’ Her words suddenly faltered, then faded to a crushed softness, like pure horror. ‘By the Light, he’s right. We cannot reach it.’ ‘What?’ Augusta took a split second to look, and to see what the Sister had meant. Along the back wall of the temple, high above the forge-works of the altar, there ran a steel gantry. It allowed a priest or servitor access to an array of prayer-screens, diagnostics, switches, levers, and gauges. But to reach it… To reach it, they would have to ascend a narrow metal ladder, covered by a cylindrical cage. Rhea – or Akemi – might have been able to fit through the cage’s gap… But not in full armour. And Rayos was still in the way. You will not… Augusta felt her heart freeze. Her mind turned over options – could she cut through it, perhaps? Could they occupy Vius and Rayos for long enough for one of the lighter Sisters to drop her wargear? But she knew the answer – Vius had anticipated this, all of this. The heretek dominus had calculated his ploy flawlessly, knowing they were helpless, drawing them in. So he could kill them all. A prayer formed in her heart, almost like a plea. She did not get the time to voice it. Vius lowered one limb, and there was a flare of rippling heat. Viola screamed in the vox, a noise that made Augusta’s hair stand on end. She did not move again. Without pause, he turned the arm on Akemi. Again, the air shimmered. She reeled backwards, throwing up her arms, then staggered and fell. Thin smoke stole from the joints in her armour. Dominica’s eyes! Augusta mouthed a horrified curse. Alcina, spitting the words of the litany, strode forwards as if she would take Vius apart with her gauntleted hands. At the top of the steps there was a burst of flame and a semi-mechanical hiss. The Sister Superior did not dare look. They were out of time; the squad was being taken to pieces. But they had to take down that force field, even if it cost them their lives. Our Emperor, deliver us! By the Light – Vius had known this, all of this. From the beginning, he’d known their numbers, their deployments, their plans. He had extrapolated their every move with the efficiency of pure critical analysis. Nothing they had done had surprised him, and here he was, at the last, mocking them with their failure. Knowing that he could take them down, one at a time, and that they could not touch him. That they could not reach the force field. That they must leave their Order to die. But there was no room for hopelessness, no option for despair. They would succeed, or they would perish trying. With unspoken agreement, Augusta and Alcina parted to divide Vius’ targeting, but the heretek dominus was pure, metallic symmetry, insectile and graceful, unassailable. Two-handed, now, Augusta slashed at his weapon arm with the running chainsword, but the effect was the same – the field sparked with energy and the blade simply bounced, the after-shock travelling up her arm. Alcina was still shooting, firing single shots at Vius’ back, but to no effect. She was knotted with anger, fearsome and furious. In the clash and the clatter, Augusta realised Alcina was a truly powerful fighter. But it was not enough. They had no weapon that could touch him, no way of reaching that switch. They were going to fail, not only themselves but the entirety of their Order… And then, Augusta realised something, like a shaft of pure light striking down through the red glow of the temple. His touch, in the heart of the heretek’s corrupted power. An answer. The thing that Vius had missed, the one variable that he had not calculated. The single member of this force that was not supposed to be here. Mors. As the realisation hit her, she flared with hope and defiance. She gave the squad a single command – alpha strike! – to concentrate everything they had on Rayos at the top of the steps. They had to get her out of the way. She said to Mors, ‘Can you get up there? Pull that switch?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Mors didn’t argue, and he didn’t waste time. He slung his rifle – he’d need both hands to climb – then ran for the altar. They both knew that as soon as either tech-priest saw him, he was dead. It was just a matter of time. Howling, Augusta drove at Vius with the chainsword, battering him back, holding his attention. Vius hissed. He seemed to retract into himself, then he lashed back out again like some coiled spring, that huge axe hammering with incredible mechanical force. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the flare of Melia’s flamer, saw Rayos go over; she saw Mors reach the ladder and swing himself onto it with a wiry and long-limbed strength. He shot upwards, in and under the cage, then out and onto the gantry. As his boots banged on the metal walkway, Vius turned. Augusta saw the tech-priest pause, saw his shock, saw all his limbs shift to aim at the running figure. She could taste his dismay, his split-second understanding of his error. The one thing he had not calculated. The thing that was about to bring him down. Vius raised the heat-weapon. Mors threw himself at the switch. The Sister Superior had barely a moment to understand that he’d made it, before the air of the temple shimmered. And Mors died instantly, in a hiss of superheated steam, much like Rufus had done. At the cave mouth, Captain Mulier’s words came through Caia’s vox-bead: ‘The field is down. Countdown begins at ninety… Eighty-nine…’ ‘Retreat!’ Even as the canoness gave the order, she was up and over the side of the Immolator. In the smoke and the noise, Caia heard the rumble as the vehicles started to turn. But there were machines still standing. The Sisters’ force had cut scores of them down and the canoness herself had slain too many to count. Still aloft, the three remaining Sera­phim covered the retreat – as the tanks turned, the airborne Sisters swooped and hammered, keeping the foes’ ranks back. Caia hung on as the Immolator reached full speed. Looking around, she counted the remaining tanks – one surviving Immolator, as well as their own, both Repressors, two Exorcists. If she glanced back, she could see the two fallen Seraphim, still and broken – her Sisters, fallen in battle, and never to be recovered. She offered a silent prayer, but the canoness was still barking orders. ‘Roll call!’ The responses were coming in – Eleni, Roku, Jolantra. Briefly, Caia wondered about her own squad. She offered her thanks for their success, and prayed that they were still standing. Behind them, the machines lumbered forwards. If they had previous orders not to leave the cavern, those orders had been superseded; as the tanks came out into the open and ­thundered, full-speed, back down towards the beach, the rattle and rumble of the mobile force followed them, harrying them all the way. In the back of the Immolator, Ianthe prayed, her words rising to the brass-clouded sky. Up there, somewhere, Captain Mulier was getting ready to fire. Ninety seconds. Augusta had not heard the broadcast, but she knew. And she knew that they would not have time. At the top of the steps, Rayos was down – her fallen form was smouldering under the burned remains of her cloak. This time, it seemed, Sister Melia had finished the task. But Vius was still upright, still fighting. And, though it would be the last thing she did, Augusta was going to take the heretek dominus down before the Kyrus killed them all. ‘Alcina!’ She barked the order. ‘Take the squad and go! Get clear if you can!’ Despite his failure, Vius was still focused, calculated and cold. His combat strikes remained implacable, relentless, one after another… Slash, slash, slash. Systematically, he pursued Augusta with the axe, constantly reversing his grip so he could strike from both sides. She snarled at him, parrying the blows, her arms jarring, her feet skidding, her chainsword reaching a high-pitched scream as the teeth caught on the axe-haft. In his other hands, targeting flawlessly, the stubber and the heat weapon still struck out at the squad. From somewhere, Rhea was shouting something, her tone urgent, but Augusta did not hear her, she was intent on Vius, looking for the opening, trying to get a strike through the tech-priest’s thought-swift defences. She was aware of the shimmer of the heat-weapon, of a dive-and-clatter as a figure in red armour rolled out of the way. And then, something in her crystallised – pure concentrated rage. In that split second, time seemed to slow. Her heart rate became a booming bass thrum in her ears; a new strength uncurled like light through her limbs. She would pay this heretek for every life he had taken, for her fallen Sisters, for Rufus, and for Mors. She would pay him for thinking he could take down her squad, and mock the Adepta Sororitas. Domine, libra nos! Despite the force field, she was gaining ground, pushing him back. The repeated strikes of the chainsword seemed to flow from her like pure song, like she had become a conduit for the entire fury of her Order. He was parrying almost frantically, sparks flying from the axe-haft. Alcina had not left; she was kneeling beside the fallen Viola. She, too, was shouting, but Augusta could not hear through the roar of blood in her ears. The Sister Superior was reciting the words of the litany like a drum-pulse chant, rhythmic and furious with the systematic, relentless attacks of the chainsword. She let her rage fill her with pure scarlet light, with the fire that was battle-focus and absolute certainty – this thing would die. Vius switched his axe again, striking from the other side. As he did so, she slammed it with her foot and knocked it sideways – he missed the blow and paused, just for a moment, but it was enough. There – there! – was the opening she sought! She slammed with the chainsword straight through his defences; his force field sparked and failed. The blade bit home, screaming its song of destruction. It was not enough to kill him, but his defences were down, now, and he could not free himself enough to move. He hissed at her, all his limbs mantling high over her shoulders… But it was too late. Alcina was moving; Rhea and Melia were still on their feet. Her Sisters had not left her. And they did the rest. Black ash, billowing in a bitter, metallic wind. This was the limit of the tanks’ retreat – the roadway was collapsed and they could not leave the island. The last of the machines were still behind them, lumbering down the road like monsters of nightmare, but they were not fast enough. Ianthe shoved herself and Caia both into the Immolator’s belly, and slammed the hatch. Over the vox, the canoness offered a prayer. And from the clouds, there came the pure white blaze of the Emperor’s light.",

      "content": "CHAPTER ELEVEN Rubble. It steamed in extreme heat; smoke and dirt billowed over its charred and mountainous ruin. But the tanks remained, tiny red fortresses at the edge of the destruction. Rayos’ machines had not been so blessed. Too slow, they had been caught by the wave of devastation. They lay twisted and blackened, their flesh melted, their metal crushed. A few had survived, but they had been easy to despatch. In the belly of the Immolator, the canoness was offering her thanks for His protection. Surrounded by the tank’s metal walls, Caia sat by Sister Rhene, her helm off, and swallowing tears – though there was no shame in grief, now the battle was over. Rhene sat with her, the old Hospitaller’s voice gentle. She said, ‘Your Sisters died with honour, Caia de Musa. They stand before the Golden Throne, and they stand blessed. They have succeeded in their mission, and shown great courage.’ ‘I know,’ Caia nodded, though she could say no more. Rhene touched her knee, gentle, like an elderly aunt. ‘I have seen many things, Sister Caia – battles and horrors, the rot and disease of the deepest mines, creations of warp and Ruin. I understand that there are greater wounds than battle injuries – and I know He sees them also. You worship Him with warfare, but to me, He is a figure of great healing. His peace be upon you, and His light in your soul.’ ‘Sometimes,’ the canoness said softly, ‘it takes more courage to survive. Fear not, Sister Caia, He has a plan for you. And He knows where you will–’ ‘Please, milady!’ At the canoness’ words, Caia looked up, her grief suddenly congealing into a cold and absolute dread. She had known, all along, that this was coming, known that the canoness had another plan for her. She said, ‘Please don’t expel me from the Order!’ Ianthe blinked. She should discipline Caia significantly, but she seemed almost confused. ‘Expel you, Sister?’ ‘I’m a warrior, your eminence. Have I not proven–’ ‘And why would you be anything else?’ There was a distinct note of warning in Ianthe’s tone. Caught, Caia paused, looking from canoness to Hospitaller and back. She said, the words falling over themselves, ‘Please, milady, my bloodline is too faint. I’m a second cousin of a second cousin, a grand-niece of a grand-niece. I know nothing of Spire politics. I could never be–’ ‘You forget yourself, Sister.’ The snap was back in the canoness’ voice. ‘I comprehend your grief, and I share it – but you will control your outbursts.’ ‘Milady.’ Caia inhaled, steadying herself, then let out a slow breath. During the battle, Ianthe had lost her distant, austere manner, and had become a figure of great passion and strength. Now, she returned to her unquestioned cold authority, and Caia, slightly belatedly, remembered her place. She lowered her gaze, ‘Your eminence.’ Rhene cackled, and patted Caia’s knee again. ‘You’ve conjured this dread for yourself, Sister Caia,’ she said. ‘Fear not, I do not see you in a decorous robe. Look at the state of you – the Orders Famulous would never accept a Sister so downright grubby.’ She continued to cackle, and Caia, feeling immensely foolish, lowered her head in a prayer. Augusta’s squad was a mess. Guided by Sister Rhea’s experiences upon Mete, carrying their injured Sisters, they had taken shelter in the depths of the librarium, a place of vast and crumbling data-banks, of Vastum’s rotting knowledge and forgotten resources. As the countdown had measured their lives in remaining seconds, they’d almost fallen down the long stairway and then, with a desperate prayer, they’d thrown themselves on the floor. And He had heard them. Shielded by the ancient Mechanicus’ stone and wisdom, scattered with falling dust and debris, the squad had survived the blast. Battered, exhausted and filthy, Augusta had offered a hymn to His foresight and mercy, and a prayer of thanks for the miracle. It seemed He was not ready to call them to the Throne – not yet. They’d stumbled through half-collapsed corridors, through rubble and rock and dust; they’d almost crawled, half-blind, over the burned-black stone, and at last, they’d found the beach where the tanks stood waiting. The canoness, Sister Caia with her, had come to meet them. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Augusta.’ ‘Ave Imperator, your eminence.’ At the limits of her endurance, Augusta pulled herself to her full height and returned the salute. She had Akemi over her shoulder; Viola was semi-conscious and being half-carried, half-dragged by Alcina and Melia; Rhea had Viola’s weapon as well as her own. ‘Sister Rhene will see to your injured,’ Ianthe said, indicating the Immolator. ‘Report.’ Right there, on the desolate black beach, the smoking ruin of the citadel behind her, Augusta gave that report. Her words were clipped, efficient, but aching with weariness. But when she reached the final battle, and the presence of the heretek dominus, Sister Alcina stepped forwards to stop her. ‘Permission to speak, milady,’ she said. ‘Granted,’ Ianthe answered. ‘Your eminence,’ Alcina said. ‘My orders were to report on the performance of Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, and of her squad. To assess whether the witch Scafidis Zale had left any touch of Ruin upon them, and to analyse their operation in the field.’ Augusta said nothing; she had known this was coming. But the fact that Alcina had spoken it openly… The canoness, it seemed, had drawn the same conclusion. ‘I take it, Sister Alcina, that your report is positive?’ ‘It is positive,’ Alcina said. ‘There is no touch of Ruin upon these Sisters, and they have conducted this mission with great courage.’ ‘And what of the deserter? Mors?’ ‘Both soldiers,’ Alcina said, ‘gave their lives, with honour, in the service of the Emperor.’ She made no attempt to explain further. Ianthe nodded, her eyes still scanning Augusta. Augusta noticed that she, too, was filthy, her armour dented, her face and hair covered in smears and grit. Caia, likewise, her armour dirty and battered with impacts. ‘I am glad,’ Ianthe said, at last. ‘Glad that He has blessed you, Sister Superior. You are warriors born, all of you, and I am proud to call you my Sisters. He has blessed us all, this day – we have achieved our mission, slain both the tech-priest and her collaborator, and prevented their corrupted army from leaving this world. We have survived, Sisters, and we will return to the Convent Sanctorum to give our thanks.’ She cast a rueful eyebrow at the beach and the fallen roadway. ‘Though,’ she said, ‘I fear that may be a while. It seems He still has work for us to do.’",

      "content": "Grimdak liked stomping. It wasn’t that he was big, exactly; the boss was bigger. But Grimdak was smart. Grimdak knew all the best places, all the best scraps and corners and heaps of junk. An’ besides, the boss wasn’t out here, and right now, that made Grimdak the biggest ork there was. Da biggest ork on da walkway. That, and his deffgun was the bestest. Stamping down the rusting, rotting tunnels of the great hulk, his muscled shoulders catching on hanging cables and old supports, his red eyes looking for the shiny, Grimdak liked the weight it gave him. He’d made it himself, because of course he had, scavenging the ruin for some bits, trading what he found for others. Razgog’d even let him use the mekboy workshop, so long as he did some of the welding and cutting. And that meant his deffgun was ginormous. It made him heavier, stronger. And it made his stomping loud, his boots bashing good on the metal. He liked the echoes, the banging percussion that said: Da ork is comin’! Faded lumens flickered at the noise, showering sparks as he passed them; they made shadows jump along the walls, shapes like threats. As his own outline fell ahead of him, he let off a burst of rounds, just because he could. It boomed and roared and deafened him, but he liked it. He liked the spank of the ricochets, the big explosions that bellowed back from the far end of the tunnel. He liked the creaking and the smashing that came after. They told everything to get outta da bleedin’ way! Yaaah! His deffgun was good, turning anything to a greasy smear. Carrying it, Grimdak wasn’t scared of nothing. Not those big scuttlies – fast, but not fast enough. Not those poncy, prancy things with their stupid hair, or those ranks of boring robots. Grimdak’d even seen a Space Marine once, hiding his backside in all that snazzy armour. Hadn’t done him any good – the boss still wore his pauldrons. Remembering the battle, he snickered round his teeth. That’d been a big one, but Zoldag Legmangla, warboss, had claimed this hulk for the Deathskullz, and he wasn’t giving it up. The Space Marine’s skull, helmet and all, sat atop the warboss’ throne. And his boyz’d never had it so good. Two levels down and a big bag of loot later, Grimdak stopped by a ruined control panel. Its screen was shattered, half chewed off; its wires hung loose. They were red and gleaming, spilled like guts, and he knew that colour of metal. Razgog needed it, it was good stuff for fixing busted connections. Yanking the front fully off the thing, he poked it with a curious talon, waiting to see if it’d catapult him back down the walkway… Was slightly disappointed when nothing happened. In the stomp-free quiet, however, he heard a noise. A noise like boots. Big boots. Grimdak stopped. Legmangla’s Skullz owned the hulk, but them was boots, all right. Loud boots, metal boots. Boots that moved all tidy-like. Military boots. Not as big as the Space Marine, but big enough. They were still some distance away, somewhere down by the old genny-rators, he reckoned. But he was sure of one thing… Them boots weren’t orks. He frowned, scratching hard at one metal-pierced ear. Bits of snotling were still caught in it, but he wasn’t worried about that now. Fink, he told himself. The boss’ hulk was called Da Big Mouf and it was bleedin’ huge. It was more than one ship, all smushed together and stuck like that, roaring on though the void. It had lots of different ends and bits, sticking out all over the place, plus the central vortex that had given it its name – something to do with the tangled gravities of the individual ships. The boss’ throne was a way back, on the biggest command deck; the escape pods were used by the mekboyz; and old Skalagrog preached and sparked and ranted his way through the lower tunnels. Even the gunnery decks, used for sleeping and eating and fighting, were– Them boots were getting closer. He scratched his ear a bit harder, then inspected his claw and chewed the filth out of it. He was too big to sneak, and, anyhow, that wasn’t the way. He was an ork, the biggest baddest ork on the walkway. With the biggest, baddest deffgun. Yeah! Da loota wiv da shoota! Hoiking the thing a bit higher on his shoulder, he folded down the targeter and kicked in the scanners. I is da big ork! An’ I is gonna finds ya! The boots were a level below him, he reckoned, down in the old helot tunnels where some of the mangled servitors still roamed, every one of them mad as a bucket of snotlings. Sometimes, if he needed the really good swag, he went down there after them. The ladder was nearby, and though its rungs were busted, he’d be able to see straight down. Yeah, like shootin’ humies in a barrel! Grinning though his snaggled fangs, he stomped that way. And then, he heard something else. Arriving back at the warboss’ throne, Grimdak skidded to a stop in a state of almost-panic. ‘Boss!’ He was pointing frenziedly behind him, though the deffgun made it almost impossible for him to turn. ‘We gots trouble! I see’d ’em! Dey’s comin’, an’ dey got boltas, an’ shootas an’ ’eavy fings. An’ fings dat…’ Catching Legmangla’s lava-eyed glare, he shut his mouth. Backed up a prudent step. Framed by a wealth of trophies, the warboss unfolded to his feet. Zoldag was huge, his shoulders fully big enough to fill the yellow pauldrons, his ears heavy with scavenged metal. Parts of his armour were made from black chitin, and he bore a necklace of mismatched skulls. His filed teeth were tipped in sharpened steel and covered in shreds of Gork-alone-knew-what. And his left arm was fully augmetic, ending in a four-taloned claw bigger than Grimdak’s head. The claw had come from a Dreadnought. And Grimdak should know – he’d found the bleedin’ thing. At the warboss’ feet, a twitching gretchin stood ready to run his errands. ‘You wot?’ Legmangla rumbled, a bubbling snarl that started deep in his chest. It echoed round the throne room’s crumbling panels like a rolling boulder. Words tripping over themselves, Grimdak tried to explain. ‘Dey… dey’s humies, boss, an’ dey gots all the armour. Shiny. Yeah, good. But dey was singin’…’ He got no further. The warboss gave a rippling roar, the noise enough to make the gretchin cower and cover its ears. Grimdak gulped, but refused to let himself flinch. Good thing too, as the boss idly booted the smaller creature and sent it sailing into an upper support. It squeaked in protest, crunched with the impact and crashed to the floor. It didn’t move again. Stamping down three steps, Legmangla fixed Grimdak with a baleful, scarlet glower. ‘You runned away. You saw da humies, an’ you runned away.’ He bared his fangs, his breath reeking. ‘Is you an ork, or is you a stinkin’, snivellin’ grot?’ ‘I is an ork, boss.’ Grimdak backed up another step. ‘I… I jus’ came to tells ya! Bring ya da newz. An’ I gots…’ With his best ingratiating grin, he grabbed a fistful of his captured swag, and held it out. The boss paused, eyeing the copper wire. On the floor between them, at the foot of his seat, lay his huge pile of scavenged booty – more bits of Space Marine and Dreadnought, the claws of a genestealer, the plume from an aeldari helm. The Apothecary’s narthecium, his proudest possession. It glinted like an evil grin. Legmangla eyed the wires, then the pile, then rumbled again, apparently thinking. Then he bellowed, loud enough to rattle the ancient glass screens. ‘Baz!’ Grimdak backed up even further, smack into the ork behind him. He jumped, turned. And there was Bazruk da Stompa, ork nob, casually picking his fangs with a long and dirty spike. He leered down, grinning. ‘Awright, loota?’ His words were easy, dangerous. ‘Wot’s you done now?’ ‘Nuffink,’ Grimdak said quickly, scrambling out of the way. Bazruk’s grin grew. Behind him, more orks tumbled into the chamber, nobz and boyz, weapons in hands. A scatter of gretchin came with them, darting between their feet and trying not to get stomped on. Bazruk snarled at the massed pack, and it scuffled and shoved to quiet, waiting. Legmangla eyed his troops. ‘Awright,’ he said. ‘Grimdak’s gots us somethin’ speshal.’ He grinned, a mouthful of knives. ‘Dere’s humies in da tunnels, an’ dey gots da good loot. An’ by the teefs of Gork an’ Mork, we’s gonna finds ’em an’ we’s gonna stamp on their ’eads. We’s gonna breaks dem outta dere shells, and squish all dere pink insides.’ The grin grew. ‘An’ I’s gonna gets meself a bran’ new prize.’ He threw a thumb over his shoulder, at the helm that topped the throne. ‘A li’l one, ta go by da big one.’ Orks nudged each other, snickering. But Legmangla’s grin vanished. Fangs bared, his red gaze moved from ork to ork like a laser sight. It settled on Grimdak. ‘But,’ he said. ‘Before we gets stuck in, you tell me somethin’.’ Greenskins eyed each other, their boots. Not one of them met the warboss’ gaze. Still glaring at Grimdak, he said, ‘Oo founds da relic?’ Grimdak blinked. ‘Wot?’ ‘Relic?’ Mutters and shuffles; each ork glared at his nearest neighbours. ‘Wot relic?’ Leaning casually on the nearest upright, Bazruk continued to pick his teeth. Greatly daring, Grimdak answered, ‘We ain’t gots no relics, boss.’ He pointed at the throne, the pile. ‘All da good stuff’s dere. No relics!’ ‘Dem singin’ humies, dey always come afta da relics,’ Legmangla said, his tone spelling it out. He fixed Grimdak with a nasty stare, and Grimdak gulped. He had no idea if Legmangla could swallow the deffgun as well as the ork that carried it, and he didn’t want to find out. After all, look at what’d happened to ol’ Scarmush. Never mind that now. Bristling, Legmangla stomped down the last two steps. Still framed by the loot-encrusted throne-back, his pile of his swag at his boots, he made a swipe at where Grimdak was standing. The loota jumped out the way, but Legmangla’s grab had not been aimed at him. Bazruk cursed as the toothpick was snatched from his hand. ‘’Ere! Dat’s…!’ The boss growled him to silence, examined the spike, then shook it, right in Bazruk’s face. ‘Wot’s dis, den?’ he roared. ‘Da ’and of bleedin’ Mork?’ Faced by the boss, even Bazruk backed up. He looked around him for support, but every other ork in the room was studiously staring elsewhere. ‘I… Uh…’ The boss shook it again. ‘Where’d ya gets dis?’ ‘Dere was a coffin?’ Bazruk ventured. ‘Big stone fing? Out near da mouf–’ With a roar, Legmangla lunged. He drove the toothpick, sharp end first, straight through the hollow of Baz’s throat. Bazruk gawked, startled, then went over backwards with a crash. He gagged, choked, kicked, and was still. Gore seeped out across the slatted metal floor. Orks chuckled and snorted; a few kicked at the downed body, just for good measure. But Legmangla was not laughing. With a bellow, he brought the boyz to stillness. ‘When you gets da loot, you brings it ’ere!’ One massive boot kicked the glinting pile. ‘You gots that? You don’ts use it ta picks ya teef!’ Bazruk’s toothpick was now stuck straight up in the air like a monument, marking where the nob’s stupidity had ended. Its blunt end, Grimdak realised, was the familiar round hip joint of an ancient, humie thigh bone. And, while he couldn’t read them, the thing was engraved with words, all the way down. ‘Oops,’ he commented, when Legmangla couldn’t hear. ‘WAAAGH!’ Bellowing, bristling with weapons, the boyz surged out of the airlock door, running straight for the main companionway. Grimdak had tried to sidle from the boss’ line of sight, but Legmangla grabbed him by one ear, and dragged him right up the front. ‘You found ’em,’ he said. ‘You go finds ’em again.’ ‘Boss.’ In the deffgun, he had a motion detector, of sorts. It was a bit twitchy – picked up the bilge rats sometimes – but it was enough. With Legmangla pounding beside him, and a surge of gleeful greenskins behind, he ran. We gonna krush dem humies good an’ propa! At first, however, the hulk seemed empty. Covered in the orks’ garish graffiti, it clanged and bashed and echoed to the sounds of their charge, creaking and groaning. Squeaky things scattered from the orks’ boots; they stamped at them, laughing. Junctions and ladders were daubed with colours and pictures and warnings, with the skull symbols of their tribe and with caricatures of its various members. In other places, old Skalagrog had sent up warnings, standing totems of bones and captured booty. Marking the parts of Legmangla’s territory, they said: Don’t mess wiv da orks! Skalagrog himself had joined them, though the rest of the tribe were giving him a wide berth. More than one ork had met a sizzle-fried end when ol’ Skalagrog got carried away. They sang as they ran: ‘Mash ’em, bash ’em! Crunch ’em, munch ’em! We da boyz, an’ we lives ’ere! Fite ’em, smite ’em! Beats ’em, eats ’em! We da boyz, we gots no fear!’ As they chanted, they pushed and shoved, mocking and jostling. Bazruk’s demise had left a gap, and the biggest of the remaining orks were eager to fill it. At the back, a few voices started raggedly shouting, ‘’Ere we go, ’ere we go, ’ere we go!’ Grimdak, however, didn’t join the fun. His feet bashed to the main rhythm, but he was watching the motion detector in his flip-down eyepiece. Nuffink. Occasional, scuttling blips – more rats, and a distance away; there was nothing big enough, or well-ordered enough, to be the force he’d seen. And he could feel the close, watchful rumble of Legmangla’s authority. It said: Don’t get dis wrong, loota. The tribe continued to chant: ‘Thump ’em, whump ’em! Crash ’em, bash ’em! We da boyz, an’ we’s awright! Tromp ’em, stomp ’em! Smack ’em, whack ’em! We da boyz, an’ we can fight!’ Steadily, the companion-route led out into the main body of the hulk. The graffiti faded back to red and gnawing rust, and the lumens grew weaker, casting almost no light. Around them, the space soon opened out into a vast and looming darkness, and their boots rang hollow on the now suspended walkway. A cold and empty wind began to pluck at them, teasing. It stank of dead stuff. Here, Grimdak wanted to slow down. He was smart, right; he knew the hulk better than his mates, and he knew that they were heading for the central hub, for the point where the vast ships all collided. He’d seen it many times, all the tunnels that led up and out and away, and at impossibly bonkers angles that just hurt your brain… And out there, in the middle of it all, was the thing that Legmangla had called the ‘mouf’. It was ever-hungry, the place where everything twisted, round and round, pulling everything down into itself. Grimdak didn’t know where the stuff went, though Razgog had once tried to explain to him. He did know, though, that more than one ork had got too close, trying to prove how scared he wasn’t, and had gone bawling over the railings. It wasn’t long before they all felt the change, the charge, the sucking greed in the air. ‘Fink you’s big, wiv all dat noize? Gots news for youz, ’cause we’s DA BOYZ!’ The chant reached its end, bled out into the open darkness. The air was full of sounds: phantom yells, cries that they couldn’t quite hear, the creak and grind of unsettled metal. The orks turned grim, stamping fast and focused, their faces furrowed, fangs bared. Yeah, Grimdak thought, as they closed on the location of the vortex. Mouf or no mouf, dey wuz ready. The ambush hit them hard. Grimdak had not seen motion; there was only the sudden flare of muzzle flash, the boom of heavy weapons, the rip and roar of carbide fusion rounds, cutting through air and flesh and metal. And singing, the sort of powerful, humie tunes that could only mean one thing. The loota bellowed a warning, but the noise was lost in the racket. Cries, shrieks, shouts. Detonations, sudden splotches of exploding warmth. Flying flesh. Tumbling bodies. Orks cursing and colliding, the confused bang of their boots and the screeches of crushed gretchin. The whoosh of a handheld flamer. Burning boyz, stumbling into each other or from the walkway’s edge. Falling, flailing sideways as the vortex took them and gobbled them down. The spang of a snapped cable and the walkway lurching, knocking boyz from their feet… Grimdak stayed upright, his legs splayed apart, riding the slewing metal with knees like gimbals; his motion detector was blipping, movement ahead and behind. Two, four, six dots. Six? Dat was all? But the ambush had been well placed. Here, the bridge was curving through a right angle, avoiding the sick, dark whirl of the mouf, and the boyz were straggled out, all around the curve. Illuminated only by erratic flashes of gunfire, Grimdak could just make out the attackers, a distance back. Three at the front, their ceramite armour gleaming darkly scarlet, their cloaks in black and white, and flapping in the vortex’s wind. ‘WAAAGH!’ Legmangla bawled the command. Howling, the orks attacked. The bark and roar of weapons fire, the flash of axes in the half-light. Right at the front, Grimdak targeted the deffgun. The boss thundered past him, claw champing, his captured tech-priest choppa ready in his other hand. With a yell of his own, the loota opened fire. The weapon boomed, the noise incredible; it crashed back from the metalwork like some vast, steel drumbeat. The red-clad figure in front of him was smaller than the others; he could see the distinctive pattern of its helmet, its bolter held hard in both hands. His suppression went over the humie as it dropped neatly sideways, then rolled back up, still shooting. Behind it, explosions blossomed, the flames sucked away by the vortex’s pull. The walkway shivered, quaked again. The whirl sucked and crackled and spat. Eager. Starving. Grimdak roared, bared his teeth. ‘We iz da orks!’ In the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. There were bodies everywhere, orks shooting back, orks falling down. Bolter rounds struck the loota and spanged, repelled by the deffgun’s shoulder-mount. He juddered at the impacts, but he didn’t go over. Sparks burned his cheek. Shouts were rising now, boots crashing in an upsurge of defiance. ‘We owns da hulk!’ ‘We’s gonna krush!’ ‘Stompin’ an’ shootin’! Stompin’ an’ shootin’!’ Ahead of Grimdak, Legmangla hurled his full body weight at the central armoured figure, bigger than the other two. The figure let off a shot with the bolter, then stepped from the warboss’ path. With a tidy throw-and-catch, it reversed its grip on its weapon and slammed the butt sideways into the ork’s face. Snarling, Legmangla lashed out with the choppa, simultaneously slamming the claw into the figure’s chestplate, then opening it out to gouge a screaming hole in the metal. In the flashes, Grimdak could make out the third figure, a flamer in its gauntleted hands. The singing continued, like knives in Grimdak’s brain. ‘Down!’ he yelled, and the warboss ducked. The flamer’s gout missed him, and torched the two orks behind. A detonation of ammunition was sucked away by the mouf. But Grimdak only glanced; he didn’t have time to waste. He heard shouts, crashing, smashing, roaring, shooting, pandemonium. Another cable spanged, the walkway lurched again. He could hear Skalagrog chanting, feel the flicker and flash of his gathering power, fed by the other orks. Mork alone knew what good that would do… ‘Grim!’ The boss’ command was a bark. ‘Go gets da big shoota!’ ‘Boss!’ Understanding, Grimdak dropped back towards the corner. In front of him, Legmangla executed his signature move, stamping sideways on his enemy’s knee, and snapping it clean, armour and all. The figure went over, but still managed to reverse its grip, again, on the weapon and shoot upwards at the boss’ head. It missed. The flamer roared again, the wash of its heat enough to crisp the hairs in Grimdak’s nose. The flames, like everything else, were sucked sideways and away. Then a roaring gaggle of boyz broke past him, heading for the attackers, and he was abruptly caught in the centre of the mêlée. And Mork’s teef, it was a mess. There were orks everywhere, getting in his way, tripping him over as he tried to move. They were confused, some injured, some dying; the pull of the air was tugging them all towards the walkway’s now-dangling edge. In some places, they fought back, bawling defiance; in others they struggled with the fall, or with each other. Gretchin scampered here and there, some of them trying to fight, others chortling gleefully and looting their downed comrades. One squeaked protest as the hulk’s mouf took him; he was a thrashing silhouette, and then he was gone. Somewhere, Grimdak could hear the roar and whip-crack of their herder, demanding that they ‘Attack da humies!’ Somewhere else, there was still Skalagrog, crackling like a bared wire, now, and ready to throw his bright and unstable energy in all directions… But hey, it meant that Grimdak could see. Kicking at a grabbing green hand, he turned the corner fully. And found turmoil. Three more figures were standing at the back of the ambushed tribe, one with a running chainsword, another with a heavy bolter, aimed from the hip, and all covered in shiny symbols. One part of his brain jumped up and down at the find, desperately wanting to grab the things and get them back to the workshop – the stuffs that Razgog could make! – but the other part was smarter, and could see the devastation that the weapon had made. Even as he looked, there was a bellow, and four of the biggest nobz charged straight at the attackers. The one with the heavy weapon dropped back, still firing, then clunked to a halt. The figure swore. The first two orks were caught by the suppression; they shuddered at repeated impacts, skidding to the floor. Another went down to the third figure, a shot going clean through his forehead. Ragbad, unhurt, surged forwards. But the figure with the chainsword came to meet him, and Grimdak stopped. Though not as big as the one Legmangla had charged, it moved like pure, tight hostility, smooth and furious. Sneering, Ragbad raised his forearm to block, and the blade just carved straight through, shrieking briefly as it cut the bone. Rag screeched like failing steel, but kept going, trying to leap on the figure and bear it to the ground. ‘Yaaaa! I don’t needs me arm anyhowz!’ The figure stepped back, bringing the chainsword up, two-handed, and cutting him almost clear in half, armour and all. For a split second, Grimdak stopped, gawking. But Legmangla was still up, still bellowing ‘WAAAGH!’ Belatedly, the loota opened fire; hit all three figures with a full suppression. The heavy weapon was down, changing magazine; he saw his own rounds spark from the thing, flashes of violent orange. They chewed a line across the user’s armour, throwing it backwards. It screamed at him, savage, rolling back to its feet. ‘Domine! Libra Nos!’ He bellowed back, ‘I iz da bestest ork! Da loota wiv da shoota!’ With a cry like pure rage, the figure with the chainsword came forwards, the weapon still running, sending flicks of Rag’s gore to spatter against the metalwork. Grimdak lowered the muzzle of the deffgun and hit it with a full, directed burst– The deffgun jammed. ‘Mork’s teef!’ he cursed, backing up fast. More of the tribe surged past him, Skalagrog included. The enemy bolter took out one target, two, then was buried by a pile of green. But Grimdak wasn’t looking, he was trying to unjam the– Skalagrog struck. A blaze of static energy exploded on the walkway, its lightning slanting towards the vortex. In response, the deffgun crackled and sparked, and the motion detector in his eyepiece went dead. ‘Wot’s you doin’, you–’ The full blaze of Skalagrog’s fury hit the chainsword figure in the chest. The figure stood stock-still for moment, its armour sputtering, smoking at the shoulders and ablaze with every colour Grimdak could name… ‘Yaaaa!’ Somewhere, Legmangla was still shouting; Grimdak couldn’t turn but he figured the boss was ripping his way through the enemy, breaking legs and heads. The flamethrower coughed again, a wide arc of fire. Gretchin screamed, fell. Their flesh aflame, they were everywhere and underfoot. More of them were tumbling from the walkway now, being sucked sideways into the vortex. And the vortex… The mouf was growing. Grimdak didn’t understand it, and Razgog wasn’t there to ask, but the lightning flashes of old Skalagrog’s energies were being sucked sideways, just like the fallen orks. And the mouf was getting bigger, tugging at hair and pulling flame and smoke and flesh down into its ever-churning belly. And then, the unthinkable happened. Grimdak didn’t see it, but he heard the noise. A third spang as another cable snapped, and the walkway lurched again, now swinging dangerously in the vortex’s winds. Impossible corridor angles led away in all directions; they messed with his head, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was the roar of rage as Legmangla lost his footing. The walkway itself was twisting, now, screeching in protest; it hurt Grimdak’s eyes to look at it. Then something massive skidded past him, grappling for hold, and went straight off the walkway’s edge. With a gawp of disbelief, Grimdak saw Legmangla shoot past him, swearing. But the boss didn’t fall. The Dreadnought claw lashed out, grabbed the railing, and hung on. He swung there, over the drop. The walkway creaked and groaned at the boss’ massive weight, twisting even further. More and more orks were losing their footing now, shrieking obscenities. Skalagrog was sliding. Grimdak, too. Legmangla hung over the drop, kicking his boots, snarling in outrage. From the armoured enemy, a barked command. Responding instantly, the heavy weapon opened fire – straight down. For an instant, Grimdak didn’t realise what they were doing, but he caught himself up as the rounds chewed holes in the metal, and the part the orks were standing on started to come away. The walkway screamed as it tore, the noise cutting at his ears. His deffgun was too heavy. Any bleedin’ minute…! Grimdak had a split second to make a decision. In front of him, the three attackers were now standing on a stable steel platform, its edge cut free. The vortex was growing, reaching out hungrily as more orks slipped towards it. Skalagrog’s lightnings seemed to be feeding it, somehow, making it– No time, Grimdak told himself. You’s da smart ork. Fink! To the front, one of the figures was tending to their downed mate; the other one, the small one, was covering, bolter ready. As he glanced, he saw the bolter was aimed at the still-dangling warboss, his claw slammed closed on the creaking railing. And Legmangla’s huge weight was pulling the whole walkway down. Cut free at its other end, it was starting to hinge like a door… Grimdak couldn’t back up – the walkway was broken and the heavy weapon would cut him to pieces. He had to go forwards… Jump! Legmangla caught his gaze and said something, the words torn away by the vortex. But Grimdak was past caring. There was an old ork saying, he remembered, one that Razgog lived by. Not the biggest ork in the tribe, the mekboy was definitely the smartest – he wasn’t out here, for a start. ‘Bestest way to win when dere’s too many?’ Raz had once said. ‘S’called da Air Gap Teknik.’ ‘Wot?’ Grimdak had asked him. ‘Air gap, clunk-brain. Da bigger da betta.’ Fink, Grimdak told himself, again. Razgog had been right – he knew what to do. And besides, the mekboy was still in the workshop, and Grim knew the hulk – he could circle back around the mouf, back to the warboss’ chambers… Pick up the relic. The good loot. Warbosses came and went, but Grim… yeah, he always survived. I iz da smart ork. Letting off a single, suppressive volley at the three figures, he made them keep their heads down. Then he jumped, right for their position. They swore, swinging weapons to cover him, but he was fast, deffgun or not. He broke past the bolter-figure and the crouched one with the flamer, and he just ran for it. As he did so, he heard the massive screeching creak as the railing finally gave way and Legmangla tumbled, howling, towards the vortex. He didn’t know what had happened to Skalagrog and he didn’t pause to worry. He put his head down, and he ran. Behind him, the figures were moving. A bolter round whisked past his ear; he heard the cough of the flamer, felt it singe his skin. Flames chasing him down the tunnel, Grimdak made his escape. ‘Well, Sisters?’ Her armour still crackling, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus switched off the chainsword’s mechanism. Viola, despite the line of dents in her chestplate, was covering the still-whirling vortex; Caia was checking the auspex for anything else incoming. On the far side of the now-fallen walkway, Sister Alcina was down. Melia was on one knee beside her, sanguinator in hand. Akemi covered them both, but her attention was on the fleeing ork with the shoulder-mounted weapon. ‘Permission to go after the greenskin?’ she said. ‘Denied,’ Augusta said. ‘Our priority is the mission. We have one Sister badly injured, and we’re running out of time. We must locate our target. Melia, did you catch it as it fled?’ ‘I believe so,’ Melia answered. ‘It wasn’t quite fast enough.’ ‘Enough that we’ll know it if we see it again,’ Akemi commented. ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘I hate to leave a loose ork roaming, and we should move location before it comes back with reinforcements. Caia, do you have a lead on the relic?’ ‘Report said it was in the casket on the nose of the Might in Vengeance,’ Caia said. ‘But we know the casket’s empty. I suggest we find the warboss’ hoard. If it’s anywhere…’ ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘Melia, can Alcina be moved?’ ‘I can move, Sister.’ Alcina’s voice was hoarse, but determined. ‘But I fear I will not be swift.’ ‘Truly, the Emperor is with you, Sister Alcina,’ Augusta commented, a smile in her tone. ‘You are made of His mettle.’ With a groan, the squad’s second came to her feet, staggered, righted herself. The hole in her armour was impressive, but beneath it, Melia’s skills had stopped her bleeding. ‘He is with all of us,’ Alcina answered. ‘Now, if the holy thigh bone of Saint Finiang is here, then we had better regroup, and seek it swiftly.’",

      "content": "Lightning tore through the sky. Seen through the cathedral’s massive glassaic window, it was a pure and holy wrath, flashing His image to brilliance. ‘O most Holy Emperor, grant to our Sister eternal rest!’ Beneath Him, at the altar, the slight, grey-robed form of the canoness raised her arms to His glory, her voice in the sacred requiem. Rolls of thunder joined her words, rumbling at the building’s walls, beating down upon its high and vaulted roof. ‘Let the light of your Throne shine upon her!’ Below the elderly figure, her congregation were mesmerised. In the foremost pew, helm off and head bowed as was proper, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus suppressed a shiver at His manifest might. His storm reigned perpetual, here on this tiny, forgotten world. ‘Hear my prayer, O Emperor. To you, all lives are owed! To you, all flesh must come!’ The requiem was unaccompanied – no organ, no music. Its harmonies were dense but unfamiliar, twisting through the acoustics in an eerie, minor key. Sister Akemi, to Augusta’s left side, shifted, shot a glance along the pew at Sister Melia. The storm grumbled on, like the anger in grief. Behind Augusta’s squad, the Sisters of the canoness’ Order and their frateris militia raised their own voices, responding to the litany. ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ The service was a funeral. Despatched by the Ecclesiarchy and newly arrived upon Letum, Augusta had not known the young Sister who had passed to His grace. She’d had no time to speak to the canoness personally; instead, she had respectfully agreed to attend the service. But this… The image in the great Sol-facing window was not Him in His full glory, armoured and bearing His bright and flaming sword – it was Him as He would be, ancient and enthroned in cables. Before it, four ancient servo-skulls hovered like guardians, their metal corroded, but their green eyes sharp as gemstones. She could not shake the feeling that they watched her, analysing what they saw. Carefully, she honoured the hymn, though the responses were unknown. ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ The lightning flashed again, causing His image to blaze, for a split second, out across the nave, almost like He had been there in person. Chilled to the absolute bone by the undisciplined thought, Augusta offered a penitent prayer. Such was arrogance, and unforgiveable. This place was unsettling, true, but that was not a justification. Sister Viola, always the hothead, cursed under her breath. Alcina, the squad’s second-in-command, snapped the ghost of an order and Viola subsided. But Augusta’s odd, visceral shudder did not. Tiny and isolated, cut off by His never-ceasing storm, the Sisters of this convent were completely unknown. They wore no armour, their robes and cloaks were a beautifully embroidered grey, and rather than a fleur-de-lys, their faces were tattooed with the outline of a skull. They called themselves the Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. Letum was a cemetery planet, a world of gravestones and towering, carved sarcophagi. In millennia past, it had been a resting place for the Imperium’s most honoured dead, and a silent, stone civilisation had grown out around its endless corpses – spreading grids of sunken walkways, shrines and chapels like ossuaries, all studded with bones, locked reliquaries where only He still remembered their contents. Once, pilgrims had come here, to study the headstones or to tend to them – but no pilgrim had touched this world in centuries. Not since the coming of the storm and its restless, magnetic field. Any ship attempting to land here would be brought down by His lightning. The Imperium’s bureaucracy had known this, but Letum had little intrinsic value – no wealth or resources. Lost somewhere between endless scriveners, and now both unreachable and unimportant, it had been abandoned, and left to its veneration of death. Augusta stole a look upward, her head still bowed, her bobbed hair falling grey past her ears. Atop the altar, as grey as everything else, lay an open coffin; within it, the young Sister who had passed. The coffin was steel, beautifully wrought and etched in skulls; at either end, a conducting rod connected it to the cathedral’s outside wall. The thunder growled low, like anticipation. With the sound, the congregation’s expectancy rose. The canoness still prayed, her arms aloft, her words a torch, a hymn, a tocsin. ‘He comes!’ she said, her tone livid with passion. ‘Let us witness the touch of His light!’ Perhaps the flash of His image had been less arrogance, Augusta thought, and more a deliberate illustration of this convent’s empathic belief. But still, her shudder did not fade. She should have more discipline. Praying, she focused her thoughts. The canoness’ voice rose further. She had her congregation gripped, the three pews of her Sisters, the frateris further back. Her head tilted back, strands of her white hair floating upwards round her face, she was entreating His storm for its touch, calling it to her. And, much as Augusta tried to banish the unworthy thought, the storm seemed to be listening. The flashes, vivid and shocking, were coming closer; the gap between the light and the sound narrowed with every strike. Even as the Sister Superior stole another look, a crashing rumble of thunder sounded directly overhead. There was the sudden hiss of rain against the glassaic. The canoness cried, ‘Bring mercy! Release our Sister to your storm!’ Propelled, the congregation were on their feet. They returned her words, but their cries were staccato, now, scattered throughout the nave and rapidly becoming louder. Frenzy rang from them like the clashing of cymbals. ‘Release!’ ‘Have mercy!’ ‘He comes!’ Uneasy, Sister Viola flashed a look over her shoulder. As Augusta glanced sideways, she crossed gazes with the younger Sister’s bright green eyes, saw flickers of both concern and non-comprehension. Briefly, Viola raised an eyebrow, but Augusta only frowned, indicating that she should attend to her prayers. The canoness cried again, ‘He comes!’ ‘He comes!’ ‘Praise His lightning!’ ‘Praise it!’ Another flash. Another bellow, loud enough to shake the bell towers. Augusta prayed, then found herself catching her breath… For here, even as His image flashed down upon the altar itself, bright yellow crackled along the conducting rods, a spark like pure, bared adrenaline. The congregation cried aloud, one long, ‘Ah!’ And light detonated from the metal coffin. It was blinding, but the Sister Superior held her place, blinking the after-flash from her vision. His touch was gone. Instead, flames were crackling, warm and soft, from the coffin’s contents. There was the faint smell of burning wood and flesh; grey smoke curled, thick and greasy. Extractors hummed, though she could not see them. The still-hovering skulls glittered in new firelight. They grinned, wide and toothy, as though they had seen this a thousand times, yet had never tired of it. As though they knew secrets they would never tell. ‘By the Throne…’ Shaken, Viola swore again, her words a whisper. This time, neither Alcina nor Augusta corrected her. Whatever this funeral service was, the squad had never seen its like. The storm crashed in violent farewell, then, slowly, began to rumble away. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ voice was calm with authority, soft with age. Sitting by a polished table of real wood, its surface reflecting electro-candles and the red light of the hearth, she was a tiny figure, creased with the weight of years. ‘Milady,’ Augusta answered respectfully. ‘Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, Order of the Bloody Rose.’ She offered the sign of the aquila. ‘Ave Imperator.’ Following the recessional, the canoness had bade them follow in her footsteps. The walk through the bone-walled cloisters had been as unnerving as everything else, but the librarium was warm and the storm kept at bay by the thickness of both walls and curtains. ‘Indeed,’ the canoness said. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior. His blessing upon you, and upon your squad. You will forgive me, I hope, for insisting that you attend our service? Sister Clara was very dear to me, as novice and as tender both, and while I know she kneels now at the foot of the Great Throne, I confess that I shall miss her.’ She smiled, the expression gentle. ‘His ways are strange, are they not?’ At Augusta’s left shoulder, Alcina answered, ‘It is not our place to question them, milady.’ ‘Of course, of course.’ Without losing her smile, the canoness gestured for the Sister to subside. ‘Yet I find that age has brought a… certain restlessness to my soul. It is unusual for anyone, upon our world so tiny, to live to the years that I have done. And I find myself lonely, eagerly awaiting my turn for His greatest blessing.’ To Augusta’s other side, Melia and Caia, one as dusky as the other was blonde, exchanged a glance. They were close as blood-kin, had come up through the schola together – the nearness of the canoness to her friend would touch them deeply. Sister Viola, here bereft of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter, creaked as she shifted on her toes; the last and youngest member of the squad, Sister Akemi, was gazing raptly round at the bookshelves, lured by the promise of previously unseen lore. But Augusta was focused on the canoness. ‘Milady, it was our honour to attend your service, though its litanies were unfamiliar. You will forgive our lack of knowledge in not responding – no insult was intended.’ ‘And none was taken, Sister Superior.’ The canoness gestured at her servitors, which were laying tiny, perfect plates upon the table, each one offering some sort of fungus-based pastries. With a quiet bow, the grey-hooded figures withdrew. ‘Now, you must tell me of your Order – I have seen such armour only in my books, and yet here it is, the colour of new blood. And you must tell me why He has brought you here, Sister, to my little convent, so long untouched by the Imperium’s… warriors.’ There was an odd stress on the word ‘warriors’, but this was an uncharted corner of the void in more ways than one. Navigating carefully, Augusta offered no correction of the term. Instead, she said, ‘We seek a ship, milady, crash-landed upon your world. It bears a sacred text that I am charged to retrieve.’ ‘A ship?’ The elderly lady put her head to one side, almost birdlike in fine-boned fragility. Her white hair, neatly bunned but loose tendrils still crackling with remembered electricity, gleamed in the hearth-light, and her skull outline seemed oddly prominent, for all its age. ‘Sister Superior, no ships come to this world, crashed or otherwise. He has decreed our isolation, and we are gladly alone, caretakers of this, His most holy cemetery.’ Lines round her eyes crinkled with affection or wariness. ‘Truly, we are the servants of His last and greatest blessing.’ Viola opened her mouth, realised the answer, shut it again. But the canoness’ perception was sharp. ‘Our release, my fire-haired Sister. Our blessed ascension to the Great Throne, where we may at last witness His suspension and His glory. Truly, there is no greater gift.’ Her words glittered, dark and ardent. ‘He is the ultimate expression of the faith of my Order. The visage of death.’ At the word, thunder grumbled, and the canoness turned away to gaze upon the storm. Alcina shifted, but Augusta flicked a hand, discreetly and by her hip. Over the tight-beam vox-link, she subvocalised, ‘We must tread carefully, Sister. This place unsettles me, and I do not know why.’ ‘I hear you.’ Alcina’s response was laden with tension. Akemi was still staring at the books, her head turning sideways to read their spines. ‘You are a scholar?’ The canoness addressed the youngest Sister, making her start and turn back. ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Mmm.’ The old woman studied Akemi’s shining black hair, her pale skin, the relative newness of her fleur-de-lys tattoo. Like the skulls, she seemed to be analysing what she saw. ‘There is much lore here,’ she said. ‘It has been gathered from many places upon this world. Like my Sisters of this Order, our frateris militia have little use for combat. In place of such training, they tend to the headstones and shrines, as is proper, while we perform His ancient rites here, in the Great Cathedral. Sometimes, they bring to us things for which we must care – books, particularly, are vulnerable to the storm.’ There was something in her tone, an edge, the faintest hint of some deep curiosity. Akemi responded, her voice respectfully even. ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness chuckled. ‘You are perfectly behaved, young one.’ She tapped thin, claw-like fingers against her cheek. ‘So, little scholar, you shall stay. You shall bless me with your lore and tell me of your Order. Explain to me your flower symbol. It is a rose, is it not?’ Akemi shot a glance at Augusta. ‘Surely, milady, the Sister Superior…?’ Again, the elderly canoness waved her hand. ‘I have already said’ – the phrase was faintly sharp, a warning of discipline – ‘that combat is of little use here. A chamber awaits you, Sister Superior, and a quiet supper will be served in the refectorium. You are welcome to join us, of course. You – Akemi, isn’t it? – you will stay.’ Brooking no argument, she turned back to the bookshelf, as if searching for something she wished to show Akemi. ‘Sister Superior?’ Akemi’s subvocalised voice came over the squad-vox, wary and requesting permission. Augusta repeated the warning she had given Alcina, then said, ‘She is canoness of her Order and we do not disobey. But speak little, Akemi, and listen to every word she offers. Ask questions, if you are permitted.’ Privately, she thanked His wisdom that the canoness had selected Akemi and not Viola. ‘We must locate our missing text. And this place perturbs me, for reasons I cannot yet fathom.’ The refectorium was a small and circular chamber, figures of saints standing about its edges, and every one with its face pared down to a skull. Some were familiar – Celestine herself was here – but there were others that Augusta did not know, perhaps representations from headstones that the frateris had found or tended. Viola fidgeted; Melia, too, seemed oddly unsettled and, after partaking of a quiet meal, the Sisters returned to their sleeping chamber still restless, their hunger satisfied but not their unease. Once their door was closed, Viola exploded with withheld tension. ‘That was no grace that I have ever heard! We offer Him thanks for our victuals, not repentance that we must live another–’ ‘Silence.’ Augusta’s response was soft, but brooked no argument. Over their private channel, she said, ‘Caia, I want a complete technical sweep of this chamber and its surrounding area, as far as your auspex can reach. And I want to know where we are in relation to the estimated crash site. Between ourselves, we will communicate only over the vox.’ ‘Very wise.’ Alcina’s tone was all warning. ‘There is much here that defies my comprehension. While each Order bears its own prayers and hymns, these Sisters behave in a way that is… unusual.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘We will await Akemi, and any insight she brings,’ Augusta said. ‘But yes, I agree. There is something deeply amiss about this place. His voice speaks in my heart, and I must listen to His warnings.’ ‘The canoness told us the Soul of Aeris didn’t crash,’ Viola agreed. ‘We know that the ship’s last communication was of the storm. And they won’t let me carry my weapon.’ The words had an edge, the source of her restlessness. ‘Not only that,’ Melia said, her tone dark. ‘But the young Sister who perished – she was barely in her twenties, and in full health. I consider it unlikely that she perished from cardiac failure, as we have been told…’ Melia was trained by the Order of Serenity, and the squad’s medicae. She gave a twitch of a shrug, and her pauldron clattered. ‘The canoness seems learned, she must know this. Which would mean that she has uttered an open falsehood, before Him, in a sermon of holy worship. This is more than “unusual”, Sisters.’ There was a twist of horror to her words. ‘This is unthinkable.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘The crash site is approximately seven miles south-south-east of here.’ Caia lowered her auspex, its green wash of light fading. ‘With the density of the storm it is plausible that the descent of the ship went unnoticed. I can tell little more from here.’ ‘And are we being observed?’ ‘Not by machine-spirits.’ ‘There are ways, and ways.’ The comment was a thought, voiced over the vox. Aloud, the Sister Superior said, ‘Come, sing with me, my Sisters. Let us celebrate our finding of this Order, so newly joined to the Adepta Sororitas. We will raise our voices in His glory, and sing our requiem for Sister Clara. Sister Alcina, if you would.’ Alcina’s voice was a deep, full contralto; it rolled almost like the storm. It also allowed Augusta to listen. Not with the vox, but with her ears. And, as the other Sisters joined the hymnal, their harmonies as clean as the cathedral’s service had been eerie, she knew. She had heard these acoustics before. The convent may not have the technology to overhear, but every word the Sisters said was echoing back through the old, stone passages, and – she would have to assume – directly to the ears of the canoness. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said, when she returned. Like the others, she kept her words over the vox. ‘I was able to glean little. I told her of the younger Orders, of Deacis VI and of the Bloody and the Sacred Rose. Of our most holy saints Mina and Arabella. But she offered little in return. She did repeat, however, that she does not believe that the Aeris crashed here. Until our arrival, they had not seen a single Imperial vessel, of any size or description, in possibly millennia.’ ‘Millennia.’ Her armour off, laid out upon its sacred mat, Augusta knelt in her under-armour, the rose-red gambeson that helped to absorb incoming blows. The squad’s briefing had been very specific – they were to find the fallen ship, and the text that it had carried. And it was not just the Aeris. As the Sisters had crossed the vast steams of the empyrean, approaching this tiny corner of space, so Augusta had taken breaks from her squad’s training to learn as much as she could about Letum and its ceaseless storm. ‘We know,’ she said, ‘that the Aeris is not the only lost ship. Merchants’ vessels have gone missing near here, though nothing large or significant. Individually, they are unnoticeable, tiny cogs in a huge machine. But, if you put enough cogs together…’ She stopped, thinking. What she was about to suggest was, at best, a lack of protocol, at worst, downright blasphemous, but His calling in her heart was strong. As strong as it had been on Lycheate, with the doomed, crazed Inquisitor Istrix – she knew that something was wrong. In her mind, she saw the image-flash of the cathedral window, the lightning casting His image upon the stone. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, I am going to do something… unwise.’ Alcina raised a faintly acerbic eyebrow, but said nothing. ‘I will do this alone, take full responsibility for my actions. If questioned, you were following my orders.’ ‘You’re not going out there,’ Caia said, ever-perceptive. ‘The force of the storm–’ ‘That is not your decision to make, Sister,’ she answered, with a warning eyebrow. ‘I will not take my armour, it will make far too much noise. I will take my bolter, however, though only as a precaution. The canoness was right about one thing – there is no need for combat. Whatever else this place may be, it is a place of peace.’ Too much peace, I suspect. ‘Sister Superior.’ Alcina turned, squaring her shoulders. Already understanding her second’s disapproving expression, Augusta only nodded. ‘I hear you, Sister, and you are not wrong. But we have a mission, and we must succeed in that mission. And there are times when that mission is not about a war.’ A flicker of a smile. ‘Though I confess, that unsettles me just as much as the atmosphere of this convent.’ The smile faded again. ‘By His grace and blessing, we have come through the storm. He landed us safely for a reason.’ Viola fidgeted, but said nothing. Akemi said, ‘Let me come with you, Sister. I can be quiet, and I may… I may be able to read the gravestones’ ancient symbols, where you cannot.’ Augusta gave the youngest Sister a long look, then nodded. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, we will stay in vox-contact. I will recite the opening words of the Treatise, every fifteen minutes, beginning at the hour of Evensong. If I do not…’ Her smile turned mirthless. ‘Then don your wargear, in His name, and seek answers of the canoness. If she gives none, then you head for the crash site and complete the mission.’ ‘I strongly advise against this, Sister,’ Alcina said, sternly disapproving. ‘We should head for that crash site now–’ ‘Objection noted,’ Augusta said. ‘Akemi?’ The youngest Sister, slight out of her armour but wrought from steel wire, inhaled like she was bracing herself. ‘Yes, Sister Superior. And may He bless our explorations.’ May He bless our explorations. The convent was quiet, its cloisters open to the storm and charged with the electricity in the air. The hairs on Augusta’s forearms were standing on end and her skin prickled with it, as if covered in crawlers. From the cathedral transept, there came a twining of Evensong voices – another eerie, minor-key harmony. Akemi walked silently, her small face creased in a frown. Skulls in the cloisters’ carved ceilings leered toothily as they passed. ‘What bothers you, Sister?’ Augusta’s voice was barely a whisper, sounding in Akemi’s vox-bead. ‘Forgive me, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘I am thinking. We, alone, of possibly hundreds of ships, have been able to land here, our pilot blessed by Him to bring us safely through the storm. Yet the canoness has said this world is isolated by His design. I cannot resolve these two things. Has He brought us here? Or are we unwelcome, in defiance of His wishes?’ ‘Have faith, Akemi,’ Augusta answered, her confidence complete. ‘The loss of the Aeris, and the text she bears – this was His way to guide us to this world, and to our lost Sisters. Whatever takes place, He has brought us here to see it.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Akemi said nothing more, and they kept walking. The cloisters were a large quadrangle, surrounding a flagstoned square with a great and many-layered fountain at its centre. Rainwater chuckled, overspilling the fountain’s edges. Side doors offered storage chambers: places where the attending frateris would care for the life of the cathedral, its kneeling mats, censers and hymn books. Another door led to the sacristy, where the Sisters’ grey robes could be stored. Carefully, Augusta pushed at it, but it was locked. From the transept, Evensong rose to its crescendo, shivering outwards across the storm. Lightning flashed, though not closely; the thunder was a distance away. Soon, they reached the cloisters’ outermost corner and paused. An arched and open doorway offered a short flight of stone steps and a gravel path that curved onwards through the building’s closest graveyard. The rain had thinned to a gentle, drifting mist, and upright lumens offered cold white pools of illumination. Thunder grumbled, distant now. Everything lurked ghostlike, fogged and monochrome. Waiting. Augusta began to wish she’d brought her armour, noisy though it was. It was so much a part of her, of her faith and capability, that she felt acutely vulnerable without it. ‘What are we looking for, Sister?’ Akemi asked her. ‘Answers,’ Augusta said. ‘There is more to this than a downed ship.’ Out across the pale light, there were shifting, grey-clad shapes, almost unseen – the frateris, tending the stones even at this late hour. In the mist, they looked like phantoms. ‘This way.’ Very conscious of her scarlet padding, Augusta moved along the side of the building, circling it carefully. Akemi followed, looking at the gravestones, some of them embedded in the wall. As they reached the back of the building, and began a slightly wider circle, Akemi stopped. ‘Sister,’ she said. Instantly, the Sister Superior froze. ‘What?’ ‘This stone’s been moved.’ ‘It is surely the stone of Sister Clara? ‘Not here, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Clara’s ashes will be interred in the Sisters’ own sarcophagus, the canoness did tell me that much. This…’ She sounded puzzled. ‘This is something else.’ ‘Explain.’ Drawing a breath, Akemi answered. ‘The canoness’ books are almost all in High Gothic. It’s a very old form, with some linguistic variations, but it’s essentially familiar. And it ties in with her claim that the frateris have retrieved them from the graves, in order to preserve them. But that…’ She nodded at the stone. It had three oddly shaped skulls engraved in its top, a prayer inscribed beneath. ‘That’s older. Much older. That stone is significantly older than the cathedral itself.’ Augusta shot the youngest Sister a sharp look. ‘So it’s been placed here since?’ Akemi nodded, her thoughts coalescing as she spoke. ‘It must have been brought here from somewhere else, laid into the wall when the cathedral was built. And that, in turn, would imply that something has been here–’ ‘For longer than the Sisters.’ Augusta considered this, nodding. ‘I–’ ‘Sister Superior.’ Startled, Augusta turned. She was unsettled indeed if anyone could come this close, unheard and undetected. Instinctively, her hand had gone for her bolter, but she drew it back – this was one of the frateris, a grey-cloaked figure, his hood back. His face was young and lean, and etched with shadows from the overhead lumens. ‘Yes?’ Arching an austere eyebrow, she offered no apology or explanation. ‘It is late, Sisters.’ The man’s tone was chillingly polite. ‘The canoness has asked us to ensure your welfare, and you should be resting before Nightfall prayers.’ His eyes were dark sockets, as skull-like as everything else in that place. ‘She will be expecting you.’ He leaned on the word, just enough. ‘And we will attend, of course,’ Augusta answered him, her authority smooth and unchallenged. ‘But perhaps, since you are here, you can answer a question.’ ‘Forgive me, Sister,’ the young man said, as smoothly polished as the canoness’ tabletop. ‘This is hardly the place for questions. You are guests of the convent. And you should be attending milady canoness.’ There was a warning in his tone, a blade sheathed but ready. And while his words were carefully chosen, his behaviour was verging on arrogant. ‘He’s hiding something,’ Akemi said, over the vox. ‘I agree,’ Augusta answered her. ‘But what?’ The Sister Superior returned to the chamber with few answers, only more questions. Remaining within, she and the squad observed the Nightfall prayer by themselves, offering their words to His sacred effigy that had come with them from Ophelia VII. The Sister Superior prayed for divine guidance – not the usual litany, but with words that came from her heart. The image from the cathedral window had stayed with her, as if flash-etched onto her retinae. She had distinct suspicions – graveyard world, older culture – such things were ­inevitable. But without tangible proof, she could hardly make accusations. Why was that headstone in the cathedral wall? Where had it come from? And why had she seen only younger faces? Aside from the old lady, every Sister, every servitor, every member of the frateris militia had been under thirty – significantly younger than Augusta herself. The thought came with smoke-curls of sinister possibilities, coiling like the life of Sister Clara. The Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. There was only one way to find an answer. In the morning, after the dawn prayer, the squad donned full armour and attended, as was proper, the canoness’ wishes. The old lady was as polite as ever, saying nothing about the previous evening’s excursion. Augusta wasn’t sure if that was simply due to decorum, or because she genuinely didn’t know. Had the frateris not told her? Such a lack of discipline and respect – that was unheard of. Just who was lying to whom? ‘With your permission, milady,’ she said. ‘We must seek the Aeris.’ Answering the canoness’ query about their mission, Augusta fully intended to get to the bottom of this. ‘I have her approximate coordinates and my mission directive is very clear. If the ship’s resting place is here, then He will guide us to its side.’ ‘Of course,’ the old lady said. ‘Victuals have been prepared for you. I do not believe the ship is here, but you must undertake your mission. Go, with His blessing.’ Her permission was confusing. Viola, much happier now her heavy bolter had been returned, commented darkly as they headed out, ‘Did she not deny that the ship was here? Then why grant us permission to seek its location? She says one thing and then she says another. We should confront her.’ ‘I agree,’ Alcina said. ‘I do not like this… sneaking.’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia disagreed. ‘Her words were sincere. She endeavours only to help, to facilitate our mission.’ She looked round at her Sisters, her red helm glistening with rain. ‘I do not doubt her faith.’ ‘This place is rotten,’ Viola muttered. ‘It stinks.’ Despite the filters in the Sisters’ armour, smells of death lingered, of bones and dust. The place seemed old, serenely quiet, its headstones pulled down by reaching creepers, its occasional dark trees all swarmed with ivy. Thunder still grumbled, but remained a distance away. Following Caia’s auspex, they wound their way through the endless criss-cross of sunken walkways. Akemi watched both sides, her head turning back and forth like a lighthouse; Melia carried the rations that the servitors had prepared for them. Alcina walked at the rear, still sternly disapproving of Augusta’s choices. But without proof, Augusta could say nothing. ‘There,’ Caia said. The green glare of the auspex shone out through thin, ever-clouded morning light. ‘Over the rise.’ Beneath the storm, the Aeris lay dead, her hard, angular shape silhouetted by the thunderous sky. She was an exploratory-class vessel, small compared to the frigates and destroyers of the Imperial Navy, and she lay broken on her side, half buried in blackened soil and shattered headstones. Her nose was completely covered, her adamantine plating charred by lightning and extreme heat; the Sisters could see the huge, miles-long burn-scar, crashing through walls and statues, that her death had ripped in the ground. ‘Hold.’ At Augusta’s order, the Sisters dropped at the lip of the ridge. They lay on their bellies, looking over at the downed ship. Caia’s auspex flickered green: movement. Only a dozen blips, but enough. ‘They cannot be crew?’ Melia said, puzzled. ‘It has taken us four months to reach this planet,’ Augusta answered. ‘Any survivors would already have been found by the convent.’ ‘Unless they chose to hide,’ Akemi suggested. Viola muttered, ‘Then why are they moving now?’ For a moment, the scent of Sister Clara’s burning coffin seemed to hang in the air. Dismissing whimsy, Augusta raised her magnoculars, and took a closer look. Immediately, she lowered them, blinking, and passed them to Sister Alcina. ‘Tell me what you see, Sister.’ Frowning, Alcina took her turn. ‘No survivors,’ she said. ‘The saviour pods were never even launched. I suspect the storm slew the ship’s machine-spirit and the Aeris never had a chance – she crashed powerless. It is unlikely the crew survived. And I see…’ She reared back, blinked exactly like Augusta had done, looked once again through the magnoculars. ‘By the Throne. Truly, Sister Superior, He has brought us here for a deeper purpose.’ ‘What?’ Viola, her shoulder against the heavy bolter, almost crackled with impatience. Augusta nodded. ‘We have our answers, Sisters,’ she said. ‘The frateris are stripping salvage from the ship. And my heart tells me this is not for the canoness’ use. ‘Move!’ The bark was soft; the Sisters skirmished, and fast. While the frateris were neither armed nor armoured, Augusta still held to her lingering suspicion that there was another power at work here. Something else, something older. Something that had built headstones, long before the founding of the cathedral. And something that, during the Imperium’s absence, had seeped slowly back to the surface. Something xenos. Three of the Sisters ran forwards, dropped behind graves and statues, then offered cover while the other three ran – the movements were instinctive, perfectly executed, smooth as gun oil. Caia, silent and on point, indicated with one arm and the squad bore left, passing the nose of the downed ship, and holding to the heavy, cold undershadow of its huge and looming belly. Carefully, slowing down now, they approached a shattered wall. And beneath it, a yawning, stone-lined void, black as betrayal, and half collapsed by the ship’s corpse. Voices became audible, echoing from burn-scarred metal. ‘Don’t drop it, you damned oaf. Take it to the entrance, put it on the pile.’ Grumbles and grunts followed. Whatever the cargo, it was heavy. Augusta half expected the whine of a loader, but there was nothing. ‘And you!’ The voice was familiar. ‘Stop dawdling!’ Akemi said, her voice a whisper, ‘That’s–’ ‘Last night’s challenger.’ The Sister Superior couldn’t muster surprise ‘Of course it is.’ She controlled a need to curse – suddenly, this was all fitting together. Over the vox, she said, ‘Viola, with me. The rest of you, stay and cover. Alcina, eyes and ears open. Caia, I want locations on everything moving. And find me that text!’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola and the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her shoulder, Augusta rose from her cover, and issued a flat command. ‘You.’ The word was a bark, aimed at the man who had spoken. ‘This is an Imperial vessel, under examination by the Adepta Sororitas. Put down your cargo, lie belly down on the floor.’ Figures turned, glanced at each other, wondered what was going on. ‘Now.’ No one moved. They stared at the red-armoured figures of the Sisters. Augusta said, ‘Three… two… one…’ As the countdown reached zero, she shot the closest figure, straight through the chest. The detonation was echoing-loud; scarlet exploded across ground and stone and the ship’s underside. Still, the figures did not move. Viola hefted the heavy bolter, waiting for the order. ‘Sister Superior,’ the man said, amused and exasperated. He was indeed the same figure that they’d seen the previous night, cadaverous and austere, despite his youth. ‘I told you – you should be at prayers, attending the canoness. I was intending to retrieve your relic for you. Before you… came looking.’ Despite the death of his fellow, he had a flat absence of either surprise or fear. And there was an implication to his phrase that she didn’t quite follow. Using her preysight, she scanned him for weapons, found none, but still, she did not dismiss the threat. His confidence was bothering her – what didn’t she know? She walked forwards, focused on the speaker. Viola walked with her, focused everywhere else. ‘Move away from the ship.’ ‘Please, Sister.’ The man spread his hands, smiling. ‘This is not your concern.’ Bolter in the other hand, Augusta grabbed him by a fistful of grey shirt, slammed his back against the blood-spattered corpse of the Aeris. ‘You are frateris militia, and you do not speak to me, or to any Sister, with such lack of respect. Your life belongs to Him, and to the convent. You are sworn to His service.’ She made an assumption, ran with it. ‘Why do you lie to your canoness?’ What are you hiding? The man narrowed his gaze, but still showed no fear. His glance flicked past her shoulder, and she became aware that the rest of the squad was moving, closing up the distance to the ship. From the corner of her eye, she saw Caia gesturing direction – they were looking for the text. She said, ‘You are a heretic–’ ‘Then kill me.’ His grin was confident, now verging on crazed. ‘I do not fear His blessing.’ His eyes shone. ‘But I do His work, Sister, as do we all. Should I rise to His glory, another will take my place, and another, and another. I offer their youth, their lives, to Him. And He rewards me – us – well!’ ‘You slew Sister Clara.’ It was a rush of horror, a cold hand of realisation. ‘You slay all of them.’ ‘I grant them His blessing.’ His rictus grin was suitably skull-like. ‘This is Letum, it has always been this way. They wish the Throne, and we grant them their release. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much.’ ‘What knowledge?’ The man laughed, the noise dark and rich. ‘It is our secret, forbidden, not to be shared. Not even with you.’ ‘Or with the convent.’ The horror was crawling over Augusta’s skin now, writhing like the strands of creeper. ‘You murder them, and they do not even know why.’ ‘Murder?’ His grin faltered; he seemed genuinely confused. ‘We bless them, Sister. There is a plant here, grown with His blessing. A little in the food, that’s all it takes – and a heart fails.’ His sincerity was startling. ‘This is Letum. And this is His word, His way, His calling, His grace–’ ‘He’s crazed.’ Viola was starting to twitch – her need to open fire was tangible. Augusta, too, could feel her horror fusing to fury, that welcome rise of red rage that was His touch, showing her the way. But not yet. There was a thread to the man’s glee that she had yet to understand. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much. ‘Caia.’ Over the vox. ‘Report.’ ‘The ship’s been stripped,’ Caia returned. ‘Panels, wires, metalwork, everything. It’s a skeleton, there’s almost nothing left. Whatever they’re doing, it’s been going on for months.’ ‘I hear you.’ Augusta jammed her bolter, hard, under the man’s throat. ‘Where are you taking it?’ ‘I told you, that knowledge is forbidden.’ The man’s grin grew wider, his eyes flared. ‘He has spoken to me, in visions. He has decreed my path!’ ‘You utter both falsehood and blasphemy.’ She was really angry now. ‘You are a betrayer, faithless, and you presume to take His name?’ ‘I utter no falsehood, Sister. I hold faith, always. He has spoken to me, to all of us. He has sent us visions, taught us how to obey His creed. We believe in Him, we have held to His faith for generations.’ There was an honest plea in his voice. Viola, her voice dark with blood, said, ‘All those ships, Sister, those missing merchants’ vessels. Whatever this is, it’s larger than just the Aeris.’ ‘I agree,’ Augusta said. Thinking for a minute, she gave the squad the order to regroup on her location. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We will secure these… cultists’ – she refused to give them their title – ‘and follow the trail of their ported cargo. Let us pray, my Sisters, that He will take us to the end of this puzzle.’ Sister Caia had not yet managed to locate the sacred text, but Augusta would return to the main task of her mission once this matter was resolved. A brief scout showed a side chamber in the stone maw, a place where more cargo was piled. Carrying His authority and with the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her back, the Sister Superior commanded the frateris to amass within, and left Sister Alcina as their guard. Augusta had no wish to seek a potential foe with reduced strength, but these faithless heretics would face the justice of their Order’s canoness, the one they had betrayed. And Alcina’s sheer presence was enough to ensure their behaviour. The remaining five of the squad ducked into the hole. Following the stamped-down trail of bootsteps, they headed deep, deep beneath the gravestones. Swiftly, they left the thin, stormy daylight behind them and vanished into swallowing black. They turned on their suit lights, angled beams of illumination that picked out multiple layers, like rock strata, compressed into the walls. But the stripes were not rock. Letum had been a cemetery planet for millennia, and only its uppermost graves were still on the surface. These left trailing roots, ends of bone, fragments of grave goods, pieces of coffins. As the Sisters moved deeper, still following the stamped hard-route and the occasional dropped corroded brass cog, they found coffins in layers, like geological ages – pieces of older headstones, fragments of dead technology. Slices of stone ran round the walls, and before much longer, these began to spread out through the soil, opening to a smooth throat that was bitterly, shiveringly cold. Sealed in her armour, Augusta checked her temperature read-out and gestured for the five of them to slow down. Caia, still on point and still using her auspex, shook her head: no motion. But the Sister Superior knew they were coming to the heart of this. And that too-smooth stone was chillingly familiar. Walk with us, O Emperor. Bear your light to guide our bootsteps… With a prayer over the vox, they crept forwards, suit lights slanting through the pitch-dark. Akemi paused at a series of symbols, too ancient to even bear mould, but Augusta already knew what they were. She had seen them before. And they confirmed her suspicions. What else would hide this deep beneath the gravestones, teaching its cult of death? She paused, though she could not read the lettering. ‘It seems the frateris have been weak,’ she said. ‘They have betrayed their faith, fallen victim to something that yet lurks down here.’ Her voice was bleak. ‘It calls to them. And they listen.’ Viola hefted the heavy bolter. ‘It’s not going to call for much longer.’ The Sister Superior did not permit herself a chuckle. They moved on, deeper and colder, careful with every step. And then: blip. Only the one, and stationary. Ahead of them. ‘Close up formation. Viola, on point. Melia, take the rear.’ Over the vox, Augusta started to sing the battle litany, heard her Sisters join her, their harmonies clean and strong. The words were not spoken aloud, not down here, but they were familiar, His presence carried with them even into the darkest depths of this xenos-polluted world. We will remove the taint, she thought. Free our Sisters from this heretic grip! And then, they reached the mouth of the tunnel. And saw light. The light was green, taint and unholiness, and it flooded from a vast and upright gemstone in the centre of the room. The stone had no support – it turned slowly, floating free of a symbol-carved floor, concentric circles that pulled all eyes towards its central, gelid might. The walls, too, were etched in cyphers, studded with skulls, many of them encrusted with gems in their turn. Each one glittered like the eyes of the skulls in the cathedral. Watching. But that was not what made the Sisters pause. About the vast stone, shadows moved, hundreds, thousands of them – every one a piece of scavenged technology. From the Aeris, from the dozens, even hundreds of ships that had hove too close to the storm, and then crashed here, they now orbited the stone’s light slowly, like some drifting, asteroid eclipse, some floating of fragmented night. ‘Viola.’ Augusta did not hesitate. The younger Sister aimed the heavy bolter. Caia said, ‘Wait!’ Another blip, and another, and another. Augusta drew her chainsword, though she did not start the mechanism. Descending from the huge dome of the roof came shapes. Not more skulls, but three elongated, oddly insectoid figures with metallic and curling tails, and a multitude of eager, gleaming claws. They glowed with the same green light, and Augusta’s suspicions were confirmed. Necrons. Of course. She had time for one shout: ‘Don’t let them close!’ And then the Sisters were moving as one, shoulder to shoulder, all of them facing outwards. Roaring the words of the battle prayer, Viola opened fire. The noise was deafening. A full suppression exploded across the room; rounds tore upwards, targeting the descending figures. One monster was caught and sent spinning, another was buffeted physically backwards by the force of the attack. Wounds erupted across its body, spraying dark splashes of oil. It crashed against the wall and fell, crumpled. It didn’t move again. ‘In His name!’ There was the ring of victory in Viola’s voice. But the other two were still moving, and there were more blips incoming. Even as the Sisters opened fire, the things flickered and shifted, and the rounds went straight through them, striking sparks and debris from the walls and roof. ‘What–’ Akemi cut off the curse and kept shooting. ‘They phase!’ Augusta remembered all too well the world of Heqet, and the last time she’d seen a necron wraith. ‘Time your shooting!’ Viola turned the heavy bolter on the second figure, but it had already faded away. ‘We’ve got more of them,’ Caia said. ‘Dominica’s eyes.’ The auspex was alive with motion. ‘Move!’ Augusta bellowed. ‘To the tunnel mouth. Melia, we need the flamer!’ They moved, Viola covering. The younger Sister checked back over her shoulder, fell back as Melia came to the fore. And just in time, as a stream of clicking silver came pouring down the walls, scuttling even over the gemstone itself. Augusta had seen necron scarabs reduce a human to nothing in less than a second, take entire squads to pieces, armour and all. But Melia stood firm, framed by the green light of the tunnel mouth, her armour flaring scarlet at its edges. Watching the seethe, she waited. Augusta held her breath, trusting to her Sister’s experience. Then, with a cry of prayer, Melia loosed the full force of the flamer. Scarabs screeched like tortured metal, shattered with superheat. They crisped and turned over, curling up their legs. Keeping the flamer spraying, she moved it back and forth over the room’s floor, then up the walls towards the ceiling. Thick smoke filled the air, stinking. The creatures sparked and crackled. Then, without warning, Melia fell. One of the wraiths had reappeared, its claws embedded in her armour. Even as Augusta moved to shoot it, it was gone again, leaving Melia crumpled on the floor. The last of the scarabs headed instantly for her, clicking as they came. Caia, howling a prayer of her own, moved forwards to stamp on them. The words of the battle litany came from her in sheer, boiling fury. Sister Melia did not move. Augusta, eyes everywhere, searched the main chamber. ‘If there are wraiths, she said. ‘There’s likely to be a spider.’ She grinned, though the others could not see it. ‘Let’s coax it out, shall we? Viola, hit the phylactery.’ Raising the heavy bolter, Sister Viola blew the gemstone away. In the librarium, the canoness looked at the Sisters. The squad were battered and filthy, their armour damaged by the claws of the wraiths, by the insistent scuttle of the devouring scarabs. Melia was walking, though carefully; Alcina eyed the five of them with the faintest air of irritation, as if she had wanted to be in at the fighting. But she had brought the faithless frateris back with her, and their leader now stood before his canoness, his head up, his eyes blazing. There was no repentance in him, only a savage and eager joy. The rest of them had been placed in the convent’s crypts. For now. ‘Xenos, you say.’ Elderly though the canoness was, her voice still carried an edge, the true, righteous wrath of a Sister of Battle. ‘And their pollution rife amongst my people.’ Her gaze turned to the man, but he met it fearlessly, welcomed it. ‘I have done nothing wrong,’ he said. ‘Only embraced Him! His greatest gift!’ Swift as a thought, the canoness backhanded him. ‘How dare you?’ Her voice was livid with outrage. ‘Your blasphemy! Your betrayal!’ She was physically shaking, quivering with the kind of anger that should blister the skin of his face. ‘The Sisters of this Order that you have manipulated to their deaths!’ With a thump, she brought one hand down on the table, making her effigies and candles jump. ‘You have made a mockery of our very faith.’ The man said, again, ‘I have done nothing wrong! The great gem – it needs energy. Needed ships, supplies, power! Needs to build its forces once more! And it was His voice, His voice!’ The man staggered suddenly to his knees, reached for the hem of the canoness’ grey robe. ‘He spoke to me, milady. He came to me in a vision. A vision of death, and of pure, green light!’ The canoness stared down at him, pitiless. ‘And every time a Sister grew too close, it told you to end her life,’ Augusta said, her tone pure steel. ‘To make of her a sacrifice.’ ‘He spoke to me.’ The man, pleading now, looked from canoness to Sister Superior. ‘He wanted only to help them. He spoke to my father, to my mother, to their parents before them. He–’ ‘Enough.’ The canoness snatched her robe from the man’s grasp, swept it back to herself with a gesture that was all imperious scorn. ‘You have allied yourselves with a xenos power,’ Augusta said, grimly. ‘Caused the deaths of unknown numbers of His faithful. Your life is forfeit–’ ‘Wait,’ the canoness said. ‘Milady?’ ‘I have already said.’ The old lady sounded sad, now, her long years weighing heavy, but her eyes were like chips of flint. ‘We are not warriors, not like yourselves. We do His work, tending to those who have gone before us. But that work is not the work of warfare, it is the work of peace. Of His peace. Of that final peace that is granted in death, and in repose.’ She was staring at the frateris, who had a slow, horrific realisation breaking across his face. ‘I will not grant you that peace, heretic.’ Around Augusta, the squad shifted, understanding. ‘No…’ said the man. Abruptly, the canoness lost her temper. ‘You have made a lie of our very Order! You have taken the tenets of this convent, of its most holy teachings, and you have twisted them, offering them to a xenos power! You have betrayed everything that He means to us, to this world of the sacred dead!’ Now the man was cowering, sobs starting in his chest. His love for the old lady was honest; the shattering of his own lies almost too much to bear. He said, ‘But I had a vision… I was only bringing His blessing…’ ‘Your vision was falsehood,’ Augusta told him, still hard as rock. ‘You are no longer frateris. You are nothing.’ ‘You are nothing,’ the canoness agreed. ‘You will join your fellows in the crypt. And there you will stay. Until your shouts weaken, and your hunger and thirst grow unbearable. Until you find repentance in your heart. And I pray that when you do face Him, you will know your faithlessness and understand humility. In that way, your soul may yet be saved.’ Alcina was nodding, sternly approving. Melia had frowned, but said nothing. ‘And you, milady?’ Augusta asked. ‘What will you do, without your frateris?’ ‘Penance, Sister Superior,’ the canoness responded. ‘We allowed our faith to falter, to be corrupted by this ancient, xenos taint, and we did nothing. We allowed our young Sisters to be tricked to their deaths, and we did nothing. We only celebrated their ascension, knowing not what had caused it. We will offer our own labours in repentance. We will leave this closeted building, as we should have done long ago, and we will tend to the graves ourselves.’ She stopped, thinking for a minute, then finished, ‘I understand you have not yet found your text?’ Comprehending more than the question, Augusta responded, ‘No, milady, we have not. And it would be our honour to stay, even after our mission is completed.’ She looked round at the rest of the squad. ‘This world may yet have foes lurking beneath its surface. They must be sought out, and summarily slain.’ With the faintest flicker of a smile, the canoness nodded. ‘Then perhaps,’ she said, ‘we do have need for warriors, after all.’",

      "content": "Lance-Corporal Gideon Mase had a lho-stick, a packet of rations, and a mess tin of recaff. Well, not ‘recaff’ exactly. They’d mixed it with something, and it tasted like boiled mud… but that was what the quartermaster issued, and moaning was heresy. Mase’s little hexi-stove was still burning, a tiny blue flame like some miniature beacon, and he’d sat his weary arse down on the boot-pounded dirt beside it. Broken buildings towered all around him, many of them heaped into makeshift defences, but here, the ground was flat. He took a long drag on the stick, and blew out a plume of grey. It was late, and finally quiet, thank the Emperor. The sky was dark, and drifting, settling clouds of soot and stone dust were everywhere, getting in his eyes, his mouth, his hair, his kit. He took another drag on the stick, and coughed up black gunk. ‘Nice.’ His squadmate Kewa nudged him with a battered, camo-covered elbow. She was a small, wiry thing, her eyes tired, her face dirty. Like him, she had the rich, purple-black skin of Uvodia III, and her hair, once shorn and dark, now more resembled the tangled filth of Kiros. And of this endless bloody war. His recaff was too hot, and he scalded himself on the metal. ‘Shit!’ The 16th Gavera, known to themselves as the ‘Jags’, had been here on Kiros for almost a Solar year, fighting back and forth, and back and forth; a grinding, endless tedium that never seemed to change. The foe attacked, slobbering forwards, screaming and shrieking; the Jags skirmished out and drove them back. They were an infantry company, stationed on the outermost edge of what had been Kiros’ capital city, and way too bloody far from home. It defied Mase’s understanding: Kiros had no value. It had been an Administratum world, a world of hab-blocks and endless, featureless dormitories of cubicles and tiny offices, their grubby walls inscribed with bureaucratic mottos about the holiness of diligence. Great cathedrals had spiked free from its regulation skyline, along with massive statues and cloud-scraping bell towers that rang the sacred hours of far-distant Holy Terra. Mase’s briefing hadn’t included specifics, but as far as he knew, they were the only things notable about this backwater world. There was nothing here even worth fighting over. At least, not until… He stopped, glanced round, and coughed again. A second lungful of muck spattered his chin. ‘D’you think it’s real?’ he muttered, half under his breath. ‘The holy text, I mean?’ ‘Watch it,’ Kewa told him, grinning. ‘You know we’re not supposed to speculate.’ ‘They were talking in the officers’ mess,’ he said. ‘About some new horror from the warp. It’s here to claim it first – or destroy it.’ Wiping his mouth on the end of his sleeve, he scowled and looked furtive. The platoons had driven back the afternoon’s assault and were now on downtime. Many had already started on bivvies and bedrolls, slinging their ponchos from the remains of the walls, or just wrapping themselves up and going straight to sleep. The metal leg of a patrolling Sentinel caught the faint reflection of the platoon HQ lumen; a distance ahead of him, he could make out the floodlights and field emitters that defended the front line. Mase leaned in, lowering his voice further. ‘I think that’s why they’re here,’ he said. ‘To face it.’ ‘You think they can?’ Kewa asked him. In the tiny light from the hexi-stove, her dark eyes shone. ‘I saw them, earlier today. They were at the centre of the line, right in front of the cath­edral where the plinth is. Fighting like nothing I’ve ever seen. And they’re no bigger than we are, not really.’ Mase was still watching round them. He hissed at her to lower her voice, then said, ‘I thought they’d be huge. Like Space Marines.’ ‘Nah.’ Kewa grinned, winked. ‘I saw one of them, once, too. Did I tell you that? On Aldana, just standing there, like some…’ She shrugged. ‘Colossus. He didn’t move or anything…’ She tailed off as the sergeant came into view. The man still wore his webbing, flak and helmet, but his rifle was slung. ‘You two all right?’ he asked them. His dark skin was filthy, his stone-coloured camo-paint lost under layers of soot. ‘Mase? Kewa? Injuries? Kit failures?’ ‘Can we go home, yet, sarge?’ Kewa asked. ‘Ask the commissar.’ The sergeant gave them both a sarcastic look, and strode off to the next group. She snickered, then lowered her voice once more. ‘They were amazing, Mase. I saw them, cutting their way through literally swathes of monsters. Dozens, hundreds of them. It was incred­ible. And they sing. It’s enough to make your hair stand on end. Watching them…’ She shivered. ‘It was like watching some perfectly blessed war machine.’ ‘You’re jealous,’ Mase realised, grinning. ‘Yeah, maybe a bit.’ Her expression turned rueful, and she shrugged. ‘What must that be like?’ She was looking out across the site now, past the gleam of a waiting tank. ‘That kind of kit, that kind of skill? Do you think the Emperor really speaks to them? Do they get scared, feel pain, the same way that we do?’ She stopped, staring at the semi-darkness. Ends of lho-sticks gleamed, and the occasional hexi-fire. Conversation and hints of weary laughter floated out across the evening wind. ‘You just said they were human,’ Mase told her. ‘I’d been told they were eight feet tall and bit the heads off heretics.’ She snorted. ‘They aren’t like Space Marines. The Sisters of Battle are like… I don’t know… Like watching faith fighting, like holiness incarnate…’ She tailed off, watching the sergeant as he came back into view. He passed them, going the other way, and she turned back to her dumped webbing, rummaging through it. Mase could see the frown on her face, like there was something she wasn’t saying. He didn’t press, it wasn’t his business. Instead, he blew steam and soot off his recaff and wondered if it was cool enough to drink. The Adepta Sororitas, the Sisters of Battle. Here. Speculation had been forbidden but still, his curiosity burned like the hexi. They had come to end the war, said some. To find this holy text, to deny and slay this great beast – whatever it was. To purge the taint from this world, to rebuild its churches and cathedrals, all the way back to its filth-choked sky… Despite the officers’ command, stories had flared through the troops like spreading fires. Conjecture had been rife, percussion shocks of expanding whispers… though if the sergeant heard you muttering, you were likely to get the toe of their boot. But – so many tales! Tales of a hundred battles, a thousand legends! Truly, the Jags were blessed, they and Kiros both. Kewa had found her own hexi and was opening it out, reaching for its block-fuel. His recaff still too hot, Mase took another drag on the lho-stick. He’d heard the stories, of course he had. The Sisters had their own procession, fearsome and wondrous, an icon at the heart of the battle. There were six of them, their armour black, and they bore the very saint herself, the bones of Holy Katherine. A flock of cherubim circled them like a moving halo, bearing prayer-banners and other things, things Mase did not know. And the darkness… they said that the darkness, the very clouds, fled before them like a thing defeated, like a receding tide. Where the Sisters strode, they carried His light, the light of Sol and of Terra, and the foe cowered… The thought made his heart race and his breath catch – surely, now, the end of this war must be in sight? The long-beleaguered Jags had a sharp point to their blunt hammer, the strength of blade, bolter and holy benediction– He caught himself, calmed his thoughts. Kewa’s irreverence was known – it had got her in trouble before – but they both needed to watch themselves. He saw all your thoughts, after all, every last flicker. Perhaps, Mase thought, the Sisters could see them, too. The idea made him shiver. His lho-stick burned his fingers and he swore, flicking its end in the hexi. Beside him, Kewa was cooking her ration pack, soot and all. She whistled through her teeth, a tuneless rendition of a Militarum marching song. They sing… And it was not just the procession. There were other Sisters here too: squads deployed to protect the Militarum’s flanks. Their armour was likewise black, their cloaks red, and they fought fearlessly, hurling themselves at the foe. He’d seen them earlier, from the corner of his eye, seen them move like… Again, he caught himself. A distance away, only visible by the light of its electro-sconces, was their Order’s battle sanctum, sacred and off limits, the towering cathedral one of the few buildings still half-intact. It was defended by four faceless, armoured figures, and he worried that they would hear if he thought too loud. He put a hand to the talisman in his jacket. It was a little thing, a carved effigy of the Emperor that he’d made himself, when he’d been stuck in a mudhole on the Salyon moon. It gave him hope – made him believe that they could win this. In the end. He was taking another tentative sip when the monster struck. It came out of nothing, as if born from the darkness. And it fell upon Kewa, ripping her clean in half. Hot gore slicked Mase’s skin. Casting her shredded pieces scornfully aside, it leered down at him, grinning. By His name, it stank. For the tiniest moment, Mase gawked. Then: mayhem. Reflexes swift, he was shouting the alarm, hurling the still-steaming recaff, mess tin and all, into the thing’s face. With instincts drilled into him from years of training, he went straight for his lasrifle, always at his right-hand side. Shouts and movement came through the darkness; the rest of the platoon were on their feet, already running. In the vox, the sergeant was barking orders, questions, but he was too far away. Everyone was too far away. But, with His blessing, the recaff had been enough, just enough, to make the thing pause. It had claws and a grotesque face, semi-human, but teeth in all the wrong places. Its skin was rotted and sloughing off where the liquid had burned it; its compound eyes were red and swelling. It hissed at him, but he had the rifle now and was bringing it up, ready to fire. He was too close. He smacked the rifle-butt neatly into its claws, and it grabbed and pulled, snarling. Still on his arse, Mase scrabbled backwards, trying to reclaim the weapon. He shouted into the vox, ‘Mase! To me! To me!’ Alarums blared, and the patrolling Sentinel’s lumens flared in his direction. There was the distinctive click-click of its weapons tracking – though it surely wouldn’t fire at its own campsite. A second, bigger floodlight snapped his way, dazzling. And– By the Emperor! He saw her, he saw her, right there, like a vision: an armoured silhouette, the glare behind her. Her helm shone, her black armour glowed at its edges, her red cloak billowed as if she were framed by blood. A Sister of Battle. He had no idea how she’d got there; she was surely a ­miracle. But He had seen fit, for whatever reason, to spare Mase’s humble life. ‘Get back.’ In the vox, her voice sounded young, but it was impossible to tell. The bolter in her hand shone like His blessing as she raised it and blasted the thing full in the chest. Fluids splattered, the hexi went out. Mase managed to scrabble to his feet, freeing his rifle at last, but she was already between him and the beast. The rest of the platoon had stopped dead. ‘Hold your fire!’ The sergeant barked the order, but the command was unnecessary. The Sister was too close to the beast. She ignored them. The thing was still moving, still hissing. Ichor dripped from its body, its mouldering skin. A burst of hymnal came from her, as bright as the bolter’s flare; she shot again, and again. It slashed at her, once, twice, with two heavy, claw-tipped arms. Scrapes screeched across her armour. What in His name was this creature? But she did not pause, her song did not falter. She pressed forwards, pace by pace, indomitable, shooting it again, again, again. It did not retreat. Its teeth closed on her helm, skidded off. The claws flashed at her pauldrons, putting dents in the ceramite. She shot it a fifth time, a sixth, and finally, it began to weaken, its knees giving way. ‘Sarge?’ A shocked voice came through the darkness. ‘Full perimeter defence!’ The sergeant’s bark was edged. ‘Don’t let any more through!’ Mase, gawping, had stopped, his rifle clutched in one nerveless hand. The thing was struggling, still trying to slash at her legs as it went down, but she was a flare of cloak, a wall of armour. As she moved, the floodlight picked out the scraps of parchment fixed to its surfaces, each one inscribed with a prayer. Her bolter glinted like resolution. At last, the thing tumbled. With a grim resolve, she put one black boot on its shoulder and shot downwards, right in its face. It spluttered, gagged, and went still. Nothing moved. The sergeant stood silent, staring; Mase could see his filthy, shocked face in the harsh glare of the floodlight. His shadow angled out along the ground, hard as determination. The Sister, still not paying them any attention, kicked the thing over, put another shot into its skull. Then she turned to where Mase stood, his hands still wrapped round his unused rifle as if it were the only thing that made sense in this insane world. ‘Are you hurt?’ she asked him. ‘I…’ He had no idea what he was supposed to call her – milady, ma’am? Did she have a rank? He could see no recognisable insignia. ‘No, Sister.’ It seemed to be the safest thing to say. ‘Good.’ Her helm moved and she was looking down at Kewa, shredded like so much fabric. In the rush, Mase had not looked at her and suddenly he faltered as her loss, the nearness of his own miss, hit him like a fist in the temple. He found himself on his knees, throwing up a stream of sooty bile. Kewa’s eyes were glass, empty. Dirt was already ­settling in them. And her torso… He looked away, and tried not to throw up again. ‘Do not be concerned,’ the Sister told him gently. He glanced up, blinking. ‘She died facing the foe,’ the Sister said. ‘She stands before the Throne in honour and in His grace. You should grieve for her, as is proper, but have no fear for her soul. Her time of strife is done, and she may rest.’ There was a burr of pain in her voice, human, and oddly touching. Numbly, he nodded. ‘Yes, Sister. Thank you, Sister.’ ‘All right, lad.’ The sergeant’s hand came down on Mase’s shoulder. ‘Fun’s over. Sister, we owe you our gratitude.’ ‘It’s why I’m here, sergeant,’ she said. ‘A service will be held at twenty-one hundred, Terran standard. With what you have just witnessed, I will expect you to attend.’ ‘Thank you, Sister,’ the sergeant said, again. He poked a boot at Mase, and Mase belatedly remembered his manners. ‘Yes… thank you, Sister,’ he repeated. ‘I will… ah… attend, of course.’ He was stuttering. Was he supposed to salute her? He made the effort to stand up, though his legs still shook. The sergeant was already shouting. ‘All right, listen up! Peri­meter defences doubled! And I want to know how in the name of the Emper… ah’ – he remembered himself – ‘how that thing got through here!’ ‘They crawl,’ the Sister said. ‘Belly down in the darkness, and slithering. They are cunning, and can affect both your mind and your heart. Be vigilant, sergeant, and hold Him in your thoughts, always.’ The sergeant offered an aquila salute. ‘Understood.’ ‘Know that He is with you, on Kiros, and all across the galaxy.’ She paused, and Mase almost heard her smile. ‘The battle for this world will not go on forever. We are here to see it ended.’ The sergeant returned, ‘Sister. Ave Imperator.’ But Mase could say nothing more, had nothing more to say. Rather than looking down at the remains of his fallen comrade, he watched the Sister’s armoured figure as it turned, taking in the sight. The odd burr of pain was back in her voice as she said, ‘His bless­ing upon you.’ And then she walked away, her black armour still shining as if it carried His very promise. Careful not to make it audible, Mase let out his breath. The sergeant raised an eyebrow. ‘Don’t let it go to your head, son,’ he said. ‘Find a gunny sack, and we’ll put Kewa with the others. And you heard what she said – you be at that service!’ ‘Sarge.’ A couple of his platoon-mates were lingering, questions on all their faces, but they could wait. If Kewa lay with Him, then he owed it to her memory to tend to her properly. Turning from the battered Militarum soldiers, Sister Avra felt a stab of regret. She belonged to the Order of Our Martyred Lady, and her death in combat was expected, the highest honour. But not here, not now. Her life had been refused, and instead, her sacred black armour was scratched and dented. The damage pressed inwards, hard lines of failure against the padding she wore. She knew she should return to the sanctum, but there was a coil of hurt in her heart. Understand your instincts, child, her schola tutors had taught her – had it only been two Solar years before? They come from Him, they are your teachers, and they will show you much. She walked on, a prayer on her lips, seeking His wisdom. Avra’s Order were the faithful of Saint Katherine, deployed to Kiros to end the war. The mission was not unusual, but when she had learned the full brief, about the presence of the saint herself… In His name, she could never have dreamed of such a blessing! The Triumph of Saint Katherine, the saint’s very bones, borne in holy and ceaseless procession, out across the galaxy – it was here. A beacon of courage, guarded by six Sisters, exemplars and representatives. They were chosen by Him to stand with the saint and to carry her strength forth, to proclaim her name and His light! In the chapel of the Sword of Bridiga, Avra had fallen to her knees, unworthy, blessed, elated, overcome. Her heart had rung with song, a threnody that may have been either celebration or lament. She prayed, humbly but with longing, that she may even see the saint for herself – she and her Sisters were taking turns as honour guard. And she’d prayed, even harder, for the chance to offer her life. Stepping past the scattered bivouacs, mess tents, armouries, communications hubs, she used her preysight to watch for more of the crawling beasts. The company enginseer flowed past her, ducking from her way, though his attendant servo-skulls and mechadendrites all turned to follow her. Like everything else, his red cloak was covered with soot. Somewhere, soldiers’ voices were raised in raucous song. It was a hymn, but sung as only the Militarum could manage. She controlled a twitch of a smile. Avra had been raised on Fura IV, bleak and severe. Her father and brother had been Third Furan Rangers, but her mother had given her life for her family, dying in childbirth as Avra’s brother was born. Avra had been six, her mother’s death a moment of great questioning and even greater, unshakable faith. Even now, Avra ached to be worthy of such sacrifice… Ached to be worthy of her saint. Fully identifying her curl of disappointment, she paused, chastising herself for the unworthiness of her thought. Her life was not hers to discard, even in battle. Her death was His, in His hands, at His will. Her martyrdom would happen as He decreed, in the proper time, and in the proper place. Walk with us, O Emperor. Her thoughts calmer, she glanced around. Her restless, introspective walking had taken her to the outermost edge of the encampment, within blessed sight of where the Sisters of the Triumph of Saint Katherine had established their own sanctum – taking over a tiny local chapel, its walls and tower all mosaicked with shattered ceramic. It was beautiful, brightly coloured and unique. Its minute windows shone with the light of the saint within. Avra dropped to her knees, her gauntleted hands tracing a fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour. She had never thought she would be this close, had never dreamed that she would witness this hallowed miracle, let alone be blessed enough to walk behind it. She intended to bow her head – but the windows flared with His light, and the sight before her was lost. She stands upon a battlefield, ablaze with wrath and fury. She wields a blade that carves limbs and heads and flesh. She bears a great shield against which the foe shatters, tumbling in dust and fragments. And those fragments fuse together, each one melding with its fellows. They become stones, become rocks, become walls. Become the crystal glassaic of a great cathedral’s windows. Fire bathes her; it flares from her armour, from her very heart. She burns, but the pain is good, like the purity of total immolation. In the flame-light, the glassaic windows are brought to life, every one an image. In one: an agri world, rippling with crops. In another: a convent, quiet and secluded. In a third: the kneeling forms of Sisters, robes pooled upon a flagstone floor. And there are more: a man, radiant with dark power and terrible authority. Trust and truth that char right through, like fluttering pieces of fabric. The sickening lurch of a terrible, soul-devastating betrayal. And then more: a duel, upon which the galaxy waits. The windows cannot contain the images. They waver and melt, and their running, puddled colours reflect the clouds. They become steam, and are gone. And still, she burns. But now, her agony is glorious. She becomes a hymn, raised to a darkness-filled sky. Buildings burn, pillars of smoke rise as if they hold up the very clouds. Further and further spreads the maze of burning streets, stretching back to impossible distance. It is all about her, but she is its hub and its centre and she stands, she always stands… The shield is back in her hand, but now, she bears her sword in the other. She slays the rising monster. The young soldier is her brother for whom her mother died, her still-youthful father; he may be but one tiny speck upon the surface of the Emperor’s Hammer, but he matters. They all matter. Comprehension hits her like a blaze of truth, like a bone spur. She feels her gorget give, feels that cold spur as it spikes sideways through her throat. As it carves out the side of her neck. Her flame gouts, wild and fervent. Her song hits its crescendo, with power to shatter walls. The monsters cower before her. The song is her requiem. She feels her carotid artery as it bursts, feels her lifeblood pouring forth. It is His greatest blessing, His answer, the thing she had come seeking. ‘Thank you,’ says her fiery heart. ‘Thank you.’ She smells the faintest wisp of incense. Then the flame flares dazzling, and she burns away. Click here to buy The Triumph of Saint Katherine.",

      "content": "The great ship groaned. She hung in the void like a thing dead: a steel shell, gutted and creaking. No life stirred upon her gantries or gunnery decks, no figures knelt within her silent chapel. Her levels were dark, her lumens exhausted. And yet, somewhere in her cavernous depths, there glimmered suitlights. Six shifting circles of pale visibility shone out like search beams, glittering from the frost-cold steel of the walls. A squad of armoured warriors followed a walkway, single file. Though they walked slowly, their steps echoed in metallic ripples from the endless, empty mazes of corridors and conduits. And with them, there came the faintest glimmer of song. Domine, libra nos… Holding her place in the centre of the line, both hands on her bolter, Augusta Santorus raised the Litany of Battle alongside her Sisters, their harmonics like tendrils, unfurling through the chill. Ahead of her, Sister Superior Veradis moved at the front of the exploring squad, her bolt pistol in one hand and her auspex, its screen shimmering a dull green, in the other. From the lightning and the tempest… The litany was familiar, steadying. It flowed like shared strength between the six figures, their blood-scarlet armour all ceramite and plasteel, their cloaks black and white. Each one bore the embroidered symbol of the Bloody Rose, the Order Militant of the Adepta Sororitas dispatched to scout this floating corpse. Their mission, to look for survivors – and to protect the interests of the Ecclesiarchy, to whom this ship belonged. But, search though they might, the cruiser Santa Xenia hung silent, her carcass already rotting. ‘Keep the line tight.’ Veradis’ orders sounded quietly in the squad’s vox-beads. Amid the flow of the litany, the Sister Superior was listening. Our Emperor, deliver us… Behind Veradis, Augusta continued to sing, her voice weaving in with that of her Sisters. In the chapels and cathedrals of the schola on Ophelia VII, it was easy to perceive Him, standing stern and patient at prayer, or overseeing their combat training as they battled beneath His gaze. But here– The thought was unworthy and she silenced it, concentrating on the hymn. From plague, temptation and war… The litany was absolute: He was everywhere. As the squad moved down another metal stairway, past another layer of hatches and vents, so they raised His name, and His presence walked with them. Our Emperor, deliver us… Even here, down in the depths of this great, steel sepulchre. ‘I fear the spirit of this vessel is fading,’ Veradis said, her tone still quiet. ‘Yet the retention of her atmosphere and grav-field suggests that she may still be occupied. We will proceed along the lowest gantries, down towards the fusion reactor. If any spark of life remains, I suspect that is where we shall find it.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad returned their obedience, and Augusta followed the line as it turned through a T-junction and began to move lower. From the scourge of the Kraken… But still, she kept the hymn in her heart. The ambush was loud, and clumsy. They had descended two more levels, right down to the creaking, filthy access paths of the Xenia’s lowest helots. Pict screens set into terminals fizzled with white noise. They cast ghostly illumination on rust-flowering walls, and upon their own half-loose wiring, hanging like exposed nerves. Augusta’s red boot came down beside a fallen servo-skull. It grinned eyelessly back at her, mocking. ‘’Ware!’ The cry came from ahead, from Sister Leona. Instinctively, Augusta dropped to a combat-crouch, her bolter covering the corridor. In the narrow beams of the suitlights, she had an erratic, confused view of incoming motion: of muscle and steel; of bared, yellow fangs; of the eager, jagged glint of corroding augmetics. A second later, there came the thunderously red muzzle flash of Leona’s heavy bolter, opening to its full suppression. The noise was tremendous. Over the vox, Veradis gave orders, her tone calm: ‘Leona, lay down covering fire, keep them back.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us… The bolter hammered its song of war. The shapes stumbled, cursed, bellowed, fell. Voices bawled, coarse and mocking. There was an answering return of fire, and the smashing of melee weapons against metal armour. Explosions chewed up the corridor and ricocheted, sparking, from the walls. Water and refuse scattered under repeated impacts. ‘Emlyn!’ Veradis snapped. ‘Do you have contact?’ ‘Aye!’ At the rear of the squad, Sister Emlyn’s response was drowned out by another burst of bolter-fire – the ambush was converging from both ends. Beside Augusta, Sister Lucienne spat a curse – in the turmoil and the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The litany spilling from her like determination, Augusta came back upright, trying for a clear line of sight. Somewhere in the darkness, deep, tuneless voices launched into a squalid ditty, then scattered again, laughing. Orks. Augusta’s heart thumped in her chest. Orks had found the floating ship – scavengers, perhaps. The seethe of muscle and weapon took on form and comprehension, became shapes she recognised. She’d never seen an ork in the flesh, but she’d studied their images on the schola’s data-slates many times… she’d just never realised how big they were, how slavering and coarse. Her voice sang, furious and elated. Our Emperor, deliver us! They were xenos, invaders on an Ecclesiarchy ship. And they would die. She took a single shot over Emlyn’s shoulder, heard the squall as her carbide fusion matrix round bit into thick, green flesh. She heard Veradis ordering Leona to keep firing, and for the squad to advance, step by step, behind her cover. She heard Emlyn, the litany rising savagely from the rearmost Sister. She saw the whoosh of Sister Pia’s flamer, bathing the corridor in its sudden conflagration. She heard howls of pain and rage; she heard explosions, and the guttural derision of the orks’ voices. She heard one of her Sisters hiss with a sudden stab of agony, but she couldn’t tell who. ‘The corridor’s blocked with corpses!’ The voice was Leona’s. ‘We can go no further!’ ‘Gantry to the left,’ Veradis snapped. ‘We’ll get behind them!’ Augusta obeyed the order and ran. Behind her, Lucienne did the same, her armour gleaming in the firelight’s dance. They skidded, their footing slippery with spreading gore. The whole space seemed full of struggles and curses, of the bulk of muscle and metal. A huge, hoary hand grabbed for Augusta’s shoulder. She turned and put a round into the leering greenskin, then she was up the steps and out of its reach. ‘Throne!’ As they reached the gantry, Lucienne cursed again. ‘Where did they even come from?’ The last of the firelight flickered from a mess of struggling orks. They were undisciplined and rough, fighting amongst themselves now, all striving to get to the front. The biggest had a huge, notched axe, and it was hacking the smaller ones to pieces as it waded forwards. Even as it reached the steps, Veradis’ bolt pistol took it clean in the face, and it went over, bawling and kicking. The smaller ones were on it in a moment, enacting their bloody revenge. ‘Keep moving!’ The Sister Superior’s tone was grim. ‘And keep your vigilance, Sisters – there will be more!’ From the begetting of daemons… Red boots bashed along the walkway. The litany continued, fervent, tight with focus and rage. The orks were pausing now, abandoning their burned and their fallen. They seemed to be retreating, but they gave harsh, guttural snarls. ‘There will be more of them,’ Veradis said. ‘Now, move!’ The squad began to run. Corridor and gantry turned though a bend and became a steel bridge, suspended over a sheer, bottomless drop. Cold yawned at them from below, a dead breath from some vast and empty space, but Augusta paid it little attention – she was watching for more orks. Which was probably why she missed the gretchin completely. It was too small, too fast. With a high-pitched gibber, it hurled itself from the darkness, grappling for a hold. Startled, Augusta sent her shot wide. The thing hit her shoulders and faceplate, knocking her backwards; she grabbed at it with her free hand, striving to prise it free as it chittered and clawed, ramming its nimble fingers into the edges of her visor. She cursed, pulled, threw– But it was too late. Without realising, she’d taken another step back. She felt her heel go, tried to catch herself, made a belated grab for Lucienne’s outstretched hand… …missed it. Lucienne cried aloud, ‘Sister!’ In a split second of utter disbelief, Augusta realised she was falling, down, down, into the dark. Our Emperor, deliver us! Lucienne was shouting for Veradis, but the noise was already lost, too far above her to be possible. Incomprehension clamoured loud – she had no idea how she could have done something so foolish – then a steel girder caught her, slam, across the base of her spine. She grunted, scrabbled for a handhold, but her momentum turned her head over heels and dropped her, once more, into the depths of some utter, pitch-black nothing. By the–! She hit the bottom belly first, hard enough to rattle her teeth. Stunned, she lay there, tasting blood from a bitten tongue. She was half-immersed in the thick soup of the ship’s bilge, but she was alive, thank His grace and mercy; she was still breathing. Her hips hurt where she’d struck the girder, but her suit diagnostic was still showing full integrity. From the curse of the mutant… The litany in her heart like a prayer of gratitude, she pushed herself to her hands and knees, and looked round. She had no idea where she was. What? A spike of nervousness shot through her chest. She could see nothing, just the ripples of the water in an impenetrable cavern of black. The gleam of her suitlight was tiny, swallowed whole by the space around her. There was no light above her, no sign of her Sisters, no hint of the walkway from which she’d fallen. As she sat back on her heels, reaching for her bolter, a savage spasm of pain shot through her back. There was nothing broken, but she’d lost her weapon. Sudden adrenaline flashed; her hands searched frantically under the water. One of the schola’s earliest combat lessons: you never lost your bolter. It was a part of you, part of your faith and ordination. It was always in your hand, or fastened to your suit. A flicker of disappointment, like she’d let Him – let her squad and her training – down… But that thought felt like panic. She shoved it aside and tried the vox. The vox-channel was a crackling wasteland, devoid of life or hope. Just as if it, too, had no idea where she was. Our Emperor, deliver us… Slowly, holding the fear at bay, Augusta came to her feet. She drew the hidden punch-dagger from the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and took a full ten-second awareness check, turning slowly around. Nothing. Her mouth was filling with horror; her skin was shivering with chill… Nothing. A morte perpetua… Standing there, tiny and lost, she clung to dagger and litany like twin threads of pure hope. She prayed for His guidance, His strength, His light to bless her in this unknown darkness. She prayed for His forgiveness for her ridiculous blunder. And she remembered – forgiveness was only offered to those who fought on. She must focus. The one thing she knew: the Sisters’ muster point, back up at the observer deck. She must find a wall, and then a ladder. Once she was back up in the ship’s corridors, she could orient by their layout and numbering. She picked a direction and began to wade. The emptiness was vast, and absolute. Her hands constantly reaching for her bolter and coming back empty, Augusta moved through the ship’s belly like some tiny, squeaking thing, her position marked clearly by her suitlight and by the flowing arrowhead of ripples that pointed at her, wherever she went. In the viscous, filthy water, things bumped at her calves, almost as if they sought to harry her along. She swallowed her nausea, and forged past them. That thou wouldst bring them only death… She told herself: she knew this, knew the drill that came with it. She knew to conserve her water and rations, knew to set the beacon on her suit so her squad could detect the signal. But, like the orks, this had only ever been theory. A cruiser was a diagram on a data-slate, a tidy cutaway that bristled with clarity and labels. She knew where the observer deck was – it was up at the watch gallery, below the keel sail. But this…? She could not falter, it was not permitted. So she waded on, hard shocks of pain in her back with every step. She shone her little light as far as she could, but still, she found nothing; it was as if she’d been swallowed alive. She had no idea, even, if she was going the right way, or if she was just walking in circles. There were no labels down here, no handy descriptions – not as much as a magnetic field for her digi-compass. That thou shouldst spare none… But… she had no choice. She forced her way forwards through the water, searching with increasing fear for an edge, a way up, for anything that would bring the darkness back to a graspable size. And, as she pushed on, and on, and still on, and there was still nothing, the desolation of it began to spiral outwards from around her, vast and cold; it made her head spin and her breath catch like spikes in her throat. This could not be a ship; it was a scraping, groaning, rasping, lightless void, echoing with horror. The creaking was some endless, mournful cry; it crawled with unseen threats. It stretched around her like a thing eternal, like– Her chrono chimed the hour, and the faint, familiar song of bells echoed outwards over the water. It brought her back to herself and she stopped, holding her breath to listen. But still, nothing moved. Only the cold. Only the darkness. And only the things that bumped against her shins… By the Light! Where am I? What have I–? With a wrench of effort, she ground herself back into motion. She tried to keep praying, but the words were hollowing, now, and slowly, slowly, they bled from her like the dark was full of leeches. Her hand tightened on her dagger until her gauntleted fingers hurt. Soon, she began to hear other noises – noises like voices, like echoes of remembered hymns, like splashes in the limitless murk. Once, she thought she heard gunfire, and she almost ran in the direction of the sound, but it faded before she’d gone very far. The things in the water bumped and bumped at her; she had to stop herself shuddering and kicking back at them, shoving them away. Sometimes, her suitlight picked up odd gleams under the surface, as if some eyeless, deep-dwelling creature were baring its hungry teeth… How could there be no end to this? Surely, even if she were in the very bottom of the ship’s hull, there would be…? And then, she saw something. It was a support, a mighty, riveted pillar of steel that stretched upwards, high into the dark. It was pitch-black, utterly smooth and completely devoid of ladders, or of identification. It was ice-cold, glittering with frost. And it bore words. What? Augusta blinked, wondered if the darkness was playing some trick, but no, she was not seeing things. The words were like shadows in the pale chill; they looked like they’d been made with a finger. They said, ‘Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos’. The Emperor has forsaken us. Pure, stark cold went down her back. Forsaken. She turned, put her back to the metal and raised the dagger, but she could see nothing. Beyond her tiny suitlight, the darkness concealed a thousand eyes, a thousand questions. A thousand unseen tentacles uncoiled like Ruin from the water. Forsaken. What had happened to the ship? They had seen no sign of her crew, no signs of combat, not even bodies. She tried to tell herself that this was surely some lost crew member, scared and alone, but what if it wasn’t? What if the words had been written by something else? Something forsaken? She stayed where she was, her heart racing. Slowly, the ripples of her passage flattened and she watched the water, alert for any shine or swell. Again, she tried the vox, but it crackled at her, the noise filling her head and chest with static. Adrenaline screamed at her, told her to move – move! – but she could not. There was something out there. Something that knew exactly where she was. A thought came at her as if it were not her own, a tiny sliver of doubt in her adamantine faith. What if… What if He really had abandoned her? Punished her for her foolishness? She had no Sisters to guard her back, no bolter to slay her foe. Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos. Another splash, now closer, the noise unmistakeable… There really was something down here! Her blood thumped hard in her ears. She strained to hear past it. She was sure that, this time, the sound had been real, not the yammering of her doubts, not these monsters internal that threatened to undermine and betray her. She held the blade like a talisman, praying for His light, for His forgiveness. For His wisdom in the dark. Her every nerve shivered with– There! And another splash. The faintest of ripples, like a windless whisper across the black water’s surface. They teased at the very limits of her suitlight’s range. That thou shouldst pardon none… The litany came back to her in a flood, the words almost frantic. Her mind filled with the white fuzz of tension, her tongue seemed cleaved to the roof of her mouth. Doubts hammered at her heart like weapons… she struggled to force them down. She had fallen, disgraced herself. She had lost her bolter, an unthinkable sin. Forsaken. There was uncertainty in her heart and mind and chest, where there should be only strength and courage… Splash! Again. The noises were somewhere to her right. The sounds were too light for the heavy-booted orks, too slow for the gretchin. Her dread crystallised, shattered. I am Adepta Sororitas, and I fear nothing, not xenos, not heretic, not creature of Ruin… She closed her hand on the tiny blade, and forced herself to move. Her hips still spasmed with pain, but she followed the sounds. As she moved, the darkness seemed to shift about her like unheard laughter; it blew through her, mocking her weakness, and she strove to shut it out. She focused her mind on searching for markings or discrepancies, for anything that would tell her where she was. She had not gone much further before she found a second, colossal support and a second finger-mark, this one jagged with anger and pain, and much shorter. It said only, ‘Salva nos’. Save us. From what? Again, she turned, putting her back to the metal. The darkness howled back to its full strength, invading her thoughts like a plague. What had taken place upon this empty ship? Slain her crew and left her to drift, alone and abandoned? Striving for calm, she reviewed her orders and the information that Veradis had given them, but there were no answers. Only… only that they’d found no bodies. At least, not in the ship itself. Because… because they were all down here? Her nausea rose again, bitter in the back of her throat. A image of eyeless, rotting, bumping things came flooding into her mind, all bared bone and trailing wires and rancid, bloating flesh– Again, that splash, closer this time; she could see the ripples as they spread, hear them as they lapped gently against the column’s cold steel. Whatever it was, it was near. That nearness honed her fears down to a single, hard target – there! She moved towards the sound, her blade ready. And then, at last, she saw the faintest glimmering of the light. It came from above, from some walkway, impossibly high above her head, but it did not shine upon the bilge-water. There was something in the way. Something big. At first, she couldn’t make it out – it seemed like some huge, lumpish blur – but as she grew closer, she realised what it was. It was a pile, pointing roughly upwards at that glimmer of illumination. It was– She stopped, her mouth full of revulsion, her suitlight illuminating something grotesque: corpses, bloated, blank-faced and rotting. Hundreds of them. Even as she looked, craning up and up towards the light above, something fell and tumbled slowly down the side of the pile. It hit the water. Splash. Augusta stood there, transfixed. She could see the rotting insignias of the Xenia’s crew, and her mind struggled to find a prayer – for them, for herself – but her words were lost. Splash. She stepped closer, dagger still in hand. Where her suitlight shone, she could see pieces of faces almost intact – a young officer, barely more than a boy; a man in the rank remains of Ecclesiarchy robes; a servitor, rusted and still. Forsaken. By the rot of their remaining flesh, they’d all been dead some time. Then a deep growl of laughter made her turn. It was an ork. Just the one, and at first, Augusta struggled to believe what she was seeing. It was far bigger than she was, armour and all, a hulking, muscled monstrosity with a wide and toothy grin. But this one bore no metal – no augmetics or ornamentation of any kind, not a single shiny or reflective surface. And it was not green. In her suitlight, it looked… it looked purple. Seeing her raise her little dagger, it gave an audible snort and grinned wider. Shreds of flesh and fabric were still caught between its fangs. Forsaken. The fate of the Xenia’s crew… some of them must have been still alive, thrown down here in despair and desolation, knowing they had no escape, and waiting for the orks to… Her nerves spiked with revulsion. With fury. And this, she understood. She lunged and struck, her feet hampered by the water. Her blade struck the hollow of the beast’s throat, but the ork wore thick, grox-leather armour. Its grin broadened further. Her doubts, her fears, shattered. We beseech Thee, destroy them! Red-hot rage went through her – cleansing like fire. She raised her voice, sang the litany straight at the ork, heard the words ring back from the darkness as if the Xenia sang with her, finding its own faith and courage. She punched it, dagger between her fingers, full in the face. One eye popped and ran down its hide. Snarling, it pounced forwards. As the punches came in, she threw up her arms, blocking them as she had been taught. She was fast enough, but by the Light, the thing was immensely strong. It hammered at her with fists the size of rams, battering at her head and shoulders. One connected and her ears rang; the force of it snapped her neck over with a painful wrench. The hurt in her hips was climbing her spine like a live thing, all claws and spikes; she could feel something twanging, but she could not stop. Seeing a gap, she struck out with the dagger. It hit, but she might as well have been stabbing a training dummy. The ork snarled, pressing her back, into the pile of bodies behind her. If they fell… How many had died, thrown down here? Lost to the Light, and to their own faith? Watching as the orks ate their shipmates? Knowing they would be next? The thought fuelled her rage, and she surged forwards. She missed a block and the thing pummelled her faceplate. Missed another and one huge fist connected with her chest, sending her backwards with a crunch of crumpled armour. She kicked down at its knee, hard enough to break the bone. It growled and stumbled. Then it came back upright, and hit her with a full-charge body slam, its shoulder to her gut. They both went over, into the pile of dead. Her back wrenched, she gritted her teeth against a cry of pain. The corpses were a sliding cascade, a splashing avalanche of bodies that smothered her and the ork both. She struggled and rolled, found herself on her belly with the ork on top of her; she could see nothing but corpses, and the soup-thick mess of the bilge. The ork was upright first; it drove a knee into her back, hard. Pain exploded across her vision. It had a hand on her wrist, was trying to her wrench her armoured shoulder around and back. She struggled, almost crying aloud as her spine crunched with every motion. The thing was so powerful – how could it be so powerful? ‘Sister.’ The word was a hiss, laden with hate. ‘You – not so strong.’ This was not the ribald scorn of the foot-troops upstairs. This beast was something completely else, something dark and sharp and sinister. It said, ‘He – is not here. You die – hopeless.’ She got one arm under her, tried to push herself up. She reached for a prayer, for His courage and Light to fill her body, for the battle-rage that came with the song of His name, but there was no squad, and no harmony. She was alone. Bereft. No Sisters to sing His praises, no weapons to thunder His name… He – is not here. You die – hopeless. Forsaken. The ork drove its weight downwards, knee first. It was still wrenching at her arm. Impossibly, she heard the crack as her armour started to crumple. She must get back to her feet, stop this beast from killing and eating her… Salva nos! Her backplate cracked further. There was a whoosh as the seal gave, and the first freezing touch of the toxic water. She struggled furiously, but could not move. The ork paused, relishing the moment. She could almost hear it grin. Any second now, it would stamp down with its full weight and crush her back like a wet stick. And then… ‘There are times…’ her tutor’s words came back to her, ghosts in the dark, ‘…when He will test you. Pain, dread, death – all of these things are His blessing. And you will face them, Sisters, though they drag barbed hooks through the darkest corners of your soul. When you are at your lowest ebb, facing the very worst of your terrors… that is when He will be watching you.’ Was He here, now, closer than ever, down in these deep, dark depths? The thought was electric, a crackle of terror and energy. She remembered the lesson fully: that courage, like fear, comes from within. With a roar like pure, focused faith, she pushed with her free arm and went over sideways, rolling the ork beneath her armoured weight and shoving it under the water. Ignoring the pain, she flipped herself over and came down on its chest with both knees, whooshing the air from its lungs in a trail of exploding bubbles. It thrashed frantically, but she had it now, and the full weight of her body was keeping it under the water. With a prayer as sharp as the edge of the blade, she brought her punch-dagger down in the thing’s other eye. It spasmed, blood and fluid flowing through the water, but still it struggled on. She rammed the dagger in under its chin, driving it down with all the force she could muster and through the layer of armour. In nomine Eius! And – in His name – the thing, finally, went still. ‘You have faced quite the ordeal, Sister.’ Back on the observer’s deck, Veradis stood with folded arms and a severe expression. ‘For any Sororitas to fight alone in close quarters against an ork – truly, you have faced foe, fear and darkness, and you have been blessed by His strength.’ She raised an eyebrow. ‘However.’ The word had a knell of finality to it, and Augusta inhaled, making her back spike with pain. She said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The Sister Superior said nothing. Her armour, like Augusta’s, bore warmarks – clear signs that the squad had fought their way through to the muster point. At the Ritual of Cleansing, these would be beaten and polished, cleaned until the armour shone once more. In the field, they were badges of honour. Veradis continued, her tone flat. ‘You abandoned your squad, and returned without your weapon.’ Her lean, lined face did not change. ‘Such carelessness is unworthy of an Adepta Sororitas.’ The other members of the squad had closed around them, Lucienne with a brief smile for her friend. They were all ork-battered and sweating, but after Augusta’s ordeal, her feeling of being so lost and alone, she was thankful for every one of them – for their strength and faith, for their closeness and for how much she trusted them. Augusta lifted her chin. ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ ‘Recite for me,’ Veradis said, ‘the third stanza of the fourth book of the War Treatise of Saint Mina.’ Augusta knew the words, they were etched upon her mind and heart. She said, ‘We are Sisters beneath His light. We obey our orders without question. We do not falter. We do not fear. We do not err.’ ‘We do not err,’ Veradis repeated, making the point. ‘There is no excuse for such a lack of vigilance, Sister. We are a family, we work as Sisters should, and our trust in one another must be absolute. If you cannot uphold that trust, you betray yourself, your squad, your commander and your faith. I comprehend that you have faced horrors to return to us – climbing the pile of the dead to reach the light – but to betray the squad’s unity is to leave a hole in our defences. This cannot be borne.’ Augusta could respond only, ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Veradis nodded at her contrition. ‘You will undertake the remainder of this mission with your dagger alone. I have no bolter for you, and the combat discipline will serve as a timely reminder – to sharpen your senses, Sister. And to uphold your faith.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Augusta felt her face flush, but it was the only reply she could give. Veradis nodded again, her expression softening. ‘Yet, I comprehend what you have faced to return to us. In His name, and in the name of Saint Mina herself, Augusta, I am glad that you are back. I would hate to have lost your strong arm in this most forsaken of places.’ A flicker of a smile crossed her face. ‘See to your armour, Sister, and fear not the lumbering greenskin. We have a mission to complete.’",

      "content": "The great ship groaned. She hung in the void like a thing dead: a steel shell, gutted and creaking. No life stirred upon her gantries or gunnery decks, no figures knelt within her silent chapel. Her levels were dark, her lumens exhausted. And yet, somewhere in her cavernous depths, there glimmered suitlights. Six shifting circles of pale visibility shone out like search beams, glittering from the frost-cold steel of the walls. A squad of armoured warriors followed a walkway, single file. Though they walked slowly, their steps echoed in metallic ripples from the endless, empty mazes of corridors and conduits. And with them, there came the faintest glimmer of song. Domine, libra nos… Holding her place in the centre of the line, both hands on her bolter, Augusta Santorus raised the Litany of Battle alongside her Sisters, their harmonics like tendrils, unfurling through the chill. Ahead of her, Sister Superior Veradis moved at the front of the exploring squad, her bolt pistol in one hand and her auspex, its screen shimmering a dull green, in the other. From the lightning and the tempest… The litany was familiar, steadying. It flowed like shared strength between the six figures, their blood-scarlet armour all ceramite and plasteel, their cloaks black and white. Each one bore the embroidered symbol of the Bloody Rose, the Order Militant of the Adepta Sororitas dispatched to scout this floating corpse. Their mission, to look for survivors – and to protect the interests of the Ecclesiarchy, to whom this ship belonged. But, search though they might, the cruiser Santa Xenia hung silent, her carcass already rotting. ‘Keep the line tight.’ Veradis’ orders sounded quietly in the squad’s vox-beads. Amid the flow of the litany, the Sister Superior was listening. Our Emperor, deliver us… Behind Veradis, Augusta continued to sing, her voice weaving in with that of her Sisters. In the chapels and cathedrals of the schola on Ophelia VII, it was easy to perceive Him, standing stern and patient at prayer, or overseeing their combat training as they battled beneath His gaze. But here– The thought was unworthy and she silenced it, concentrating on the hymn. From plague, temptation and war… The litany was absolute: He was everywhere. As the squad moved down another metal stairway, past another layer of hatches and vents, so they raised His name, and His presence walked with them. Our Emperor, deliver us… Even here, down in the depths of this great, steel sepulchre. ‘I fear the spirit of this vessel is fading,’ Veradis said, her tone still quiet. ‘Yet the retention of her atmosphere and grav-field suggests that she may still be occupied. We will proceed along the lowest gantries, down towards the fusion reactor. If any spark of life remains, I suspect that is where we shall find it.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad returned their obedience, and Augusta followed the line as it turned through a T-junction and began to move lower. From the scourge of the Kraken… But still, she kept the hymn in her heart. The ambush was loud, and clumsy. They had descended two more levels, right down to the creaking, filthy access paths of the Xenia’s lowest helots. Pict screens set into terminals fizzled with white noise. They cast ghostly illumination on rust-flowering walls, and upon their own half-loose wiring, hanging like exposed nerves. Augusta’s red boot came down beside a fallen servo-skull. It grinned eyelessly back at her, mocking. ‘’Ware!’ The cry came from ahead, from Sister Leona. Instinctively, Augusta dropped to a combat-crouch, her bolter covering the corridor. In the narrow beams of the suitlights, she had an erratic, confused view of incoming motion: of muscle and steel; of bared, yellow fangs; of the eager, jagged glint of corroding augmetics. A second later, there came the thunderously red muzzle flash of Leona’s heavy bolter, opening to its full suppression. The noise was tremendous. Over the vox, Veradis gave orders, her tone calm: ‘Leona, lay down covering fire, keep them back.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us… The bolter hammered its song of war. The shapes stumbled, cursed, bellowed, fell. Voices bawled, coarse and mocking. There was an answering return of fire, and the smashing of melee weapons against metal armour. Explosions chewed up the corridor and ricocheted, sparking, from the walls. Water and refuse scattered under repeated impacts. ‘Emlyn!’ Veradis snapped. ‘Do you have contact?’ ‘Aye!’ At the rear of the squad, Sister Emlyn’s response was drowned out by another burst of bolter-fire – the ambush was converging from both ends. Beside Augusta, Sister Lucienne spat a curse – in the turmoil and the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The litany spilling from her like determination, Augusta came back upright, trying for a clear line of sight. Somewhere in the darkness, deep, tuneless voices launched into a squalid ditty, then scattered again, laughing. Orks. Augusta’s heart thumped in her chest. Orks had found the floating ship – scavengers, perhaps. The seethe of muscle and weapon took on form and comprehension, became shapes she recognised. She’d never seen an ork in the flesh, but she’d studied their images on the schola’s data-slates many times… she’d just never realised how big they were, how slavering and coarse. Her voice sang, furious and elated. Our Emperor, deliver us! They were xenos, invaders on an Ecclesiarchy ship. And they would die. She took a single shot over Emlyn’s shoulder, heard the squall as her carbide fusion matrix round bit into thick, green flesh. She heard Veradis ordering Leona to keep firing, and for the squad to advance, step by step, behind her cover. She heard Emlyn, the litany rising savagely from the rearmost Sister. She saw the whoosh of Sister Pia’s flamer, bathing the corridor in its sudden conflagration. She heard howls of pain and rage; she heard explosions, and the guttural derision of the orks’ voices. She heard one of her Sisters hiss with a sudden stab of agony, but she couldn’t tell who. ‘The corridor’s blocked with corpses!’ The voice was Leona’s. ‘We can go no further!’ ‘Gantry to the left,’ Veradis snapped. ‘We’ll get behind them!’ Augusta obeyed the order and ran. Behind her, Lucienne did the same, her armour gleaming in the firelight’s dance. They skidded, their footing slippery with spreading gore. The whole space seemed full of struggles and curses, of the bulk of muscle and metal. A huge, hoary hand grabbed for Augusta’s shoulder. She turned and put a round into the leering greenskin, then she was up the steps and out of its reach. ‘Throne!’ As they reached the gantry, Lucienne cursed again. ‘Where did they even come from?’ The last of the firelight flickered from a mess of struggling orks. They were undisciplined and rough, fighting amongst themselves now, all striving to get to the front. The biggest had a huge, notched axe, and it was hacking the smaller ones to pieces as it waded forwards. Even as it reached the steps, Veradis’ bolt pistol took it clean in the face, and it went over, bawling and kicking. The smaller ones were on it in a moment, enacting their bloody revenge. ‘Keep moving!’ The Sister Superior’s tone was grim. ‘And keep your vigilance, Sisters – there will be more!’ From the begetting of daemons… Red boots bashed along the walkway. The litany continued, fervent, tight with focus and rage. The orks were pausing now, abandoning their burned and their fallen. They seemed to be retreating, but they gave harsh, guttural snarls. ‘There will be more of them,’ Veradis said. ‘Now, move!’ The squad began to run. Corridor and gantry turned though a bend and became a steel bridge, suspended over a sheer, bottomless drop. Cold yawned at them from below, a dead breath from some vast and empty space, but Augusta paid it little attention – she was watching for more orks. Which was probably why she missed the gretchin completely. It was too small, too fast. With a high-pitched gibber, it hurled itself from the darkness, grappling for a hold. Startled, Augusta sent her shot wide. The thing hit her shoulders and faceplate, knocking her backwards; she grabbed at it with her free hand, striving to prise it free as it chittered and clawed, ramming its nimble fingers into the edges of her visor. She cursed, pulled, threw– But it was too late. Without realising, she’d taken another step back. She felt her heel go, tried to catch herself, made a belated grab for Lucienne’s outstretched hand… …missed it. Lucienne cried aloud, ‘Sister!’ In a split second of utter disbelief, Augusta realised she was falling, down, down, into the dark. Our Emperor, deliver us! Lucienne was shouting for Veradis, but the noise was already lost, too far above her to be possible. Incomprehension clamoured loud – she had no idea how she could have done something so foolish – then a steel girder caught her, slam, across the base of her spine. She grunted, scrabbled for a handhold, but her momentum turned her head over heels and dropped her, once more, into the depths of some utter, pitch-black nothing. By the–! She hit the bottom belly first, hard enough to rattle her teeth. Stunned, she lay there, tasting blood from a bitten tongue. She was half-immersed in the thick soup of the ship’s bilge, but she was alive, thank His grace and mercy; she was still breathing. Her hips hurt where she’d struck the girder, but her suit diagnostic was still showing full integrity. From the curse of the mutant… The litany in her heart like a prayer of gratitude, she pushed herself to her hands and knees, and looked round. She had no idea where she was. What? A spike of nervousness shot through her chest. She could see nothing, just the ripples of the water in an impenetrable cavern of black. The gleam of her suitlight was tiny, swallowed whole by the space around her. There was no light above her, no sign of her Sisters, no hint of the walkway from which she’d fallen. As she sat back on her heels, reaching for her bolter, a savage spasm of pain shot through her back. There was nothing broken, but she’d lost her weapon. Sudden adrenaline flashed; her hands searched frantically under the water. One of the schola’s earliest combat lessons: you never lost your bolter. It was a part of you, part of your faith and ordination. It was always in your hand, or fastened to your suit. A flicker of disappointment, like she’d let Him – let her squad and her training – down… But that thought felt like panic. She shoved it aside and tried the vox. The vox-channel was a crackling wasteland, devoid of life or hope. Just as if it, too, had no idea where she was. Our Emperor, deliver us… Slowly, holding the fear at bay, Augusta came to her feet. She drew the hidden punch-dagger from the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and took a full ten-second awareness check, turning slowly around. Nothing. Her mouth was filling with horror; her skin was shivering with chill… Nothing. A morte perpetua… Standing there, tiny and lost, she clung to dagger and litany like twin threads of pure hope. She prayed for His guidance, His strength, His light to bless her in this unknown darkness. She prayed for His forgiveness for her ridiculous blunder. And she remembered – forgiveness was only offered to those who fought on. She must focus. The one thing she knew: the Sisters’ muster point, back up at the observer deck. She must find a wall, and then a ladder. Once she was back up in the ship’s corridors, she could orient by their layout and numbering. She picked a direction and began to wade. The emptiness was vast, and absolute. Her hands constantly reaching for her bolter and coming back empty, Augusta moved through the ship’s belly like some tiny, squeaking thing, her position marked clearly by her suitlight and by the flowing arrowhead of ripples that pointed at her, wherever she went. In the viscous, filthy water, things bumped at her calves, almost as if they sought to harry her along. She swallowed her nausea, and forged past them. That thou wouldst bring them only death… She told herself: she knew this, knew the drill that came with it. She knew to conserve her water and rations, knew to set the beacon on her suit so her squad could detect the signal. But, like the orks, this had only ever been theory. A cruiser was a diagram on a data-slate, a tidy cutaway that bristled with clarity and labels. She knew where the observer deck was – it was up at the watch gallery, below the keel sail. But this…? She could not falter, it was not permitted. So she waded on, hard shocks of pain in her back with every step. She shone her little light as far as she could, but still, she found nothing; it was as if she’d been swallowed alive. She had no idea, even, if she was going the right way, or if she was just walking in circles. There were no labels down here, no handy descriptions – not as much as a magnetic field for her digi-compass. That thou shouldst spare none… But… she had no choice. She forced her way forwards through the water, searching with increasing fear for an edge, a way up, for anything that would bring the darkness back to a graspable size. And, as she pushed on, and on, and still on, and there was still nothing, the desolation of it began to spiral outwards from around her, vast and cold; it made her head spin and her breath catch like spikes in her throat. This could not be a ship; it was a scraping, groaning, rasping, lightless void, echoing with horror. The creaking was some endless, mournful cry; it crawled with unseen threats. It stretched around her like a thing eternal, like– Her chrono chimed the hour, and the faint, familiar song of bells echoed outwards over the water. It brought her back to herself and she stopped, holding her breath to listen. But still, nothing moved. Only the cold. Only the darkness. And only the things that bumped against her shins… By the Light! Where am I? What have I–? With a wrench of effort, she ground herself back into motion. She tried to keep praying, but the words were hollowing, now, and slowly, slowly, they bled from her like the dark was full of leeches. Her hand tightened on her dagger until her gauntleted fingers hurt. Soon, she began to hear other noises – noises like voices, like echoes of remembered hymns, like splashes in the limitless murk. Once, she thought she heard gunfire, and she almost ran in the direction of the sound, but it faded before she’d gone very far. The things in the water bumped and bumped at her; she had to stop herself shuddering and kicking back at them, shoving them away. Sometimes, her suitlight picked up odd gleams under the surface, as if some eyeless, deep-dwelling creature were baring its hungry teeth… How could there be no end to this? Surely, even if she were in the very bottom of the ship’s hull, there would be…? And then, she saw something. It was a support, a mighty, riveted pillar of steel that stretched upwards, high into the dark. It was pitch-black, utterly smooth and completely devoid of ladders, or of identification. It was ice-cold, glittering with frost. And it bore words. What? Augusta blinked, wondered if the darkness was playing some trick, but no, she was not seeing things. The words were like shadows in the pale chill; they looked like they’d been made with a finger. They said, ‘Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos’. The Emperor has forsaken us. Pure, stark cold went down her back. Forsaken. She turned, put her back to the metal and raised the dagger, but she could see nothing. Beyond her tiny suitlight, the darkness concealed a thousand eyes, a thousand questions. A thousand unseen tentacles uncoiled like Ruin from the water. Forsaken. What had happened to the ship? They had seen no sign of her crew, no signs of combat, not even bodies. She tried to tell herself that this was surely some lost crew member, scared and alone, but what if it wasn’t? What if the words had been written by something else? Something forsaken? She stayed where she was, her heart racing. Slowly, the ripples of her passage flattened and she watched the water, alert for any shine or swell. Again, she tried the vox, but it crackled at her, the noise filling her head and chest with static. Adrenaline screamed at her, told her to move – move! – but she could not. There was something out there. Something that knew exactly where she was. A thought came at her as if it were not her own, a tiny sliver of doubt in her adamantine faith. What if… What if He really had abandoned her? Punished her for her foolishness? She had no Sisters to guard her back, no bolter to slay her foe. Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos. Another splash, now closer, the noise unmistakeable… There really was something down here! Her blood thumped hard in her ears. She strained to hear past it. She was sure that, this time, the sound had been real, not the yammering of her doubts, not these monsters internal that threatened to undermine and betray her. She held the blade like a talisman, praying for His light, for His forgiveness. For His wisdom in the dark. Her every nerve shivered with– There! And another splash. The faintest of ripples, like a windless whisper across the black water’s surface. They teased at the very limits of her suitlight’s range. That thou shouldst pardon none… The litany came back to her in a flood, the words almost frantic. Her mind filled with the white fuzz of tension, her tongue seemed cleaved to the roof of her mouth. Doubts hammered at her heart like weapons… she struggled to force them down. She had fallen, disgraced herself. She had lost her bolter, an unthinkable sin. Forsaken. There was uncertainty in her heart and mind and chest, where there should be only strength and courage… Splash! Again. The noises were somewhere to her right. The sounds were too light for the heavy-booted orks, too slow for the gretchin. Her dread crystallised, shattered. I am Adepta Sororitas, and I fear nothing, not xenos, not heretic, not creature of Ruin… She closed her hand on the tiny blade, and forced herself to move. Her hips still spasmed with pain, but she followed the sounds. As she moved, the darkness seemed to shift about her like unheard laughter; it blew through her, mocking her weakness, and she strove to shut it out. She focused her mind on searching for markings or discrepancies, for anything that would tell her where she was. She had not gone much further before she found a second, colossal support and a second finger-mark, this one jagged with anger and pain, and much shorter. It said only, ‘Salva nos’. Save us. From what? Again, she turned, putting her back to the metal. The darkness howled back to its full strength, invading her thoughts like a plague. What had taken place upon this empty ship? Slain her crew and left her to drift, alone and abandoned? Striving for calm, she reviewed her orders and the information that Veradis had given them, but there were no answers. Only… only that they’d found no bodies. At least, not in the ship itself. Because… because they were all down here? Her nausea rose again, bitter in the back of her throat. A image of eyeless, rotting, bumping things came flooding into her mind, all bared bone and trailing wires and rancid, bloating flesh– Again, that splash, closer this time; she could see the ripples as they spread, hear them as they lapped gently against the column’s cold steel. Whatever it was, it was near. That nearness honed her fears down to a single, hard target – there! She moved towards the sound, her blade ready. And then, at last, she saw the faintest glimmering of the light. It came from above, from some walkway, impossibly high above her head, but it did not shine upon the bilge-water. There was something in the way. Something big. At first, she couldn’t make it out – it seemed like some huge, lumpish blur – but as she grew closer, she realised what it was. It was a pile, pointing roughly upwards at that glimmer of illumination. It was– She stopped, her mouth full of revulsion, her suitlight illuminating something grotesque: corpses, bloated, blank-faced and rotting. Hundreds of them. Even as she looked, craning up and up towards the light above, something fell and tumbled slowly down the side of the pile. It hit the water. Splash. Augusta stood there, transfixed. She could see the rotting insignias of the Xenia’s crew, and her mind struggled to find a prayer – for them, for herself – but her words were lost. Splash. She stepped closer, dagger still in hand. Where her suitlight shone, she could see pieces of faces almost intact – a young officer, barely more than a boy; a man in the rank remains of Ecclesiarchy robes; a servitor, rusted and still. Forsaken. By the rot of their remaining flesh, they’d all been dead some time. Then a deep growl of laughter made her turn. It was an ork. Just the one, and at first, Augusta struggled to believe what she was seeing. It was far bigger than she was, armour and all, a hulking, muscled monstrosity with a wide and toothy grin. But this one bore no metal – no augmetics or ornamentation of any kind, not a single shiny or reflective surface. And it was not green. In her suitlight, it looked… it looked purple. Seeing her raise her little dagger, it gave an audible snort and grinned wider. Shreds of flesh and fabric were still caught between its fangs. Forsaken. The fate of the Xenia’s crew… some of them must have been still alive, thrown down here in despair and desolation, knowing they had no escape, and waiting for the orks to… Her nerves spiked with revulsion. With fury. And this, she understood. She lunged and struck, her feet hampered by the water. Her blade struck the hollow of the beast’s throat, but the ork wore thick, grox-leather armour. Its grin broadened further. Her doubts, her fears, shattered. We beseech Thee, destroy them! Red-hot rage went through her – cleansing like fire. She raised her voice, sang the litany straight at the ork, heard the words ring back from the darkness as if the Xenia sang with her, finding its own faith and courage. She punched it, dagger between her fingers, full in the face. One eye popped and ran down its hide. Snarling, it pounced forwards. As the punches came in, she threw up her arms, blocking them as she had been taught. She was fast enough, but by the Light, the thing was immensely strong. It hammered at her with fists the size of rams, battering at her head and shoulders. One connected and her ears rang; the force of it snapped her neck over with a painful wrench. The hurt in her hips was climbing her spine like a live thing, all claws and spikes; she could feel something twanging, but she could not stop. Seeing a gap, she struck out with the dagger. It hit, but she might as well have been stabbing a training dummy. The ork snarled, pressing her back, into the pile of bodies behind her. If they fell… How many had died, thrown down here? Lost to the Light, and to their own faith? Watching as the orks ate their shipmates? Knowing they would be next? The thought fuelled her rage, and she surged forwards. She missed a block and the thing pummelled her faceplate. Missed another and one huge fist connected with her chest, sending her backwards with a crunch of crumpled armour. She kicked down at its knee, hard enough to break the bone. It growled and stumbled. Then it came back upright, and hit her with a full-charge body slam, its shoulder to her gut. They both went over, into the pile of dead. Her back wrenched, she gritted her teeth against a cry of pain. The corpses were a sliding cascade, a splashing avalanche of bodies that smothered her and the ork both. She struggled and rolled, found herself on her belly with the ork on top of her; she could see nothing but corpses, and the soup-thick mess of the bilge. The ork was upright first; it drove a knee into her back, hard. Pain exploded across her vision. It had a hand on her wrist, was trying to her wrench her armoured shoulder around and back. She struggled, almost crying aloud as her spine crunched with every motion. The thing was so powerful – how could it be so powerful? ‘Sister.’ The word was a hiss, laden with hate. ‘You – not so strong.’ This was not the ribald scorn of the foot-troops upstairs. This beast was something completely else, something dark and sharp and sinister. It said, ‘He – is not here. You die – hopeless.’ She got one arm under her, tried to push herself up. She reached for a prayer, for His courage and Light to fill her body, for the battle-rage that came with the song of His name, but there was no squad, and no harmony. She was alone. Bereft. No Sisters to sing His praises, no weapons to thunder His name… He – is not here. You die – hopeless. Forsaken. The ork drove its weight downwards, knee first. It was still wrenching at her arm. Impossibly, she heard the crack as her armour started to crumple. She must get back to her feet, stop this beast from killing and eating her… Salva nos! Her backplate cracked further. There was a whoosh as the seal gave, and the first freezing touch of the toxic water. She struggled furiously, but could not move. The ork paused, relishing the moment. She could almost hear it grin. Any second now, it would stamp down with its full weight and crush her back like a wet stick. And then… ‘There are times…’ her tutor’s words came back to her, ghosts in the dark, ‘…when He will test you. Pain, dread, death – all of these things are His blessing. And you will face them, Sisters, though they drag barbed hooks through the darkest corners of your soul. When you are at your lowest ebb, facing the very worst of your terrors… that is when He will be watching you.’ Was He here, now, closer than ever, down in these deep, dark depths? The thought was electric, a crackle of terror and energy. She remembered the lesson fully: that courage, like fear, comes from within. With a roar like pure, focused faith, she pushed with her free arm and went over sideways, rolling the ork beneath her armoured weight and shoving it under the water. Ignoring the pain, she flipped herself over and came down on its chest with both knees, whooshing the air from its lungs in a trail of exploding bubbles. It thrashed frantically, but she had it now, and the full weight of her body was keeping it under the water. With a prayer as sharp as the edge of the blade, she brought her punch-dagger down in the thing’s other eye. It spasmed, blood and fluid flowing through the water, but still it struggled on. She rammed the dagger in under its chin, driving it down with all the force she could muster and through the layer of armour. In nomine Eius! And – in His name – the thing, finally, went still. ‘You have faced quite the ordeal, Sister.’ Back on the observer’s deck, Veradis stood with folded arms and a severe expression. ‘For any Sororitas to fight alone in close quarters against an ork – truly, you have faced foe, fear and darkness, and you have been blessed by His strength.’ She raised an eyebrow. ‘However.’ The word had a knell of finality to it, and Augusta inhaled, making her back spike with pain. She said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The Sister Superior said nothing. Her armour, like Augusta’s, bore warmarks – clear signs that the squad had fought their way through to the muster point. At the Ritual of Cleansing, these would be beaten and polished, cleaned until the armour shone once more. In the field, they were badges of honour. Veradis continued, her tone flat. ‘You abandoned your squad, and returned without your weapon.’ Her lean, lined face did not change. ‘Such carelessness is unworthy of an Adepta Sororitas.’ The other members of the squad had closed around them, Lucienne with a brief smile for her friend. They were all ork-battered and sweating, but after Augusta’s ordeal, her feeling of being so lost and alone, she was thankful for every one of them – for their strength and faith, for their closeness and for how much she trusted them. Augusta lifted her chin. ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ ‘Recite for me,’ Veradis said, ‘the third stanza of the fourth book of the War Treatise of Saint Mina.’ Augusta knew the words, they were etched upon her mind and heart. She said, ‘We are Sisters beneath His light. We obey our orders without question. We do not falter. We do not fear. We do not err.’ ‘We do not err,’ Veradis repeated, making the point. ‘There is no excuse for such a lack of vigilance, Sister. We are a family, we work as Sisters should, and our trust in one another must be absolute. If you cannot uphold that trust, you betray yourself, your squad, your commander and your faith. I comprehend that you have faced horrors to return to us – climbing the pile of the dead to reach the light – but to betray the squad’s unity is to leave a hole in our defences. This cannot be borne.’ Augusta could respond only, ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Veradis nodded at her contrition. ‘You will undertake the remainder of this mission with your dagger alone. I have no bolter for you, and the combat discipline will serve as a timely reminder – to sharpen your senses, Sister. And to uphold your faith.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Augusta felt her face flush, but it was the only reply she could give. Veradis nodded again, her expression softening. ‘Yet, I comprehend what you have faced to return to us. In His name, and in the name of Saint Mina herself, Augusta, I am glad that you are back. I would hate to have lost your strong arm in this most forsaken of places.’ A flicker of a smile crossed her face. ‘See to your armour, Sister, and fear not the lumbering greenskin. We have a mission to complete.’",

      "content": "The great ship groaned. She hung in the void like a thing dead: a steel shell, gutted and creaking. No life stirred upon her gantries or gunnery decks, no figures knelt within her silent chapel. Her levels were dark, her lumens exhausted. And yet, somewhere in her cavernous depths, there glimmered suitlights. Six shifting circles of pale visibility shone out like search beams, glittering from the frost-cold steel of the walls. A squad of armoured warriors followed a walkway, single file. Though they walked slowly, their steps echoed in metallic ripples from the endless, empty mazes of corridors and conduits. And with them, there came the faintest glimmer of song. Domine, libra nos… Holding her place in the centre of the line, both hands on her bolter, Augusta Santorus raised the Litany of Battle alongside her Sisters, their harmonics like tendrils, unfurling through the chill. Ahead of her, Sister Superior Veradis moved at the front of the exploring squad, her bolt pistol in one hand and her auspex, its screen shimmering a dull green, in the other. From the lightning and the tempest… The litany was familiar, steadying. It flowed like shared strength between the six figures, their blood-scarlet armour all ceramite and plasteel, their cloaks black and white. Each one bore the embroidered symbol of the Bloody Rose, the Order Militant of the Adepta Sororitas dispatched to scout this floating corpse. Their mission, to look for survivors – and to protect the interests of the Ecclesiarchy, to whom this ship belonged. But, search though they might, the cruiser Santa Xenia hung silent, her carcass already rotting. ‘Keep the line tight.’ Veradis’ orders sounded quietly in the squad’s vox-beads. Amid the flow of the litany, the Sister Superior was listening. Our Emperor, deliver us… Behind Veradis, Augusta continued to sing, her voice weaving in with that of her Sisters. In the chapels and cathedrals of the schola on Ophelia VII, it was easy to perceive Him, standing stern and patient at prayer, or overseeing their combat training as they battled beneath His gaze. But here– The thought was unworthy and she silenced it, concentrating on the hymn. From plague, temptation and war… The litany was absolute: He was everywhere. As the squad moved down another metal stairway, past another layer of hatches and vents, so they raised His name, and His presence walked with them. Our Emperor, deliver us… Even here, down in the depths of this great, steel sepulchre. ‘I fear the spirit of this vessel is fading,’ Veradis said, her tone still quiet. ‘Yet the retention of her atmosphere and grav-field suggests that she may still be occupied. We will proceed along the lowest gantries, down towards the fusion reactor. If any spark of life remains, I suspect that is where we shall find it.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad returned their obedience, and Augusta followed the line as it turned through a T-junction and began to move lower. From the scourge of the Kraken… But still, she kept the hymn in her heart. The ambush was loud, and clumsy. They had descended two more levels, right down to the creaking, filthy access paths of the Xenia’s lowest helots. Pict screens set into terminals fizzled with white noise. They cast ghostly illumination on rust-flowering walls, and upon their own half-loose wiring, hanging like exposed nerves. Augusta’s red boot came down beside a fallen servo-skull. It grinned eyelessly back at her, mocking. ‘’Ware!’ The cry came from ahead, from Sister Leona. Instinctively, Augusta dropped to a combat-crouch, her bolter covering the corridor. In the narrow beams of the suitlights, she had an erratic, confused view of incoming motion: of muscle and steel; of bared, yellow fangs; of the eager, jagged glint of corroding augmetics. A second later, there came the thunderously red muzzle flash of Leona’s heavy bolter, opening to its full suppression. The noise was tremendous. Over the vox, Veradis gave orders, her tone calm: ‘Leona, lay down covering fire, keep them back.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us… The bolter hammered its song of war. The shapes stumbled, cursed, bellowed, fell. Voices bawled, coarse and mocking. There was an answering return of fire, and the smashing of melee weapons against metal armour. Explosions chewed up the corridor and ricocheted, sparking, from the walls. Water and refuse scattered under repeated impacts. ‘Emlyn!’ Veradis snapped. ‘Do you have contact?’ ‘Aye!’ At the rear of the squad, Sister Emlyn’s response was drowned out by another burst of bolter-fire – the ambush was converging from both ends. Beside Augusta, Sister Lucienne spat a curse – in the turmoil and the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The litany spilling from her like determination, Augusta came back upright, trying for a clear line of sight. Somewhere in the darkness, deep, tuneless voices launched into a squalid ditty, then scattered again, laughing. Orks. Augusta’s heart thumped in her chest. Orks had found the floating ship – scavengers, perhaps. The seethe of muscle and weapon took on form and comprehension, became shapes she recognised. She’d never seen an ork in the flesh, but she’d studied their images on the schola’s data-slates many times… she’d just never realised how big they were, how slavering and coarse. Her voice sang, furious and elated. Our Emperor, deliver us! They were xenos, invaders on an Ecclesiarchy ship. And they would die. She took a single shot over Emlyn’s shoulder, heard the squall as her carbide fusion matrix round bit into thick, green flesh. She heard Veradis ordering Leona to keep firing, and for the squad to advance, step by step, behind her cover. She heard Emlyn, the litany rising savagely from the rearmost Sister. She saw the whoosh of Sister Pia’s flamer, bathing the corridor in its sudden conflagration. She heard howls of pain and rage; she heard explosions, and the guttural derision of the orks’ voices. She heard one of her Sisters hiss with a sudden stab of agony, but she couldn’t tell who. ‘The corridor’s blocked with corpses!’ The voice was Leona’s. ‘We can go no further!’ ‘Gantry to the left,’ Veradis snapped. ‘We’ll get behind them!’ Augusta obeyed the order and ran. Behind her, Lucienne did the same, her armour gleaming in the firelight’s dance. They skidded, their footing slippery with spreading gore. The whole space seemed full of struggles and curses, of the bulk of muscle and metal. A huge, hoary hand grabbed for Augusta’s shoulder. She turned and put a round into the leering greenskin, then she was up the steps and out of its reach. ‘Throne!’ As they reached the gantry, Lucienne cursed again. ‘Where did they even come from?’ The last of the firelight flickered from a mess of struggling orks. They were undisciplined and rough, fighting amongst themselves now, all striving to get to the front. The biggest had a huge, notched axe, and it was hacking the smaller ones to pieces as it waded forwards. Even as it reached the steps, Veradis’ bolt pistol took it clean in the face, and it went over, bawling and kicking. The smaller ones were on it in a moment, enacting their bloody revenge. ‘Keep moving!’ The Sister Superior’s tone was grim. ‘And keep your vigilance, Sisters – there will be more!’ From the begetting of daemons… Red boots bashed along the walkway. The litany continued, fervent, tight with focus and rage. The orks were pausing now, abandoning their burned and their fallen. They seemed to be retreating, but they gave harsh, guttural snarls. ‘There will be more of them,’ Veradis said. ‘Now, move!’ The squad began to run. Corridor and gantry turned though a bend and became a steel bridge, suspended over a sheer, bottomless drop. Cold yawned at them from below, a dead breath from some vast and empty space, but Augusta paid it little attention – she was watching for more orks. Which was probably why she missed the gretchin completely. It was too small, too fast. With a high-pitched gibber, it hurled itself from the darkness, grappling for a hold. Startled, Augusta sent her shot wide. The thing hit her shoulders and faceplate, knocking her backwards; she grabbed at it with her free hand, striving to prise it free as it chittered and clawed, ramming its nimble fingers into the edges of her visor. She cursed, pulled, threw– But it was too late. Without realising, she’d taken another step back. She felt her heel go, tried to catch herself, made a belated grab for Lucienne’s outstretched hand… …missed it. Lucienne cried aloud, ‘Sister!’ In a split second of utter disbelief, Augusta realised she was falling, down, down, into the dark. Our Emperor, deliver us! Lucienne was shouting for Veradis, but the noise was already lost, too far above her to be possible. Incomprehension clamoured loud – she had no idea how she could have done something so foolish – then a steel girder caught her, slam, across the base of her spine. She grunted, scrabbled for a handhold, but her momentum turned her head over heels and dropped her, once more, into the depths of some utter, pitch-black nothing. By the–! She hit the bottom belly first, hard enough to rattle her teeth. Stunned, she lay there, tasting blood from a bitten tongue. She was half-immersed in the thick soup of the ship’s bilge, but she was alive, thank His grace and mercy; she was still breathing. Her hips hurt where she’d struck the girder, but her suit diagnostic was still showing full integrity. From the curse of the mutant… The litany in her heart like a prayer of gratitude, she pushed herself to her hands and knees, and looked round. She had no idea where she was. What? A spike of nervousness shot through her chest. She could see nothing, just the ripples of the water in an impenetrable cavern of black. The gleam of her suitlight was tiny, swallowed whole by the space around her. There was no light above her, no sign of her Sisters, no hint of the walkway from which she’d fallen. As she sat back on her heels, reaching for her bolter, a savage spasm of pain shot through her back. There was nothing broken, but she’d lost her weapon. Sudden adrenaline flashed; her hands searched frantically under the water. One of the schola’s earliest combat lessons: you never lost your bolter. It was a part of you, part of your faith and ordination. It was always in your hand, or fastened to your suit. A flicker of disappointment, like she’d let Him – let her squad and her training – down… But that thought felt like panic. She shoved it aside and tried the vox. The vox-channel was a crackling wasteland, devoid of life or hope. Just as if it, too, had no idea where she was. Our Emperor, deliver us… Slowly, holding the fear at bay, Augusta came to her feet. She drew the hidden punch-dagger from the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and took a full ten-second awareness check, turning slowly around. Nothing. Her mouth was filling with horror; her skin was shivering with chill… Nothing. A morte perpetua… Standing there, tiny and lost, she clung to dagger and litany like twin threads of pure hope. She prayed for His guidance, His strength, His light to bless her in this unknown darkness. She prayed for His forgiveness for her ridiculous blunder. And she remembered – forgiveness was only offered to those who fought on. She must focus. The one thing she knew: the Sisters’ muster point, back up at the observer deck. She must find a wall, and then a ladder. Once she was back up in the ship’s corridors, she could orient by their layout and numbering. She picked a direction and began to wade. The emptiness was vast, and absolute. Her hands constantly reaching for her bolter and coming back empty, Augusta moved through the ship’s belly like some tiny, squeaking thing, her position marked clearly by her suitlight and by the flowing arrowhead of ripples that pointed at her, wherever she went. In the viscous, filthy water, things bumped at her calves, almost as if they sought to harry her along. She swallowed her nausea, and forged past them. That thou wouldst bring them only death… She told herself: she knew this, knew the drill that came with it. She knew to conserve her water and rations, knew to set the beacon on her suit so her squad could detect the signal. But, like the orks, this had only ever been theory. A cruiser was a diagram on a data-slate, a tidy cutaway that bristled with clarity and labels. She knew where the observer deck was – it was up at the watch gallery, below the keel sail. But this…? She could not falter, it was not permitted. So she waded on, hard shocks of pain in her back with every step. She shone her little light as far as she could, but still, she found nothing; it was as if she’d been swallowed alive. She had no idea, even, if she was going the right way, or if she was just walking in circles. There were no labels down here, no handy descriptions – not as much as a magnetic field for her digi-compass. That thou shouldst spare none… But… she had no choice. She forced her way forwards through the water, searching with increasing fear for an edge, a way up, for anything that would bring the darkness back to a graspable size. And, as she pushed on, and on, and still on, and there was still nothing, the desolation of it began to spiral outwards from around her, vast and cold; it made her head spin and her breath catch like spikes in her throat. This could not be a ship; it was a scraping, groaning, rasping, lightless void, echoing with horror. The creaking was some endless, mournful cry; it crawled with unseen threats. It stretched around her like a thing eternal, like– Her chrono chimed the hour, and the faint, familiar song of bells echoed outwards over the water. It brought her back to herself and she stopped, holding her breath to listen. But still, nothing moved. Only the cold. Only the darkness. And only the things that bumped against her shins… By the Light! Where am I? What have I–? With a wrench of effort, she ground herself back into motion. She tried to keep praying, but the words were hollowing, now, and slowly, slowly, they bled from her like the dark was full of leeches. Her hand tightened on her dagger until her gauntleted fingers hurt. Soon, she began to hear other noises – noises like voices, like echoes of remembered hymns, like splashes in the limitless murk. Once, she thought she heard gunfire, and she almost ran in the direction of the sound, but it faded before she’d gone very far. The things in the water bumped and bumped at her; she had to stop herself shuddering and kicking back at them, shoving them away. Sometimes, her suitlight picked up odd gleams under the surface, as if some eyeless, deep-dwelling creature were baring its hungry teeth… How could there be no end to this? Surely, even if she were in the very bottom of the ship’s hull, there would be…? And then, she saw something. It was a support, a mighty, riveted pillar of steel that stretched upwards, high into the dark. It was pitch-black, utterly smooth and completely devoid of ladders, or of identification. It was ice-cold, glittering with frost. And it bore words. What? Augusta blinked, wondered if the darkness was playing some trick, but no, she was not seeing things. The words were like shadows in the pale chill; they looked like they’d been made with a finger. They said, ‘Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos’. The Emperor has forsaken us. Pure, stark cold went down her back. Forsaken. She turned, put her back to the metal and raised the dagger, but she could see nothing. Beyond her tiny suitlight, the darkness concealed a thousand eyes, a thousand questions. A thousand unseen tentacles uncoiled like Ruin from the water. Forsaken. What had happened to the ship? They had seen no sign of her crew, no signs of combat, not even bodies. She tried to tell herself that this was surely some lost crew member, scared and alone, but what if it wasn’t? What if the words had been written by something else? Something forsaken? She stayed where she was, her heart racing. Slowly, the ripples of her passage flattened and she watched the water, alert for any shine or swell. Again, she tried the vox, but it crackled at her, the noise filling her head and chest with static. Adrenaline screamed at her, told her to move – move! – but she could not. There was something out there. Something that knew exactly where she was. A thought came at her as if it were not her own, a tiny sliver of doubt in her adamantine faith. What if… What if He really had abandoned her? Punished her for her foolishness? She had no Sisters to guard her back, no bolter to slay her foe. Imperatoris meum dereliquit nos. Another splash, now closer, the noise unmistakeable… There really was something down here! Her blood thumped hard in her ears. She strained to hear past it. She was sure that, this time, the sound had been real, not the yammering of her doubts, not these monsters internal that threatened to undermine and betray her. She held the blade like a talisman, praying for His light, for His forgiveness. For His wisdom in the dark. Her every nerve shivered with– There! And another splash. The faintest of ripples, like a windless whisper across the black water’s surface. They teased at the very limits of her suitlight’s range. That thou shouldst pardon none… The litany came back to her in a flood, the words almost frantic. Her mind filled with the white fuzz of tension, her tongue seemed cleaved to the roof of her mouth. Doubts hammered at her heart like weapons… she struggled to force them down. She had fallen, disgraced herself. She had lost her bolter, an unthinkable sin. Forsaken. There was uncertainty in her heart and mind and chest, where there should be only strength and courage… Splash! Again. The noises were somewhere to her right. The sounds were too light for the heavy-booted orks, too slow for the gretchin. Her dread crystallised, shattered. I am Adepta Sororitas, and I fear nothing, not xenos, not heretic, not creature of Ruin… She closed her hand on the tiny blade, and forced herself to move. Her hips still spasmed with pain, but she followed the sounds. As she moved, the darkness seemed to shift about her like unheard laughter; it blew through her, mocking her weakness, and she strove to shut it out. She focused her mind on searching for markings or discrepancies, for anything that would tell her where she was. She had not gone much further before she found a second, colossal support and a second finger-mark, this one jagged with anger and pain, and much shorter. It said only, ‘Salva nos’. Save us. From what? Again, she turned, putting her back to the metal. The darkness howled back to its full strength, invading her thoughts like a plague. What had taken place upon this empty ship? Slain her crew and left her to drift, alone and abandoned? Striving for calm, she reviewed her orders and the information that Veradis had given them, but there were no answers. Only… only that they’d found no bodies. At least, not in the ship itself. Because… because they were all down here? Her nausea rose again, bitter in the back of her throat. A image of eyeless, rotting, bumping things came flooding into her mind, all bared bone and trailing wires and rancid, bloating flesh– Again, that splash, closer this time; she could see the ripples as they spread, hear them as they lapped gently against the column’s cold steel. Whatever it was, it was near. That nearness honed her fears down to a single, hard target – there! She moved towards the sound, her blade ready. And then, at last, she saw the faintest glimmering of the light. It came from above, from some walkway, impossibly high above her head, but it did not shine upon the bilge-water. There was something in the way. Something big. At first, she couldn’t make it out – it seemed like some huge, lumpish blur – but as she grew closer, she realised what it was. It was a pile, pointing roughly upwards at that glimmer of illumination. It was– She stopped, her mouth full of revulsion, her suitlight illuminating something grotesque: corpses, bloated, blank-faced and rotting. Hundreds of them. Even as she looked, craning up and up towards the light above, something fell and tumbled slowly down the side of the pile. It hit the water. Splash. Augusta stood there, transfixed. She could see the rotting insignias of the Xenia’s crew, and her mind struggled to find a prayer – for them, for herself – but her words were lost. Splash. She stepped closer, dagger still in hand. Where her suitlight shone, she could see pieces of faces almost intact – a young officer, barely more than a boy; a man in the rank remains of Ecclesiarchy robes; a servitor, rusted and still. Forsaken. By the rot of their remaining flesh, they’d all been dead some time. Then a deep growl of laughter made her turn. It was an ork. Just the one, and at first, Augusta struggled to believe what she was seeing. It was far bigger than she was, armour and all, a hulking, muscled monstrosity with a wide and toothy grin. But this one bore no metal – no augmetics or ornamentation of any kind, not a single shiny or reflective surface. And it was not green. In her suitlight, it looked… it looked purple. Seeing her raise her little dagger, it gave an audible snort and grinned wider. Shreds of flesh and fabric were still caught between its fangs. Forsaken. The fate of the Xenia’s crew… some of them must have been still alive, thrown down here in despair and desolation, knowing they had no escape, and waiting for the orks to… Her nerves spiked with revulsion. With fury. And this, she understood. She lunged and struck, her feet hampered by the water. Her blade struck the hollow of the beast’s throat, but the ork wore thick, grox-leather armour. Its grin broadened further. Her doubts, her fears, shattered. We beseech Thee, destroy them! Red-hot rage went through her – cleansing like fire. She raised her voice, sang the litany straight at the ork, heard the words ring back from the darkness as if the Xenia sang with her, finding its own faith and courage. She punched it, dagger between her fingers, full in the face. One eye popped and ran down its hide. Snarling, it pounced forwards. As the punches came in, she threw up her arms, blocking them as she had been taught. She was fast enough, but by the Light, the thing was immensely strong. It hammered at her with fists the size of rams, battering at her head and shoulders. One connected and her ears rang; the force of it snapped her neck over with a painful wrench. The hurt in her hips was climbing her spine like a live thing, all claws and spikes; she could feel something twanging, but she could not stop. Seeing a gap, she struck out with the dagger. It hit, but she might as well have been stabbing a training dummy. The ork snarled, pressing her back, into the pile of bodies behind her. If they fell… How many had died, thrown down here? Lost to the Light, and to their own faith? Watching as the orks ate their shipmates? Knowing they would be next? The thought fuelled her rage, and she surged forwards. She missed a block and the thing pummelled her faceplate. Missed another and one huge fist connected with her chest, sending her backwards with a crunch of crumpled armour. She kicked down at its knee, hard enough to break the bone. It growled and stumbled. Then it came back upright, and hit her with a full-charge body slam, its shoulder to her gut. They both went over, into the pile of dead. Her back wrenched, she gritted her teeth against a cry of pain. The corpses were a sliding cascade, a splashing avalanche of bodies that smothered her and the ork both. She struggled and rolled, found herself on her belly with the ork on top of her; she could see nothing but corpses, and the soup-thick mess of the bilge. The ork was upright first; it drove a knee into her back, hard. Pain exploded across her vision. It had a hand on her wrist, was trying to her wrench her armoured shoulder around and back. She struggled, almost crying aloud as her spine crunched with every motion. The thing was so powerful – how could it be so powerful? ‘Sister.’ The word was a hiss, laden with hate. ‘You – not so strong.’ This was not the ribald scorn of the foot-troops upstairs. This beast was something completely else, something dark and sharp and sinister. It said, ‘He – is not here. You die – hopeless.’ She got one arm under her, tried to push herself up. She reached for a prayer, for His courage and Light to fill her body, for the battle-rage that came with the song of His name, but there was no squad, and no harmony. She was alone. Bereft. No Sisters to sing His praises, no weapons to thunder His name… He – is not here. You die – hopeless. Forsaken. The ork drove its weight downwards, knee first. It was still wrenching at her arm. Impossibly, she heard the crack as her armour started to crumple. She must get back to her feet, stop this beast from killing and eating her… Salva nos! Her backplate cracked further. There was a whoosh as the seal gave, and the first freezing touch of the toxic water. She struggled furiously, but could not move. The ork paused, relishing the moment. She could almost hear it grin. Any second now, it would stamp down with its full weight and crush her back like a wet stick. And then… ‘There are times…’ her tutor’s words came back to her, ghosts in the dark, ‘…when He will test you. Pain, dread, death – all of these things are His blessing. And you will face them, Sisters, though they drag barbed hooks through the darkest corners of your soul. When you are at your lowest ebb, facing the very worst of your terrors… that is when He will be watching you.’ Was He here, now, closer than ever, down in these deep, dark depths? The thought was electric, a crackle of terror and energy. She remembered the lesson fully: that courage, like fear, comes from within. With a roar like pure, focused faith, she pushed with her free arm and went over sideways, rolling the ork beneath her armoured weight and shoving it under the water. Ignoring the pain, she flipped herself over and came down on its chest with both knees, whooshing the air from its lungs in a trail of exploding bubbles. It thrashed frantically, but she had it now, and the full weight of her body was keeping it under the water. With a prayer as sharp as the edge of the blade, she brought her punch-dagger down in the thing’s other eye. It spasmed, blood and fluid flowing through the water, but still it struggled on. She rammed the dagger in under its chin, driving it down with all the force she could muster and through the layer of armour. In nomine Eius! And – in His name – the thing, finally, went still. ‘You have faced quite the ordeal, Sister.’ Back on the observer’s deck, Veradis stood with folded arms and a severe expression. ‘For any Sororitas to fight alone in close quarters against an ork – truly, you have faced foe, fear and darkness, and you have been blessed by His strength.’ She raised an eyebrow. ‘However.’ The word had a knell of finality to it, and Augusta inhaled, making her back spike with pain. She said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The Sister Superior said nothing. Her armour, like Augusta’s, bore warmarks – clear signs that the squad had fought their way through to the muster point. At the Ritual of Cleansing, these would be beaten and polished, cleaned until the armour shone once more. In the field, they were badges of honour. Veradis continued, her tone flat. ‘You abandoned your squad, and returned without your weapon.’ Her lean, lined face did not change. ‘Such carelessness is unworthy of an Adepta Sororitas.’ The other members of the squad had closed around them, Lucienne with a brief smile for her friend. They were all ork-battered and sweating, but after Augusta’s ordeal, her feeling of being so lost and alone, she was thankful for every one of them – for their strength and faith, for their closeness and for how much she trusted them. Augusta lifted her chin. ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ ‘Recite for me,’ Veradis said, ‘the third stanza of the fourth book of the War Treatise of Saint Mina.’ Augusta knew the words, they were etched upon her mind and heart. She said, ‘We are Sisters beneath His light. We obey our orders without question. We do not falter. We do not fear. We do not err.’ ‘We do not err,’ Veradis repeated, making the point. ‘There is no excuse for such a lack of vigilance, Sister. We are a family, we work as Sisters should, and our trust in one another must be absolute. If you cannot uphold that trust, you betray yourself, your squad, your commander and your faith. I comprehend that you have faced horrors to return to us – climbing the pile of the dead to reach the light – but to betray the squad’s unity is to leave a hole in our defences. This cannot be borne.’ Augusta could respond only, ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Veradis nodded at her contrition. ‘You will undertake the remainder of this mission with your dagger alone. I have no bolter for you, and the combat discipline will serve as a timely reminder – to sharpen your senses, Sister. And to uphold your faith.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ Augusta felt her face flush, but it was the only reply she could give. Veradis nodded again, her expression softening. ‘Yet, I comprehend what you have faced to return to us. In His name, and in the name of Saint Mina herself, Augusta, I am glad that you are back. I would hate to have lost your strong arm in this most forsaken of places.’ A flicker of a smile crossed her face. ‘See to your armour, Sister, and fear not the lumbering greenskin. We have a mission to complete.’",

      "content": "Sister Augusta Santorus stood at the bottom of the wide stone steps, her scarlet armour gleaming, her head bared to the light. She had entrusted her weapons to the upheld tray of the little brass servitor and she carried only reverence and awe, as was proper in His presence. To bear arms in the house of the Emperor was blasphemy – after all, was His protection not enough? In a line to her left stood her Sisters, the squad’s black-and-white cloaks stirring faintly, though there was little wind in this carefully carved valley. Its rock walls were almost sheer and they glittered with crystalline fragments, reflecting the blue-green gleam of the planet above, hazed in its own atmosphere and glorious to behold. But that was not what held the Sisters’ attention. ‘Truly,’ Sister Superior Veradis said softly, from the centre of the line, ‘one finds His miracles in even the darkest of places. Sing with me, my Sisters…’ ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ They raised their voices in the litany, their harmonies echoing back at them, chiming from the rock. The acoustics were flawless, and Augusta felt a chill go down her back. The darkest of places… This was Caro, the smallest moon of the planet Lena Beta, orbiting its blue-white star. And upon its bleak, rocky surface, there stood a miracle. Forgotten for a thousand years, encased and defended by this carved, rock-walled gorge, it was a great, dark edifice, its bell towers and arches soaring over their heads. That much was imposing enough. But the cathedral was also black. Made from pure, black glass it was shadow, a cut-out, a great silhouette that took towering bites from the planet’s perfect curve. It was flat pane after flat pane, every one held in place by thin struts of dark flexsteel, every one glittering with myriad crystalline reflections. Warrior statues stood guard at its doorway, their strong faces bearing familiar fleur-de-lys tattoos, their carved armour bearing the mark of the Bloody Rose. From the very first days of their Order: their Sisters. Augusta wondered if they judged her, her newness and inexperience. Between the stone Sisters, the cathedral’s huge front doors stood open, and the squad could see that the building’s insides were also dark, lit only by the flickering, ruddy gleam of electro-sconces. Despite the gloom, however, the congregation already waited within. ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to an end, Veradis’ voice sounded in their vox-beads: ‘Witness our Sisters, Farus and Neva. The Accords of the Rose tell us that they defended this moon once before, a thousand years ago. Upon the site of their victory, and in the Emperor’s name, was this cathedral constructed. It is a true phenomenon, the only one of its kind.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Augusta was still staring, transfixed by the wonder that awaited them, nervous of making any misstep. ‘Stand ready,’ Veradis said. Ahead of them, the organ blasted the first notes of the hymn of greeting. ‘And move!’ The squad formed up, double file, and stamped crisply up the steps. Her boots ringing from the stone, the young Sister Augusta marched with her chin up, her gaze straight ahead. With a rustle, the congregation came to their feet, their dataslates in their hands and already flowing with the text of the hymn. The slates’ pale light reflected from the people’s faces and throats – dignitaries all, their robes and jewellery sparkling. Expectation rose from them like smoke. At the aisle’s far end, the great Sol-facing window was as black as everything else, its images lost to opacity. The altar was a great block of dark stone, the organ-pipes all but unseen in the shadows of the steel-supported roof. Only the pulpit and the choirstalls retained any glimmer of light, and, as the Sisters approached, so the choir took up the words of the hymn, their harmonies shiveringly perfect. The darkest of places. Beautiful, incredible though this was, something about this great building made Augusta tense – it provoked a sense of anticipation, almost, a feeling of huge expectation. The squad were here as an honour guard, marking its reconsecration, but still… In the pulpit, the deacon eyed her as if he could see her very thoughts. With a prayer for the unworthiness of the doubt, she lowered her gaze and remembered her humility. Nodding sternly, the deacon joined the hymn. Broadcast out through the vox-coder, his bass boom rose to the black glassaic roof, its power making Augusta’s arms prickle. It seemed almost as if the hymn would shatter the building asunder, bring it down in a tumble of glittering and sharp-edged fragments… Her tension grew sharper, whetted like a good blade. Levis est mihi! Show me the Light! They came to the altar rail, and spread out to kneel. Augusta’s blonde hair fell over her face, but even as it did so… ‘By the Throne!’ The soft exclamation came from Veradis – startling from the severe and disciplined Sister Superior. Before them, the very tip of the Sol window was touched with Lena’s rising light. Augusta stared, rapt. Slowly, the light spread down through the glassaic. And not only through the window; it pooled out through the walls, and across the great arched curve of the roof. It chased the darkness away, turning panes of shadow into panes of pure, blue-white light. Rainbows danced in the vaults of the ceiling; the ruddy gleam of the sconces paled as the pillars rippled with dazzling illumination. They had known to expect this – as this tiny moon curved about its planet, as the planet curved about its star, so this, its singular conjunction, came again. It was the only time in a thousand years that the light touched the bottom of this valley, the site of the previous battle, and the glassaic of the building it now contained. But still, the wonder of it…! Augusta knew she should lower her head, but she could not look away. Illumination flowed down through the great window, revealing Him in all His glory, His armour gleaming, His flaming blade upheld. The singing rose to a crescendo, a crashing celebration of His presence, and of the great victory that had taken place here. It carried a strong contralto line that picked up the thread of the Sisters’ own litany. Again, she shivered. She could not avert her gaze, she was transfixed – the light continued to spread, making the polished brass of the organ pipes shine. It made rainbow patterns slide down the aisle; it brought a gleam to the circling cherubim, their metal eyelids clicking as they surveyed the scene below. Overcome and breathless, bereft of the words of hymn and litany both, Augusta could only watch. The splintering of the roof took the Sisters completely by surprise. And the screams rang like music. ‘This will be a straightforward reconnaissance mission,’ Veradis had told them, in the back of the shuttle. ‘We are to attend the reconsecration of the great crystal cathedral, upon the mining moon Caro. The building is a true marvel, commemorating the victory of Sister Superior Farus against the xenos contagion that had infected Caro’s tunnels.’ She surveyed her squad, her expression stern. ‘You have studied your texts, I hope?’ The Arvus juddered as it hit the upper atmosphere. Sister Leona answered, ‘Most certainly. Caro has an odd, elliptical orbit about its planet, pulled back once every thousand years before being flung out into the void once more. Its resources, however, are considerable, and, after the Great Crusade, the planetary governor deemed it enough of a blessing to be mined for its gemstones. It has brought its planet great wealth.’ ‘Just so,’ Veradis said. The Arvus continued to shudder. Augusta, her helm between her knees, held onto her straps and prayed – this was never her favourite part of a mission. Sister Pia, the squad’s second, chimed in, reciting the text verbatim: ‘But lo! From the unsanctified places of the Emperor’s tunnels there came forth darkness unendurable, heresy manifest in claw and tooth, in hunger given form. And, though the humble servants of the Emperor’s mines gave battle with great bravery, the beasts were a seethe of cruelty beyond their ken, and thus, they were slain.’ Veradis nodded, approving. The pict screen in the back of the shuttle was showing the moon’s long orbit. ‘They survived long enough to call for help,’ Veradis said. ‘And Sister Superior Farus, may she rest in His grace, brought her squad to eliminate the menace. The crystal cathedral marks the site of our Sisters’ triumph, and the point at which the xenos infection was finally purged.’ Veradis paused, watching the pict screen and the slowly tumbling moon. ‘Caro’s atmosphere has been fully restored, and the mines will commence their formal reopen­ing once the service has taken place. We are to attend this service, and then undertake our reconnaissance mission. Needless to say, my Sisters, extreme vigilance must be maintained at all times.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ She gave Augusta a long look, ‘And no mistakes this time, Sister.’ Augusta looked at her red boots, shamed by the loss of her bolter on their previous mission. ‘I will make no errors.’ ‘Good.’ Veradis’ tone was grim. ‘His eyes will be upon you. As will mine.’ The shuttle’s juddering smoothed as the vehicle settled to a level flight path. On the screen, the orbit-image had given way to a close-up of the moon itself, riddled with a familiar pattern of mines, chimneys and manufactoria. Across the bottom of the screen flowed the necessary data – hours of daylight, atmospheric components, pollutant levels, air temperature. Next to Augusta, Sister Lucienne shot her a sideways look. Across their tight-beam vox-link she muttered, ‘Why do I bear a shadow in my heart, Sister? It is unworthy. And yet, there is something about this…’ Augusta glanced at her friend, but did not reply. The same shadow had crossed her also. The crash was tremendous. Glass splintered and tumbled, its edges glittering. A thousand dancing reflections spun across the shattered roof. People came to their feet, shocked, backing up… As a huge, dark shape crunched to the floor amid a smash of fallen shards. Instantly, reflexively, Augusta went for her bolter, but her gauntlet came back empty. Her heart pounding, she was on her feet, turning, drawing the small fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour. Around her, her Sisters were doing the same, each woman dropping to a guarded crouch. In the centre of the nave, a colossal, savage monster bared huge teeth at the fleeing congregation. The people were shrieking, now, gathering their robes and their families and scrambling out of the way. Panicking and shoving, they tumbled from its impact like ripples. By the Light! Augusta stared at it, her hand tightening on her blade. What is that? It was huge, pure savagery, and far bigger than the Sisters; its carapace was a glitter of spine-spiked darkness in the now brilliant rainbow light. It crouched, its tail lashing, whipping its head this way and that as it watched the fleeing, shrieking people. The hymn had tumbled from the air like a broken thing. In the pulpit, the deacon raged, leaning down to rant like fanatic. ‘This is the house of the Emperor! There will be no defilement here!’ He rounded on the Sisters, blazing zeal and fury, but Veradis was already moving. ‘Squad,’ she snapped into the vox. ‘With me, by twos, watch each other’s backs. Leona, get to the vestibule and secure the heavy bolter.’ Aloud, she roared, ‘Get out of the way!’ The people, already scrabbling, had no need to be told. As the Sisters closed ranks and began to move, the crowd was stumbling over the seating, tripping and crunching over the fallen glassaic. The braver amongst them had been trying to build some sort of hasty barricade, but it was a pitiful attempt – the thing’s claws were as long as a Sister’s forearm and they lashed a lethal left-right, sending pews and bodies flying. Snarling and screaming echoed loudly, the noises carrying as perfectly as the words of the hymn had done. ‘Sisters!’ Veradis barked the order aloud. ‘On the double!’ They broke into a run, their metal feet clanging a challenge. Each woman had her punch-dagger in her grip; in the lead, Veradis was using her free hand to pull the slower or less wary people clean out of her way. The litany came from her like pure, cold outrage. From the lightning and the tempest! The creature did not care. It was a boil of motion, a cyclone of violence. Its speed was terrifying. It was a harbinger of death, its tail like a whip, its claws ripping through flesh and stone alike. In a blur of speed, its huge maw bit at a fleeing dignitary. The man’s headless body ran another full step before it fell forwards, its ringed hands outstretched. Blood pooled from the neck. The creature pounced again, picking up a robed woman and tearing her clean in half. Shocked, horrified, her gorge rising with a toxic alloy of fury and nausea, Augusta almost skidded; she had to force herself to keep running, to maintain the litany’s defiant song. The people were almost all out of the way now, but the creature was already flanked by piles of flung bodies, some of them only injured, desperate and struggling. Ignoring them, focused now on the Sisters, it slashed through the nearest heap and jumped on a fallen pew, all spine and spike and tail, a knot of shoulders and claws. Its shining head turned towards Veradis and it extended a long tongue, tasting the air. For a split second, Augusta wondered if it was grinning at them. But this was no time for such whimsical nonsense. Our Emperor, deliver us! The floor was slick with scarlet; it steamed in the bright, crystal light, and wreathed the monster like an aura. ‘Xenos.’ Veradis’ snarl didn’t even sound surprised. ‘We do not fear you, creature.’ The thing tilted its head at her, almost as if it understood. From the pulpit, the deacon was still roaring: ‘Defiler! Slay it, Sister Superior, in the Emperor’s name!’ The creature leapt. Barehanded, bereft of both bolter and chainsword, Veradis did not hesitate. Fearless, she met it head-on, catching it as it leapt, and throwing it over and past her. It landed on its back, kicked frantically for a moment, and then righted itself. It spun snarling, lowering its head at them. ‘Go, get out!’ Behind Augusta, Sister Lucienne was ushering the last of the people, pushing them towards the two side doors that led back out to the cloisters, and to the high, tight walls of the valley. Horrified, their faces etched in terror and sickness, streaked by blood and tears, they followed her directions, pulling each other away. One of them, a young man barely older than Lucienne herself, clutched at her and said, ‘Why? What did we do to merit such punishment?’ ‘This is not punishment,’ she told him, her tone livid with suppressed outrage. ‘This is an abomination. And it will be purged!’ He nodded, though his eyes were as much glass as the great building itself. ‘Run!’ she told him. But Augusta had reached the fight. The thing was upright, all four arms mantled over its head; it was leering down at Veradis, its horrific teeth still bared. Augusta looked up at it, gauging its weapons, its weak points, its potential attacks. Images lashed at her, memories of the schola’s lessons – but she could never have guessed that such a beast would be this cold, this utterly pure and focused. And so fast! Snarling, it lunged at Veradis with each set of massive claws, left and right, one after the other. They tore through her armour as if it were only grox-leather, ripping huge parallel dents in her breastplate and pauldrons; but the Sister Superior was indomitable, she did not falter or fall back. Still singing, rage and battle and defiance, she slashed with the dagger, a sideways lunge aimed at the joints in the beast’s armoured belly. But it moved like a blur, too swift to see. Another set of claws slammed down on Veradis’ shoulder, sending her spinning to the floor. From plague, temptation and war! Over the vox, Sister Pia barked, ‘Spread out!’ The Sisters separated to surround the beast, coming at it from all sides. Its head twitched to and fro as it followed them, its tail lashed at their boots. Our Emperor, deliver us! The thing hissed at them. And then, almost faster than they could see, it exploded into motion. It was like fighting a tornado. Too strong, too many arms, too fast to follow. Glassaic crunched beneath their boots, the rainbow light still spreading over their heads – but they had no time to look up. One savage tail-lash took Lucienne off her feet, dropping her with a thunderous crash. A slash of claws sent Pia reeling, her armour sliced like cloth. The thing’s strength was enormous, its ferocity brutal. The Sisters came at it from every direction, but their daggers seemed to skitter off its carapace; it slashed and stuck at them, and their armour rent and ­buckled under blows too fast to follow. Pia lunged at its back, but it whipped around, lashing out with one huge arm to send her staggering back, slamming into the nearest pillar. As it did so, Augusta struck at its side but the thing’s hard chitin turned the point of her small dagger. The blow skidded, doing no harm. She swore under her breath, and kept singing. From the scourge of the Kraken! From the corner of her eye, she could see that Veradis was back on her feet, though the Sister Superior had not closed back into the melee. Instead, she had discarded her dagger and held her position, watching the monster, her eyes narrow. But Augusta could not stop to consider this – the thing whirled again, its tail knocking Lucienne flying for a second time. Its gleaming, foot-long teeth snapped at Augusta’s arm; its claws lashed hard at her cheek. She yanked her head backwards and it missed her, but only just. She felt the whack of wind as they passed within a whisper of her nose. If those claws caught her, they would take her face clean off. It followed the attack and leapt at her – one slash, and another, and another, each one slamming into her and making her reel. She raised her arms to defend herself; her ears rang with song and fury. The Sisters followed it, pressing in close, stopping the thing moving, preventing it getting away. Blades struck at it from all sides, but its arms were fast, knocking them aside, sending the squad skidding backwards, their boots screeching on the stone. Without their bolters they had nothing that could touch it, and it was almost as if it knew. Amid its chilling focus, it seemed to be mocking them. The deacon was still shouting from the pulpit, almost frothing at the mouth. Augusta lunged again, hard enough to stick her dagger point first into the beast’s chest, but she lost her grip on the weapon as the monster whipped around. It turned too fast, taking the blade with it. It snapped its teeth downwards at Pia’s shoulder. For an instant, they crunched on ceramite, then Pia dropped to one knee and they slammed shut on air. An instant later, Pia was back on her feet, her song twisting into a vicious, stubborn curse. How could they stop this thing? Panic was beginning to swell in Augusta’s chest, though she would not succumb to it. How was this accursed thing even here? Our Emperor, deliver us! Beside her, Sister Pia raised the litany once more. Clenching her gauntleted fists, Augusta closed again – but the beast barely even noticed. She might as well have been hitting the rock wall. Then she saw her dagger, sticking from the thing’s carapace. She made a grab for it, catching it and pulling it free. Snarling, the beast whirled again. It hurled itself straight at her, its teeth bared, all four sets of claws coming for her chest. She threw up her arms in a cross block, felt the force of its impact through her elbows and shoulders, but she could not stand in its path, it was just too big. It smashed her to the floor, hurled itself past her and spun, turning back to the squad. Another claw strike, a reaching left-right, and Sister Lucienne was falling, dark fluid staining the rips in her armour. In His name! You will not do this! Sister Emlyn leaned down and pulled Lucienne out of the way. Augusta kept striking, slashing, singing, distracting its attention. How was it here? Had it always been here, surviving a thousand years from the previous battle? Had it been waiting, hiding somewhere outside this valley, just waiting for the… Waiting for the light. By the Throne! The realisation struck her like a claw. Of course. It had been here all along, dormant, curled about itself in patient stillness, and the very conjunction that had brought life and light back to the cathedral – it had touched this thing, and roused it from its stasis. Had brought it, leaping, and tearing, and hungry, into their midst. Furious at its sacrilege, at its presence, at the memory of their Sisters that it had now despoiled, she threw herself at it. The squad moved with her, all of them closing once more about its flanks. Over the vox, Veradis barked, ‘Pia! Now!’ ‘Aye.’ Her movements absolutely precise, Sister Pia grabbed the thing’s extended tongue in one red-gauntleted hand. With a single, deft twist, she wrapped it around her wrist and brought its head down into her raised knee. There was a sharp crack, and its teeth closed on its own flesh. Gore and squeals spurted from its mouth. The Sister Superior roared, ‘Leona! Fire!’ From the far side of the now empty nave came the unmistakeable metallic cocking of the heavy bolter. Veradis bawled, ‘Down!’ Augusta was moving, even as the Sister Superior wrapped an arm over her shoulders. They crashed to the floor together. The thunder was tremendous. A full directed burst roared across the air. It cut though the pews, through the glassaic, and though the chitinous hide of the monster. The heavy bolter boomed its song of death, the noise immense. White-light panes shattered as rounds blew them outwards. On the floor, face down on the glass-pebbled stone and half-crushed by Veradis’ weight, Augusta couldn’t see – but she could hear the creature scream in pain and fury, hear it thrashing as the rounds bit home. She heard its claws as it turned and ran, hurling itself bodily across the nave and towards Leona. But Leona was still firing, steady and unintimidated. Her voice over the vox sang defiance. Bring them only death! Veradis shifted, was back on her feet. Augusta, too, started to stand up. From out of the corner of her eye she saw Luci­enne, bloodied and battered and rolling back to her knees; saw Sister Emlyn, shaking herself, but moving. Saw Sister Pia, lying curled on her side, blood sliding from her mouth, her armour smoking from multiple holes. What? Only one weapon made scars like those. In the vestibule, the heavy bolter was still firing, its muzzle tracking the incoming beast. Leona had stepped back, given herself the full range and rate of fire; the monster was spraying thick, dark blood, shuddering under the onslaught, but it was still coming, climbing over the pews as if nothing could bring it down… But Sister Pia lay still. Facing the monster, Leona was still singing, her voice rising as the thing closed on her; she was back to the wall, now, had nowhere else to go. The deacon was still in his pulpit, still bellowing orders… But Sister Pia lay still. Stunned, Augusta watched as the heavy bolter started to cough. Leona swore, knowing she was down to her last few rounds, but she still kept firing as the monster skidded the last pews out of its way… But Sister Pia lay still. ‘By the Throne.’ Over the vox, Leona cursed aloud. ‘You’ll go down if I have to beat you to death myself!’ With a final rumble, the heavy bolter clacked loudly, and stopped. The silence was suddenly tremendous, echoing in Augusta’s ears. But – finally – the monster was down. Barely two feet from where Leona was standing, it had crashed to the floor, its chitin cracked, its arms splayed, its body coated in its own fluids. Its rear claws kicked once, and were still. The deacon cried, ‘Yes! Thank the Emperor!’ but they did not look up at him. Because Sister Pia lay still. Calmly, Veradis said, ‘Be sure, Leona.’ Her voice was full – victory, sacrifice, sadness. ‘Aye.’ Boots sounded as Leona walked over to the thing, her heavy bolter still in her hands. The single shot to its skull rang out like the last line of a hymn. ‘One round left in the chamber,’ she said, quietly. Like the presence of their small, hidden daggers, no one needed to ask her why it was there. But Sister Pia had not moved. ‘Her death was not your doing,’ Veradis said, one hand on Sister Leona’s shoulder. ‘It was a risk, and Sister Pia understood. We fight as the Emperor decrees.’ Leona’s lean, lined face was stone hard, her chin lifted, as if she kept any emotions to herself. At their feet, Sister Pia lay crumpled upon a bed of ­shattered glassaic, her black hair spread out, her expression frozen in the bared-teeth determination of pure combat. All down one side of her armour there were the telltale holes made by the heavy bolter. Her courage had enabled them to injure the beast, and had forced it to react to the weapon, rather than killing the rest of the squad. They – and the people – owed Pia their lives. Augusta knew that sacrifice was the greatest honour to which a Sister could aspire, but she had never before seen it in the field, and she stayed silent, looking down at Pia’s fallen form. She seemed so small. Veradis, however, was glaring at the deacon. ‘You declared this location secure.’ It was not a question. The deacon had not lost his pompousness. He was a small, round man, and he puffed himself up before answering: ‘How was I to know that your long-lost Sisters had not purged this moon completely? The failure is yours, Sororitas, not mine.’ Veradis eyed him as if she would break him in half, but said nothing. Instead, she said to the squad, ‘Retrieve your weapons. I want every doorway guarded. There will be no service here until we deploy fully through the tunnels and ensure that there are no further,’ she eyed the deacon, ‘surprises.’ ‘Aye.’ The Sisters did as they were ordered, but Augusta paused, Lucienne beside her. ‘Sister Superior, a question, if I may?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘This is the house of the Emperor. We do not bear weapons–’ ‘You’re asking why He did not defend us, Sister?’ Veradis’ tone held a certain wry amusement, perhaps at Augusta’s inexperience. ‘As the Scriptures would have us believe?’ Feeling the gazes of both deacon and Sister Superior, Augusta looked down at Pia’s fallen body and nodded. ‘Is that so foolish a question? How could such a creature be permitted…’ The deacon glowered at her. ‘He does not come when you call, Sister…’ Veradis held up a hand, and he quietened, tapping his foot. The Sister Superior said, ‘The xenos knows no respect. And what are we but His defence? What are we but His weapons? Twice now, you have faced foes without your bolter, and twice, you have triumphed. This is a test of our faith and mettle, like any other, wherever it may take place.’ Augusta stole a look at the now shining window, remembering the stone Sisters that stood at the doorway. ‘Our Sisters did not fail?’ ‘That is not for us to judge.’ Veradis shot the deacon a sideways glare. ‘We only do as we are bid, by His presence. You may grieve for Sister Pia, in the proper time, but you must first follow your orders.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Have no fear,’ Veradis said, her face softening to a rare smile. ‘Sister Pia stands before the Throne, and she does so in honour, her life given in battle.’ She glanced at the fallen creature, drawing Augusta’s attention and making the point. ‘We can only pray that, one day, we will be so blessed.’",

      "content": "Sister Augusta Santorus stood at the bottom of the wide stone steps, her scarlet armour gleaming, her head bared to the light. She had entrusted her weapons to the upheld tray of the little brass servitor and she carried only reverence and awe, as was proper in His presence. To bear arms in the house of the Emperor was blasphemy – after all, was His protection not enough? In a line to her left stood her Sisters, the squad’s black-and-white cloaks stirring faintly, though there was little wind in this carefully carved valley. Its rock walls were almost sheer and they glittered with crystalline fragments, reflecting the blue-green gleam of the planet above, hazed in its own atmosphere and glorious to behold. But that was not what held the Sisters’ attention. ‘Truly,’ Sister Superior Veradis said softly, from the centre of the line, ‘one finds His miracles in even the darkest of places. Sing with me, my Sisters…’ ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ They raised their voices in the litany, their harmonies echoing back at them, chiming from the rock. The acoustics were flawless, and Augusta felt a chill go down her back. The darkest of places… This was Caro, the smallest moon of the planet Lena Beta, orbiting its blue-white star. And upon its bleak, rocky surface, there stood a miracle. Forgotten for a thousand years, encased and defended by this carved, rock-walled gorge, it was a great, dark edifice, its bell towers and arches soaring over their heads. That much was imposing enough. But the cathedral was also black. Made from pure, black glass it was shadow, a cut-out, a great silhouette that took towering bites from the planet’s perfect curve. It was flat pane after flat pane, every one held in place by thin struts of dark flexsteel, every one glittering with myriad crystalline reflections. Warrior statues stood guard at its doorway, their strong faces bearing familiar fleur-de-lys tattoos, their carved armour bearing the mark of the Bloody Rose. From the very first days of their Order: their Sisters. Augusta wondered if they judged her, her newness and inexperience. Between the stone Sisters, the cathedral’s huge front doors stood open, and the squad could see that the building’s insides were also dark, lit only by the flickering, ruddy gleam of electro-sconces. Despite the gloom, however, the congregation already waited within. ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to an end, Veradis’ voice sounded in their vox-beads: ‘Witness our Sisters, Farus and Neva. The Accords of the Rose tell us that they defended this moon once before, a thousand years ago. Upon the site of their victory, and in the Emperor’s name, was this cathedral constructed. It is a true phenomenon, the only one of its kind.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Augusta was still staring, transfixed by the wonder that awaited them, nervous of making any misstep. ‘Stand ready,’ Veradis said. Ahead of them, the organ blasted the first notes of the hymn of greeting. ‘And move!’ The squad formed up, double file, and stamped crisply up the steps. Her boots ringing from the stone, the young Sister Augusta marched with her chin up, her gaze straight ahead. With a rustle, the congregation came to their feet, their dataslates in their hands and already flowing with the text of the hymn. The slates’ pale light reflected from the people’s faces and throats – dignitaries all, their robes and jewellery sparkling. Expectation rose from them like smoke. At the aisle’s far end, the great Sol-facing window was as black as everything else, its images lost to opacity. The altar was a great block of dark stone, the organ-pipes all but unseen in the shadows of the steel-supported roof. Only the pulpit and the choirstalls retained any glimmer of light, and, as the Sisters approached, so the choir took up the words of the hymn, their harmonies shiveringly perfect. The darkest of places. Beautiful, incredible though this was, something about this great building made Augusta tense – it provoked a sense of anticipation, almost, a feeling of huge expectation. The squad were here as an honour guard, marking its reconsecration, but still… In the pulpit, the deacon eyed her as if he could see her very thoughts. With a prayer for the unworthiness of the doubt, she lowered her gaze and remembered her humility. Nodding sternly, the deacon joined the hymn. Broadcast out through the vox-coder, his bass boom rose to the black glassaic roof, its power making Augusta’s arms prickle. It seemed almost as if the hymn would shatter the building asunder, bring it down in a tumble of glittering and sharp-edged fragments… Her tension grew sharper, whetted like a good blade. Levis est mihi! Show me the Light! They came to the altar rail, and spread out to kneel. Augusta’s blonde hair fell over her face, but even as it did so… ‘By the Throne!’ The soft exclamation came from Veradis – startling from the severe and disciplined Sister Superior. Before them, the very tip of the Sol window was touched with Lena’s rising light. Augusta stared, rapt. Slowly, the light spread down through the glassaic. And not only through the window; it pooled out through the walls, and across the great arched curve of the roof. It chased the darkness away, turning panes of shadow into panes of pure, blue-white light. Rainbows danced in the vaults of the ceiling; the ruddy gleam of the sconces paled as the pillars rippled with dazzling illumination. They had known to expect this – as this tiny moon curved about its planet, as the planet curved about its star, so this, its singular conjunction, came again. It was the only time in a thousand years that the light touched the bottom of this valley, the site of the previous battle, and the glassaic of the building it now contained. But still, the wonder of it…! Augusta knew she should lower her head, but she could not look away. Illumination flowed down through the great window, revealing Him in all His glory, His armour gleaming, His flaming blade upheld. The singing rose to a crescendo, a crashing celebration of His presence, and of the great victory that had taken place here. It carried a strong contralto line that picked up the thread of the Sisters’ own litany. Again, she shivered. She could not avert her gaze, she was transfixed – the light continued to spread, making the polished brass of the organ pipes shine. It made rainbow patterns slide down the aisle; it brought a gleam to the circling cherubim, their metal eyelids clicking as they surveyed the scene below. Overcome and breathless, bereft of the words of hymn and litany both, Augusta could only watch. The splintering of the roof took the Sisters completely by surprise. And the screams rang like music. ‘This will be a straightforward reconnaissance mission,’ Veradis had told them, in the back of the shuttle. ‘We are to attend the reconsecration of the great crystal cathedral, upon the mining moon Caro. The building is a true marvel, commemorating the victory of Sister Superior Farus against the xenos contagion that had infected Caro’s tunnels.’ She surveyed her squad, her expression stern. ‘You have studied your texts, I hope?’ The Arvus juddered as it hit the upper atmosphere. Sister Leona answered, ‘Most certainly. Caro has an odd, elliptical orbit about its planet, pulled back once every thousand years before being flung out into the void once more. Its resources, however, are considerable, and, after the Great Crusade, the planetary governor deemed it enough of a blessing to be mined for its gemstones. It has brought its planet great wealth.’ ‘Just so,’ Veradis said. The Arvus continued to shudder. Augusta, her helm between her knees, held onto her straps and prayed – this was never her favourite part of a mission. Sister Pia, the squad’s second, chimed in, reciting the text verbatim: ‘But lo! From the unsanctified places of the Emperor’s tunnels there came forth darkness unendurable, heresy manifest in claw and tooth, in hunger given form. And, though the humble servants of the Emperor’s mines gave battle with great bravery, the beasts were a seethe of cruelty beyond their ken, and thus, they were slain.’ Veradis nodded, approving. The pict screen in the back of the shuttle was showing the moon’s long orbit. ‘They survived long enough to call for help,’ Veradis said. ‘And Sister Superior Farus, may she rest in His grace, brought her squad to eliminate the menace. The crystal cathedral marks the site of our Sisters’ triumph, and the point at which the xenos infection was finally purged.’ Veradis paused, watching the pict screen and the slowly tumbling moon. ‘Caro’s atmosphere has been fully restored, and the mines will commence their formal reopen­ing once the service has taken place. We are to attend this service, and then undertake our reconnaissance mission. Needless to say, my Sisters, extreme vigilance must be maintained at all times.’ ‘Yes, Sister Superior.’ She gave Augusta a long look, ‘And no mistakes this time, Sister.’ Augusta looked at her red boots, shamed by the loss of her bolter on their previous mission. ‘I will make no errors.’ ‘Good.’ Veradis’ tone was grim. ‘His eyes will be upon you. As will mine.’ The shuttle’s juddering smoothed as the vehicle settled to a level flight path. On the screen, the orbit-image had given way to a close-up of the moon itself, riddled with a familiar pattern of mines, chimneys and manufactoria. Across the bottom of the screen flowed the necessary data – hours of daylight, atmospheric components, pollutant levels, air temperature. Next to Augusta, Sister Lucienne shot her a sideways look. Across their tight-beam vox-link she muttered, ‘Why do I bear a shadow in my heart, Sister? It is unworthy. And yet, there is something about this…’ Augusta glanced at her friend, but did not reply. The same shadow had crossed her also. The crash was tremendous. Glass splintered and tumbled, its edges glittering. A thousand dancing reflections spun across the shattered roof. People came to their feet, shocked, backing up… As a huge, dark shape crunched to the floor amid a smash of fallen shards. Instantly, reflexively, Augusta went for her bolter, but her gauntlet came back empty. Her heart pounding, she was on her feet, turning, drawing the small fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour. Around her, her Sisters were doing the same, each woman dropping to a guarded crouch. In the centre of the nave, a colossal, savage monster bared huge teeth at the fleeing congregation. The people were shrieking, now, gathering their robes and their families and scrambling out of the way. Panicking and shoving, they tumbled from its impact like ripples. By the Light! Augusta stared at it, her hand tightening on her blade. What is that? It was huge, pure savagery, and far bigger than the Sisters; its carapace was a glitter of spine-spiked darkness in the now brilliant rainbow light. It crouched, its tail lashing, whipping its head this way and that as it watched the fleeing, shrieking people. The hymn had tumbled from the air like a broken thing. In the pulpit, the deacon raged, leaning down to rant like fanatic. ‘This is the house of the Emperor! There will be no defilement here!’ He rounded on the Sisters, blazing zeal and fury, but Veradis was already moving. ‘Squad,’ she snapped into the vox. ‘With me, by twos, watch each other’s backs. Leona, get to the vestibule and secure the heavy bolter.’ Aloud, she roared, ‘Get out of the way!’ The people, already scrabbling, had no need to be told. As the Sisters closed ranks and began to move, the crowd was stumbling over the seating, tripping and crunching over the fallen glassaic. The braver amongst them had been trying to build some sort of hasty barricade, but it was a pitiful attempt – the thing’s claws were as long as a Sister’s forearm and they lashed a lethal left-right, sending pews and bodies flying. Snarling and screaming echoed loudly, the noises carrying as perfectly as the words of the hymn had done. ‘Sisters!’ Veradis barked the order aloud. ‘On the double!’ They broke into a run, their metal feet clanging a challenge. Each woman had her punch-dagger in her grip; in the lead, Veradis was using her free hand to pull the slower or less wary people clean out of her way. The litany came from her like pure, cold outrage. From the lightning and the tempest! The creature did not care. It was a boil of motion, a cyclone of violence. Its speed was terrifying. It was a harbinger of death, its tail like a whip, its claws ripping through flesh and stone alike. In a blur of speed, its huge maw bit at a fleeing dignitary. The man’s headless body ran another full step before it fell forwards, its ringed hands outstretched. Blood pooled from the neck. The creature pounced again, picking up a robed woman and tearing her clean in half. Shocked, horrified, her gorge rising with a toxic alloy of fury and nausea, Augusta almost skidded; she had to force herself to keep running, to maintain the litany’s defiant song. The people were almost all out of the way now, but the creature was already flanked by piles of flung bodies, some of them only injured, desperate and struggling. Ignoring them, focused now on the Sisters, it slashed through the nearest heap and jumped on a fallen pew, all spine and spike and tail, a knot of shoulders and claws. Its shining head turned towards Veradis and it extended a long tongue, tasting the air. For a split second, Augusta wondered if it was grinning at them. But this was no time for such whimsical nonsense. Our Emperor, deliver us! The floor was slick with scarlet; it steamed in the bright, crystal light, and wreathed the monster like an aura. ‘Xenos.’ Veradis’ snarl didn’t even sound surprised. ‘We do not fear you, creature.’ The thing tilted its head at her, almost as if it understood. From the pulpit, the deacon was still roaring: ‘Defiler! Slay it, Sister Superior, in the Emperor’s name!’ The creature leapt. Barehanded, bereft of both bolter and chainsword, Veradis did not hesitate. Fearless, she met it head-on, catching it as it leapt, and throwing it over and past her. It landed on its back, kicked frantically for a moment, and then righted itself. It spun snarling, lowering its head at them. ‘Go, get out!’ Behind Augusta, Sister Lucienne was ushering the last of the people, pushing them towards the two side doors that led back out to the cloisters, and to the high, tight walls of the valley. Horrified, their faces etched in terror and sickness, streaked by blood and tears, they followed her directions, pulling each other away. One of them, a young man barely older than Lucienne herself, clutched at her and said, ‘Why? What did we do to merit such punishment?’ ‘This is not punishment,’ she told him, her tone livid with suppressed outrage. ‘This is an abomination. And it will be purged!’ He nodded, though his eyes were as much glass as the great building itself. ‘Run!’ she told him. But Augusta had reached the fight. The thing was upright, all four arms mantled over its head; it was leering down at Veradis, its horrific teeth still bared. Augusta looked up at it, gauging its weapons, its weak points, its potential attacks. Images lashed at her, memories of the schola’s lessons – but she could never have guessed that such a beast would be this cold, this utterly pure and focused. And so fast! Snarling, it lunged at Veradis with each set of massive claws, left and right, one after the other. They tore through her armour as if it were only grox-leather, ripping huge parallel dents in her breastplate and pauldrons; but the Sister Superior was indomitable, she did not falter or fall back. Still singing, rage and battle and defiance, she slashed with the dagger, a sideways lunge aimed at the joints in the beast’s armoured belly. But it moved like a blur, too swift to see. Another set of claws slammed down on Veradis’ shoulder, sending her spinning to the floor. From plague, temptation and war! Over the vox, Sister Pia barked, ‘Spread out!’ The Sisters separated to surround the beast, coming at it from all sides. Its head twitched to and fro as it followed them, its tail lashed at their boots. Our Emperor, deliver us! The thing hissed at them. And then, almost faster than they could see, it exploded into motion. It was like fighting a tornado. Too strong, too many arms, too fast to follow. Glassaic crunched beneath their boots, the rainbow light still spreading over their heads – but they had no time to look up. One savage tail-lash took Lucienne off her feet, dropping her with a thunderous crash. A slash of claws sent Pia reeling, her armour sliced like cloth. The thing’s strength was enormous, its ferocity brutal. The Sisters came at it from every direction, but their daggers seemed to skitter off its carapace; it slashed and stuck at them, and their armour rent and ­buckled under blows too fast to follow. Pia lunged at its back, but it whipped around, lashing out with one huge arm to send her staggering back, slamming into the nearest pillar. As it did so, Augusta struck at its side but the thing’s hard chitin turned the point of her small dagger. The blow skidded, doing no harm. She swore under her breath, and kept singing. From the scourge of the Kraken! From the corner of her eye, she could see that Veradis was back on her feet, though the Sister Superior had not closed back into the melee. Instead, she had discarded her dagger and held her position, watching the monster, her eyes narrow. But Augusta could not stop to consider this – the thing whirled again, its tail knocking Lucienne flying for a second time. Its gleaming, foot-long teeth snapped at Augusta’s arm; its claws lashed hard at her cheek. She yanked her head backwards and it missed her, but only just. She felt the whack of wind as they passed within a whisper of her nose. If those claws caught her, they would take her face clean off. It followed the attack and leapt at her – one slash, and another, and another, each one slamming into her and making her reel. She raised her arms to defend herself; her ears rang with song and fury. The Sisters followed it, pressing in close, stopping the thing moving, preventing it getting away. Blades struck at it from all sides, but its arms were fast, knocking them aside, sending the squad skidding backwards, their boots screeching on the stone. Without their bolters they had nothing that could touch it, and it was almost as if it knew. Amid its chilling focus, it seemed to be mocking them. The deacon was still shouting from the pulpit, almost frothing at the mouth. Augusta lunged again, hard enough to stick her dagger point first into the beast’s chest, but she lost her grip on the weapon as the monster whipped around. It turned too fast, taking the blade with it. It snapped its teeth downwards at Pia’s shoulder. For an instant, they crunched on ceramite, then Pia dropped to one knee and they slammed shut on air. An instant later, Pia was back on her feet, her song twisting into a vicious, stubborn curse. How could they stop this thing? Panic was beginning to swell in Augusta’s chest, though she would not succumb to it. How was this accursed thing even here? Our Emperor, deliver us! Beside her, Sister Pia raised the litany once more. Clenching her gauntleted fists, Augusta closed again – but the beast barely even noticed. She might as well have been hitting the rock wall. Then she saw her dagger, sticking from the thing’s carapace. She made a grab for it, catching it and pulling it free. Snarling, the beast whirled again. It hurled itself straight at her, its teeth bared, all four sets of claws coming for her chest. She threw up her arms in a cross block, felt the force of its impact through her elbows and shoulders, but she could not stand in its path, it was just too big. It smashed her to the floor, hurled itself past her and spun, turning back to the squad. Another claw strike, a reaching left-right, and Sister Lucienne was falling, dark fluid staining the rips in her armour. In His name! You will not do this! Sister Emlyn leaned down and pulled Lucienne out of the way. Augusta kept striking, slashing, singing, distracting its attention. How was it here? Had it always been here, surviving a thousand years from the previous battle? Had it been waiting, hiding somewhere outside this valley, just waiting for the… Waiting for the light. By the Throne! The realisation struck her like a claw. Of course. It had been here all along, dormant, curled about itself in patient stillness, and the very conjunction that had brought life and light back to the cathedral – it had touched this thing, and roused it from its stasis. Had brought it, leaping, and tearing, and hungry, into their midst. Furious at its sacrilege, at its presence, at the memory of their Sisters that it had now despoiled, she threw herself at it. The squad moved with her, all of them closing once more about its flanks. Over the vox, Veradis barked, ‘Pia! Now!’ ‘Aye.’ Her movements absolutely precise, Sister Pia grabbed the thing’s extended tongue in one red-gauntleted hand. With a single, deft twist, she wrapped it around her wrist and brought its head down into her raised knee. There was a sharp crack, and its teeth closed on its own flesh. Gore and squeals spurted from its mouth. The Sister Superior roared, ‘Leona! Fire!’ From the far side of the now empty nave came the unmistakeable metallic cocking of the heavy bolter. Veradis bawled, ‘Down!’ Augusta was moving, even as the Sister Superior wrapped an arm over her shoulders. They crashed to the floor together. The thunder was tremendous. A full directed burst roared across the air. It cut though the pews, through the glassaic, and though the chitinous hide of the monster. The heavy bolter boomed its song of death, the noise immense. White-light panes shattered as rounds blew them outwards. On the floor, face down on the glass-pebbled stone and half-crushed by Veradis’ weight, Augusta couldn’t see – but she could hear the creature scream in pain and fury, hear it thrashing as the rounds bit home. She heard its claws as it turned and ran, hurling itself bodily across the nave and towards Leona. But Leona was still firing, steady and unintimidated. Her voice over the vox sang defiance. Bring them only death! Veradis shifted, was back on her feet. Augusta, too, started to stand up. From out of the corner of her eye she saw Luci­enne, bloodied and battered and rolling back to her knees; saw Sister Emlyn, shaking herself, but moving. Saw Sister Pia, lying curled on her side, blood sliding from her mouth, her armour smoking from multiple holes. What? Only one weapon made scars like those. In the vestibule, the heavy bolter was still firing, its muzzle tracking the incoming beast. Leona had stepped back, given herself the full range and rate of fire; the monster was spraying thick, dark blood, shuddering under the onslaught, but it was still coming, climbing over the pews as if nothing could bring it down… But Sister Pia lay still. Facing the monster, Leona was still singing, her voice rising as the thing closed on her; she was back to the wall, now, had nowhere else to go. The deacon was still in his pulpit, still bellowing orders… But Sister Pia lay still. Stunned, Augusta watched as the heavy bolter started to cough. Leona swore, knowing she was down to her last few rounds, but she still kept firing as the monster skidded the last pews out of its way… But Sister Pia lay still. ‘By the Throne.’ Over the vox, Leona cursed aloud. ‘You’ll go down if I have to beat you to death myself!’ With a final rumble, the heavy bolter clacked loudly, and stopped. The silence was suddenly tremendous, echoing in Augusta’s ears. But – finally – the monster was down. Barely two feet from where Leona was standing, it had crashed to the floor, its chitin cracked, its arms splayed, its body coated in its own fluids. Its rear claws kicked once, and were still. The deacon cried, ‘Yes! Thank the Emperor!’ but they did not look up at him. Because Sister Pia lay still. Calmly, Veradis said, ‘Be sure, Leona.’ Her voice was full – victory, sacrifice, sadness. ‘Aye.’ Boots sounded as Leona walked over to the thing, her heavy bolter still in her hands. The single shot to its skull rang out like the last line of a hymn. ‘One round left in the chamber,’ she said, quietly. Like the presence of their small, hidden daggers, no one needed to ask her why it was there. But Sister Pia had not moved. ‘Her death was not your doing,’ Veradis said, one hand on Sister Leona’s shoulder. ‘It was a risk, and Sister Pia understood. We fight as the Emperor decrees.’ Leona’s lean, lined face was stone hard, her chin lifted, as if she kept any emotions to herself. At their feet, Sister Pia lay crumpled upon a bed of ­shattered glassaic, her black hair spread out, her expression frozen in the bared-teeth determination of pure combat. All down one side of her armour there were the telltale holes made by the heavy bolter. Her courage had enabled them to injure the beast, and had forced it to react to the weapon, rather than killing the rest of the squad. They – and the people – owed Pia their lives. Augusta knew that sacrifice was the greatest honour to which a Sister could aspire, but she had never before seen it in the field, and she stayed silent, looking down at Pia’s fallen form. She seemed so small. Veradis, however, was glaring at the deacon. ‘You declared this location secure.’ It was not a question. The deacon had not lost his pompousness. He was a small, round man, and he puffed himself up before answering: ‘How was I to know that your long-lost Sisters had not purged this moon completely? The failure is yours, Sororitas, not mine.’ Veradis eyed him as if she would break him in half, but said nothing. Instead, she said to the squad, ‘Retrieve your weapons. I want every doorway guarded. There will be no service here until we deploy fully through the tunnels and ensure that there are no further,’ she eyed the deacon, ‘surprises.’ ‘Aye.’ The Sisters did as they were ordered, but Augusta paused, Lucienne beside her. ‘Sister Superior, a question, if I may?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘This is the house of the Emperor. We do not bear weapons–’ ‘You’re asking why He did not defend us, Sister?’ Veradis’ tone held a certain wry amusement, perhaps at Augusta’s inexperience. ‘As the Scriptures would have us believe?’ Feeling the gazes of both deacon and Sister Superior, Augusta looked down at Pia’s fallen body and nodded. ‘Is that so foolish a question? How could such a creature be permitted…’ The deacon glowered at her. ‘He does not come when you call, Sister…’ Veradis held up a hand, and he quietened, tapping his foot. The Sister Superior said, ‘The xenos knows no respect. And what are we but His defence? What are we but His weapons? Twice now, you have faced foes without your bolter, and twice, you have triumphed. This is a test of our faith and mettle, like any other, wherever it may take place.’ Augusta stole a look at the now shining window, remembering the stone Sisters that stood at the doorway. ‘Our Sisters did not fail?’ ‘That is not for us to judge.’ Veradis shot the deacon a sideways glare. ‘We only do as we are bid, by His presence. You may grieve for Sister Pia, in the proper time, but you must first follow your orders.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Have no fear,’ Veradis said, her face softening to a rare smile. ‘Sister Pia stands before the Throne, and she does so in honour, her life given in battle.’ She glanced at the fallen creature, drawing Augusta’s attention and making the point. ‘We can only pray that, one day, we will be so blessed.’",

      "content": "The cathedral’s corpse was vast. Standing in its hollow heart, its darkness vaulted huge above her, Sister Superior Augusta rested one scarlet-gauntleted hand on the bolter at her hip. She said nothing, only scanned this icon of the Emperor’s might, searching for motion, for threat, for any remaining gleam of His light. But there was nothing. This was Ultima Segmentum’s darkest corner, and little reached out here. Beside her, the missionary Lysimachus Tanichus was speaking in hushed tones. ‘From the last years of the Age of Apostasy, Sister. Or so they say.’ His sibilance coiled in the dark, like echoes of millennia. Augusta gave a brief acknowledgement and walked carefully through the debris. The air was hot here, clammy with the overgrown jungle-marsh outside; twisted creepers had penetrated the cathedral’s crumbling walls and they writhed across the stonework like the tendrils of Chaos itself. Sweat itched at the fleur-de-lys tattoo on her cheek. ‘Sisters.’ She spoke softly into the vox at her throat. ‘Roll call.’ Five voices came back through the darkness. Augusta’s retinal lenses tracked their locations: blips deployed in a standard sweep-reconnaissance pattern. Her squad were experienced – all except one – and she had complete trust in their worthiness, and in their love for the Emperor. Together, they had carried fist and faith across every segmentum of the galaxy. Tanichus, fiddling with his rosarius, spoke again. ‘The Emperor’s light had not touched this world in millennia, Sister, not until I came here, carrying His name. The local townspeople told me of the cathedral. It’s a part of their mythology–’ ‘I trust you’ve brought them Truth,’ Augusta said. Her authority was unthreatened by the missionary, but she needed to listen – the brief from the canoness on Ophelia VII had listed this world as a potential staging point for Chaos, invading from the Eye of Terror, for witchkin or renegades, for marauding xenos of every kind. Augusta was a twenty-year veteran, her bobbed hair and stern gaze both steel-grey, and her experience made her both sharp and wary. ‘Me serve vivere, Sister,’ Tanichus said. ‘I live to serve.’ ‘Sister Jatoya,’ Augusta said into the vox. ‘Anything?’ Her second-in-command responded, ‘No, Sister. If there’s anything here, it’s well hidden.’ ‘Check everywhere.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Very well.’ Her touch still on the bolter, eyeing the decaying statues and pillars above her, Augusta gestured for Tanichus to keep speaking. But he told her only what she already knew: his history with the townspeople, and their rumours of the cathedral. The town held the place taboo, but they’d told Tanichus their local myth – that the ruin had a guardian, an armoured stone icon with a bloodied flower upon its chest. And Tanichus had carried word of this back to the Ecclesiarchy, and to the Sisters. A member of the Order of the Bloody Rose, Augusta had volunteered for the mission immediately – with the cathedral’s age, it was possible that the icon could be Saint Mina herself. ‘The Emperor has called me,’ she’d said to the canoness. ‘And I must go.’ Perhaps for more political reasons than visionary ones, the canoness had agreed. Her boots crunching over ancient, fallen masonry, Augusta climbed the steps towards the high altar. Ruin or not, she paused before the top and dropped to one armoured knee, her black cloak billowing and her hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on her armour. ‘Quantus tremor est futurus, quando attingit locum Lucis.’ How great the fear will be, when the Light touches this place! She felt the missionary shiver as he, too, knelt. Tanichus was a talker, a good man to carry the Emperor’s word, but she was His daughter, and her task was clear. She would find this icon. ‘Did the townspeople tell you anything further?’ she asked, coming back to her feet. ‘You lived with them for several months.’ ‘Only superstitions,’ he told her. ‘If this is your patron saint, Sister, then we must find her without their help.’ Augusta nodded. She gave her squad orders to structure their search, to move in a standard skirmish pattern throughout the cathedral’s cloisters and side-rooms. Sister Viola, the youngest, she ordered to stand guard at the fallen doors. Viola was new from the schola; she was high-hearted and eager to prove herself and that was all very well… but Augusta wanted her close. ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola, bolter in hand, returned to the doors and took her position, watching the huge and muggy writhe of the outside jungle. Over the vox, the Sister Superior recited the Litany of Mettle. Whatever was here, they would find it. In the cathedral’s transept stood a colossal thirty-foot statue, its broken hands raised in the sign of the aquila. It had been carved in full armour and, like all such things, it faced Holy Terra as if it still sought the Light. But if this was Saint Mina, then she had no face, and her insignia had long since fallen to dust. Augusta was scanning, carefully looking for age and identity, when the cry came from Viola at the doorway. ‘Sisters!’ The word was soft across the vox, but it carried the faintest of quivers. ‘I see movement!’ Augusta felt the touch of adrenaline and inhaled, enjoying the lift, the first flush of faith – as her briefing had warned her, this was a dangerous place. ‘Be specific,’ she said, turning to crunch back out to the nave, the cathedral’s main aisle. ‘What do you see?’ ‘Large force incoming. Seventy, eighty yards. Moving slowly, but heading this way.’ Her voice was taut with fear. ‘It’s hard to see them through the jungle.’ Tanichus followed at Augusta’s shoulder. The missionary had unhooked his lasrifle and looked slightly queasy; she hoped he could shoot straight. ‘Sisters, to me. Kimura, to the doorway. Jatoya, watch the rear.’ Kimura carried the squad’s heavy bolter, and its faster suppression would be critical. ‘Viola, description.’ ‘I can’t see well, Sister, but they’re all shoulders. They’re huge!’ ‘Space Marines?’ Jatoya’s tone was surprised. ‘Out here?’ But Kimura was at the doorway now, weapon at the ready. Her voice came back over the vox, her tones shuddering with a rising, burning eagerness. ‘They’re not Heretic Astartes, Sisters.’ The words were alight. ‘They’re orks.’ Orks. If there was one damned xenos that Augusta loathed, it was the ork. Filthy, stinking things, slavering and disorderly; they were as much the enemies of the Throne as any witch or heretic. She could feel her faith unfurling in her heart like a banner – she had a chance to reclaim this holy place, at the edge of the segmentum… But Augusta’s ruthless discipline was what had kept her alive through twenty years of warfare. She could embrace the love of her Emperor and keep her thoughts clear. She reached Kimura at the doorway, and used her auspex to look outside. Immediately, she saw why Viola had made the mistake. Many of the incoming beasts were enormous, bigger than the Sisters, armour and all. But this was not the disciplined advance of highly-trained soldiers, this was ramshackle, and noisy, and slow. The orks moved more like marauders; they laughed amongst themselves, pushing and shoving and snarling. Their tones were harsh and their voices guttural. They were hard to see through the steam, through the festooned and looping creepers. But they were heading straight for the cathedral. ‘Sister!’ Kimura had reached the same conclusion – her voice was tense. Augusta saw her take a sight on the lead ork, anger radiating from her stance as if her armour burned with it. ‘Hold your fire.’ For a moment, she thought Kimura would disobey, but Augusta’s command of her squad was too strong. Instead, Kimura paused, quivering, her finger on the trigger, tracking the orks as they approached. Behind them now, Viola’s breathing was swift in her vox. She was afraid – and Augusta understood. But still, the youngest of the squad had to control herself, and quickly. Swiftly, the Sister Superior gave orders for deployment. Kimura and Caia at the door, Viola and Melia at the front left archway, Jatoya, with her flamer, watching the rear. Augusta herself, Tanichus still with her, took position at the front arch to the right, its window long since put out by the creeper and shattered to forgotten dust. Outside, the orks advanced, oblivious. A fight had broken out amongst their number, cheered and jeered by those surrounding. Beneath her helmet, Augusta curled her lip – she had no fear of these beasts, whatever their numbers. Over the vox, she recited the Battle Hymnal and heard her Sisters join her, avidly soft. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ She felt Viola stiffen, felt her courage coalesce. She felt Kimura steady, ready to unleash His wrath on the incoming creatures and their blasphemous intentions… ‘Wait,’ she said, again. The orks moved closer. Within heavy bolter range. Within bolter range. Any moment now, they would see the crouching Sisters, their blood-scarlet armour and their black-and-white cloaks… ‘Sisters, stay down. Kimura, on my command, full covering suppression. For the Emperor… Fire!’ The orks had no idea what had hit them. Raiders and warriors alike, everything vanished in a hail of gore and shredding flesh. The heavy bolter howled in Kimura’s hands, and the jungle was ripped to pieces, leaves shining like shrapnel, trees and vines cut clean in half. One ancient trunk toppled over with a groan, but was stopped by a tangle of creeper. It hung there, creaking, like some huge executioner’s axe. Kimura’s voice came over the vox, louder now, ‘A morte perpetua, Domine, libra nos!’ The Hymn of Battle raged in tune with the furious barking of the weapon. The Sisters’ voices joined her, rising to crystal-pure harmonics as Kimura visited bloody destruction upon the orks. Augusta was grinning now, tight and violent beneath her helm. She knew this with every word in her ear, every flash in her blood – this was her worship, her purpose and her life. The Emperor Himself was with her, His fire in her heart, His touch in the creak and weight of her armour, in the bolter in her hand. She was here to unleash His wrath against the despoilers of this forgotten and holy place. And it felt good. At her other hip, her heavy chainsword clanked as if begging for release, but not yet… not yet. She heard Kimura’s singing ring with vehemence as the Sister cut the orks to pieces. ‘From the blasphemy of the Fallen, our Emperor, deliver us!’ But orks, despite many flaws, had no concept of intimidation. They had no interest in the Emperor’s wrath, no tactics, and no sense. Another force might have gone to ground, given covering fire, but not these beasts. Roaring with outrage, waving what clumsy weapons they had, they simply charged. Over the singing, Augusta shouted, ‘Kimura, fall back and reload! The rest of you, fire!’ She raised her own bolter, aiming for the largest ork she could see. Greenskins had a very simple rule of leadership – the bigger the beast, the more control it wielded. And if she could take out the leaders, the rest would be easier to kill. The battle hymn still sounded and she added her voice once again, feeling the music thrill along her nerves like wildfire. A second wave of orks raged forwards, leering and eager. There seemed to be no end to them. The beasts were closing fast now, and she could see them clearly: their jutting teeth and green skin, their rusted weapons, their armour all scrappy pieces of ceramite and steel, scrounged from who knew what battlefields. One had a set of white pauldrons bearing the distinctive fleur-de-lys. Snarling, she blew it away. But their losses didn’t touch them; they picked up the weapons of their dying and their trampled, and they just kept coming. Bolters barked and howled in red-gauntleted hands. Tanichus took single shots with his lasrifle, picking his targets carefully. The jungle became a mess of blood and smoke and noise, but still the orks came on, slobbering and shouting, ripping through creepers and fallen trees. To one side, there was a lashing and a gurgle and half a dozen greenskins vanished, shrieking and struggling, below the surface of the marsh. Jeers and calls came from the rest, but they didn’t slow down. ‘There’s too many of them!’ The youngest Sister’s cry broke the hymn’s purity and Augusta felt her squad waver. She raised her voice to a paean, a clarion call like a holy trumpet, allowing them no pause. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Shrieking with fury, Viola resumed firing. But the orks didn’t care. They tore themselves free from the jungle’s tangle and threw themselves at the steps. The lead ork went backwards in a spray of crimson mist. The others were already boiling past it. Tanichus kept firing, streaks of light past Augusta’s shoulder. Augusta switched to full suppression and heard the bolters of the others, all growling in righteous fury. Yet the orks still came. They were like a rotting green tide, large creatures and small, no structure, no fear. They bayed and snarled like animals. The Sisters couldn’t stop them all. Fury rose in Augusta and was annealed to a magnesium-white flare of righteous wrath. You shall not enter here! Viola, afraid, screamed the words of the hymnal, the same verse, over and over… The advance stopped. Shredded leaves fluttered slowly to the rotting jungle floor. The orks had paused. Changing magazine with an action so reflexive she barely noticed, Augusta scanned them through her retinal lenses, wondering what in Dominica’s name they were doing. Had they just been overcome by the holiness of the cathedral itself? Somehow, she doubted it. She watched as the creatures at the front moved, taking cover behind toppled statues. She gave the order to keep firing and heard the bolters start again. The beasts knew the Sisters were here – and they’d responded. Smart orks? The idea was horrifying. Yet something down there – the warboss or whatever it was – had intelligence. It made her wonder if their presence was pure coincidence… and an odd chill went down her back. The lead orks had taken cover now, and the jungle was ominously quiet. Behind them, through the rising steam, she could see bigger figures, moving forwards. Several had stubby sidearms, luridly decorated; the weapons gave a steady bark of fire. Rounds chewed chunks out of the stone and made the Sisters keep their heads down. And one of them– ‘Get back from the windows! Take cover!’ Her squad were already on the move, throwing themselves back. They didn’t wait for the ork with the rocket launcher to loose his leering-skull-painted missile… straight into the cathedral nave. Augusta hit the floor, taking Tanichus down with her. The world erupted in fire. She heard the whistling of shrapnel, felt the whoosh of heat that seared her armour and shrivelled her cloak to tatters. The orks would use the cover of the missile to gain entrance to the building, and she was back on her feet, even as the flame was dying. ‘Sisters! Roll call!’ Tanichus was scrambling up, charred but unhurt – Augusta had covered as much of his unarmoured body as was possible. He was coughing, fumbling for his lasrifle amongst the settling dust. Five voices came back to her, making her thank the Emperor Himself for the courage and experience of her squad. The orks were on them now, piling through the doors, scrambling over the window ledges – if all else failed, Augusta would bring the building down in a final hail of rounds, and kill everything within. For the glory of the Emperor! But they were not done yet. They would fight with the Emperor Himself at their backs, and they would fight to their last breath. ‘Kimura–!’ She started to give orders to fall back, for Kimura’s heavy bolter to cover them, but her voice was lost under the detonation of a grenade, impacting right at Kimura’s feet. The Sister disappeared in a blast of smoke and fragments. Viola screamed. Chunks of roof tumbled to the floor. Tanichus scrabbled away on his backside, his rifle lost. Now, the orks were all over the nave. Augusta could see the smaller, darker gretchins, scuttling in among their boots, picking things up and shaking them and biting them, then scurrying gleefully away. Slinging the bolter, she drew the chainsword and started the mechanism. It snarled into life like pure impatience, eager for the blasphemers’ blood. Called by the rasp of the weapon, the Sisters were upon the orks with fists and feet and fury, punching one, kicking it to the floor, then ripping the axe out of its grip and using it on the one behind. Their armour, already red, slicked brighter with colours of death. But somewhere under the combat-high, Augusta was beginning to understand something: this was not just a random raid, it was too big, too clever, too strong. These orks had come here knowingly. And they’d come expecting resistance. A hand grabbed her cloak and pulled her backwards. She spun the chainsword, slashed through the neck of one ork and into the chest of another. Both went over, one still howling, and her thoughts were forgotten – she had other priorities. Stamping at the impertinent gretchins, she slashed at a third ork, and a fourth. She was wrath incarnate, the rage of the Emperor, carving flesh and bone and armour, and spraying gore like red wine. Tanichus had vanished, somewhere in the mess. Sister Jatoya shouted over the vox – the orks had got round behind them. Clever indeed. The flamer roared as Jatoya retreated, searing the enemy and sending them screaming, burning, stumbling. The wet and seething creepers started to smoke. And then, Augusta saw something else. Warboss. Throne, the beast was big! Seven and a half feet of pure, green muscle. It had metal in its ears, one lower tooth that jutted over its face, and an almost full set of armour that offered more than one well-known symbol – Blood Angels, Imperial Fists, the eight-pointed emblem of Chaos. It was a champion, and the biggest damned ork she’d ever seen. And if that thing was out here scavenging, then she was straight out of the schola. It had a sharp, sly glimmer in its red eyes – and its gaze stopped on Augusta. She snarled at it, ‘Mori blasphemus fui.’ Die, blasphemer. Around them, the melee slowed to a fluid dance of blood and blades. From the corner of her eye, Augusta saw Viola punch her scarlet gauntlet clean into an ork’s face, saw the ork rock backwards, then shake itself and grin. But her attention was still on the leader. Just as its was on her. They were the eye of the storm. The ork carried twin axes, each as long as its muscled forearm, and there was a second grenade at its belt. It said, ‘Sis-tah.’ But the snarl of the chainsword was its only reply. Not only big, but fast. Augusta was used to orks being slow, bearing down an enemy by brute force, rather than by speed or skill. Not this thing. In her mind, she recited the Litany of Blood – a reflex, a chant of pure focus. It was part of her combat training, something she’d learned at the schola, and it made her sharp, the tool of the might that flowed through her. But her first side-slash was blocked, then the second, the rasp of the chainsword rising to a scream as the axes caught in its teeth. The ork didn’t falter. It was controlled and powerful. She went backwards, parrying one blow after another, her boots scattering dust and mess and fallen ork bodies. And it came after her, its breath as foul as its coated yellow teeth. It was still talking; threats and mockery, but she had no interest in bandying words with it. It was defiler and despoiler, and it would die. Another blow, and another. She tried to press forwards, but it gave her no gap in which to strike. Around her, the rest of the squad fought with knives and fists, hammering the orks to a bloody green pulp. She saw one Sister falter, and fall to her knees. ‘Sis-tah.’ Grinning, the monster dropped both axes. It grabbed the chainsword, blades and all, in one massive hand, and tore it out of her grasp. It threw it aside. She saw Jatoya’s flamer in the corner of her vision, saw Caia and Melia together pick an ork up bodily and hurl it into a gathering of its fellows, sending all of them scattering to the floor. They would win this! It almost made her laugh, the sound like pure, righteous joy. With only her gauntlets, she threw herself at the monster. But it was too fast – it grabbed her, its chainsword-carved hand around her gorget, and it lifted her clean off the floor. Furious now, she kicked it. Again. Again. She split the beast’s lip, but its grin only widened, its teeth now streaked with its own blood. Furious, she took its wrist in her gasp and tried to twist and crush its arm, force it to drop her. It shook her like an errant underling. ‘Sister!’ Across the vox, she heard Jatoya’s cry. Her second in command couldn’t use her flamer but Jatoya barked a clear order at the rest of the squad. ‘Take it down!’ The warboss didn’t care. It shook her again, her armour clattering. ‘Sis-tah,’ it said. ‘Know you. Came to find.’ What? ‘Wait!’ The word was a gurgle over the vox. The beast was laughing at her. ‘We take all. Kill sis-tahs. Take weapons.’ Understanding grew up her spine like ice. She stared at the ork as it shook her for the third time. Take weapons. It had known that the Sisters were here! The fighting around them was beginning to lessen. The orks were faltering, and the Sisters hacked at them without mercy, driving them back. Many of the smaller beasts were dropping their weapons and running away. Jatoya had slung her flamer and fought with her fists alone; Augusta saw her punch an ork in the back of the neck, saw it stumble to its knees. One red-armoured figure – she couldn’t tell who – was walking through the mess, bolter in hand, putting single shots into struggling heaps. Another was clearing the bodies from the altar steps, and she could see the broken form of Kimura, smoke still rising from the joints in her armour. Then she saw one Sister click the neck of her helm and remove it, revealing a freckled face and bobbed red hair, all tousled and sweating. Viola. Her expression was like acid-carved steel. ‘Put her down.’ Viola raised her bolter, and took clear aim at the ork’s head. The warboss paused. Augusta saw it look round at its defeated force; saw its red eyes narrow, its lip curl. Then it let her go, and she fell, crashing to her knees on the cathedral floor. Viola came closer, the bolter aimed and steady. The ork bared its teeth at her. Impressed with the new mettle of the youngest Sister, Augusta stood up. She stepped in close to the warboss and said, ‘You knew we were here.’ Talking to the thing made her flesh crawl, but she had to know. ‘How? Who told you?’ ‘Sis-tah.’ The warboss looked from Augusta to Viola and back. It cocked its head to one side and said, ‘So fool-ish. So tiny.’ Augusta glared at it. ‘How did you know?’ ‘Blood Axes.’ It thumped the crossed-axe symbol on its chest. ‘We kill. Take weapons.’ She held its red gaze. Augusta had heard of the Blood Axes, they traded with humans sometimes – it might explain why this monster was so damned clever. But not how it had known– Tanichus. The realisation came like the Light of the Emperor Himself – a ray of pure Truth. Tanichus had been here before – had lived here for months – and only Tanichus had known that the Sisters were coming. And, as Augusta remembered, he’d used his local knowledge to set the time of their reconnaissance. He’d told them when to be here. ‘Get the missionary.’ She snapped the command over the vox, saw Caia nod and turn away. ‘What did he offer you?’ she said to the warboss. It sneered at her, its red eyes cold. Reached for the grenade at its belt. She saw the motion, went to kick its wrist – but Viola was faster. Her face like stone, the youngest Sister shot it clean through the head. Gore spattered. The huge beast teetered for a second, almost as if startled – then it crashed to the floor like a tree falling. The whole building seemed to shake. A pool of crimson spread out across the flagstones. ‘Good shot,’ Augusta told the youngest Sister. Viola grinned. Behind them, Caia had returned with Tanichus, the missionary almost gibbering with fear. ‘Found him trying to flee,’ Caia said. ‘Scuttling out of the crypt like an insect.’ ‘Sister!’ The missionary was white-faced; he looked like he was about to vomit. Her armour still dripping, she walked over to him, closing her hand about his neck just like the ork’s had been about her own. He looked at her, his eyes wide, his mouth open. ‘Sister Superior, I swear by His light–’ ‘You dare? You dare swear by the Emperor’s name?’ Her hand closed; she felt his breath catch in his throat. ‘I should crush you where you stand.’ ‘Sister, please!’ At her feet, the warboss lay dead. The orks were finished and the Sisters had closed ranks at Augusta’s shoulders – the entire cathedral seemed gathered at her back, looking at the missionary. ‘You’ve been here before,’ Augusta said. ‘Lived with the townspeople. You’re the link, Tanichus. You’re the only thing that could have manipulated the pieces. Tell me, did you speak to the orks? Deal with them? Did you lie about the icon? Something to bring us out here, just so the orks could kill us for our weapons.’ She shook him like a rat. ‘Sister, I swear!’ Disgusted, she let him go, watched as Caia’s gauntleted hands closed on his shoulders and forced him to his knees. ‘Sister Kimura died,’ Augusta said. She freed the seal on her helm and took it off, enjoying the relative cool of the marsh-thick air. Meeting her flat, steel gaze, Tanichus was starting to panic. ‘Please!’ She dropped to one knee, gripped his jaw in one bloody gauntlet and forced him to look at her. ‘Repent, heretic, you may yet save your soul.’ Tanichus was shaking now, his face pale. Sweat shone from his skin. She’d seen this a hundred times in the suddenly caught-out-and-penitent – the guilt, the fear. And they were exactly the admission she was looking for. ‘Tell me the truth,’ she snarled at him. ‘What deal did you do?’ He was snivelling now, terrified. Words spilled out of him. ‘When I came here,’ he said, ‘the townspeople told me about the orks. The tribe had been destroying the villages, committing such horrors… and they were going to wipe out the town. The people told the orks about the cathedral. Said they could have anything they could find if they just left the town alone. Then I came, and they begged me for my help. They knew that the orks would come back. Knew what would happen to them.’ He seemed almost in tears. ‘They’re just people, Sister, just families. They have lives and fears and hopes. Children growing up.’ His face was etched in pain. ‘I just wanted to help them.’ He held back a sob. Augusta saw the pity on Viola’s freckled face, saw the stances of the others shift – they knew full well what the orks would have done to the towns-people. He said, ‘I went to find the orks. I told them that I would bring them weapons, armour, if they just left the people alone. And–’ ‘And so you brought them us.’ Augusta’s tone was scathing. ‘You beat them, didn’t you?’ He was pleading with her. ‘You won!’ She contemplated the sobbing man, water tracing clean lines through the filth on his skin, and she understood his pain, the choice he’d made. But it didn’t change the facts. ‘Lysimachus Tanichus, you are a traitor. You have manipulated the Adepta Sororitas to your own ends. You have betrayed the Ecclesiarchy, and the name of the Emperor.’ Tanichus opened his mouth, but she didn’t want to hear it. ‘And your story misses one critical point – what would have happened if we’d lost?’ ‘You’re Sister Superior Augusta Santorus – you don’t lose!’ ‘Tell that to Kimura.’ Tanichus glanced at the fallen Sister, then slumped forwards, defeated. He was sniffling. ‘I only wanted to help the people.’ ‘You betrayed us to the enemy.’ She backhanded him, her metal gauntlet cutting his cheek. His head snapped sideways, then he looked back up at her, uncomprehending and horrified. ‘You brought us here on a lie. You cost the life of Sister Kimura. You tried to flee the battle. Your guilt is manifest, and your life is forfeit.’ He stared at her, his mouth open. But she wasn’t done. ‘However, I will say this – this world, Lautis, in the Drusus Marches of the Calixis Sector, is now under the observation and protection of the Order of the Bloody Rose. We claim this cathedral, and all within it, in His name. And we will protect the people – on the assumption that they acknowledge the Emperor of All Mankind.’ Tanichus had fallen forwards. He was shaking, his hands over his face. ‘Please! I knew you’d beat them! I knew!’ ‘I will deliver your protection, Tanichus. But you…’ She dragged his head up again. ‘In pythonissam non patieris vivere – I shall not suffer your life.’ ‘Sister Superior…’ Viola’s voice came to her ears, not over the vox. ‘He should come back with us, face judgement–’ ‘Enough!’ Augusta snapped the order and Viola recoiled. ‘I know exactly what to do with this offal.’ ‘Sister,’ Jatoya said, more cautiously. ‘It is not our place–’ ‘He has mocked us!’ Augusta barked, furious. ‘Kimura is dead!’ Tanichus threw himself at her feet. ‘Please!’ Viola and Jatoya exchanged a glance. Augusta reached down with one hand, and dragged the sobbing man back to his feet. ‘You do not take the name of the saint in vain. You do not manipulate the Order to your own ends. And believe me, if the orks had won, both you and your town would still have been destroyed. That warboss would have cut you to pieces and eaten you.’ Tanichus was shaking now. She tore the rosarius out of his grasp, gave it to the closest of her Sisters. Then she pulled her fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour, and slit Tanichus’ throat. Augusta felt Viola flinch, though she said nothing. Tanichus gaped and fell, bubbles on his lips, hands to his throat, his blood mingling with that of the dead ork. His last word, as he hit the floor, was Mercy.",

      "content": "The cathedral’s corpse was vast. Standing in its hollow heart, its darkness vaulted huge above her, Sister Superior Augusta rested one scarlet-gauntleted hand on the bolter at her hip. She said nothing, only scanned this icon of the Emperor’s might, searching for motion, for threat, for any remaining gleam of His light. But there was nothing. This was Ultima Segmentum’s darkest corner, and little reached out here. Beside her, the missionary Lysimachus Tanichus was speaking in hushed tones. ‘From the last years of the Age of Apostasy, Sister. Or so they say.’ His sibilance coiled in the dark, like echoes of millennia. Augusta gave a brief acknowledgement and walked carefully through the debris. The air was hot here, clammy with the overgrown jungle-marsh outside; twisted creepers had penetrated the cathedral’s crumbling walls and they writhed across the stonework like the tendrils of Chaos itself. Sweat itched at the fleur-de-lys tattoo on her cheek. ‘Sisters.’ She spoke softly into the vox at her throat. ‘Roll call.’ Five voices came back through the darkness. Augusta’s retinal lenses tracked their locations: blips deployed in a standard sweep-reconnaissance pattern. Her squad were experienced – all except one – and she had complete trust in their worthiness, and in their love for the Emperor. Together, they had carried fist and faith across every segmentum of the galaxy. Tanichus, fiddling with his rosarius, spoke again. ‘The Emperor’s light had not touched this world in millennia, Sister, not until I came here, carrying His name. The local townspeople told me of the cathedral. It’s a part of their mythology–’ ‘I trust you’ve brought them Truth,’ Augusta said. Her authority was unthreatened by the missionary, but she needed to listen – the brief from the canoness on Ophelia VII had listed this world as a potential staging point for Chaos, invading from the Eye of Terror, for witchkin or renegades, for marauding xenos of every kind. Augusta was a twenty-year veteran, her bobbed hair and stern gaze both steel-grey, and her experience made her both sharp and wary. ‘Me serve vivere, Sister,’ Tanichus said. ‘I live to serve.’ ‘Sister Jatoya,’ Augusta said into the vox. ‘Anything?’ Her second-in-command responded, ‘No, Sister. If there’s anything here, it’s well hidden.’ ‘Check everywhere.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Very well.’ Her touch still on the bolter, eyeing the decaying statues and pillars above her, Augusta gestured for Tanichus to keep speaking. But he told her only what she already knew: his history with the townspeople, and their rumours of the cathedral. The town held the place taboo, but they’d told Tanichus their local myth – that the ruin had a guardian, an armoured stone icon with a bloodied flower upon its chest. And Tanichus had carried word of this back to the Ecclesiarchy, and to the Sisters. A member of the Order of the Bloody Rose, Augusta had volunteered for the mission immediately – with the cathedral’s age, it was possible that the icon could be Saint Mina herself. ‘The Emperor has called me,’ she’d said to the canoness. ‘And I must go.’ Perhaps for more political reasons than visionary ones, the canoness had agreed. Her boots crunching over ancient, fallen masonry, Augusta climbed the steps towards the high altar. Ruin or not, she paused before the top and dropped to one armoured knee, her black cloak billowing and her hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on her armour. ‘Quantus tremor est futurus, quando attingit locum Lucis.’ How great the fear will be, when the Light touches this place! She felt the missionary shiver as he, too, knelt. Tanichus was a talker, a good man to carry the Emperor’s word, but she was His daughter, and her task was clear. She would find this icon. ‘Did the townspeople tell you anything further?’ she asked, coming back to her feet. ‘You lived with them for several months.’ ‘Only superstitions,’ he told her. ‘If this is your patron saint, Sister, then we must find her without their help.’ Augusta nodded. She gave her squad orders to structure their search, to move in a standard skirmish pattern throughout the cathedral’s cloisters and side-rooms. Sister Viola, the youngest, she ordered to stand guard at the fallen doors. Viola was new from the schola; she was high-hearted and eager to prove herself and that was all very well… but Augusta wanted her close. ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola, bolter in hand, returned to the doors and took her position, watching the huge and muggy writhe of the outside jungle. Over the vox, the Sister Superior recited the Litany of Mettle. Whatever was here, they would find it. In the cathedral’s transept stood a colossal thirty-foot statue, its broken hands raised in the sign of the aquila. It had been carved in full armour and, like all such things, it faced Holy Terra as if it still sought the Light. But if this was Saint Mina, then she had no face, and her insignia had long since fallen to dust. Augusta was scanning, carefully looking for age and identity, when the cry came from Viola at the doorway. ‘Sisters!’ The word was soft across the vox, but it carried the faintest of quivers. ‘I see movement!’ Augusta felt the touch of adrenaline and inhaled, enjoying the lift, the first flush of faith – as her briefing had warned her, this was a dangerous place. ‘Be specific,’ she said, turning to crunch back out to the nave, the cathedral’s main aisle. ‘What do you see?’ ‘Large force incoming. Seventy, eighty yards. Moving slowly, but heading this way.’ Her voice was taut with fear. ‘It’s hard to see them through the jungle.’ Tanichus followed at Augusta’s shoulder. The missionary had unhooked his lasrifle and looked slightly queasy; she hoped he could shoot straight. ‘Sisters, to me. Kimura, to the doorway. Jatoya, watch the rear.’ Kimura carried the squad’s heavy bolter, and its faster suppression would be critical. ‘Viola, description.’ ‘I can’t see well, Sister, but they’re all shoulders. They’re huge!’ ‘Space Marines?’ Jatoya’s tone was surprised. ‘Out here?’ But Kimura was at the doorway now, weapon at the ready. Her voice came back over the vox, her tones shuddering with a rising, burning eagerness. ‘They’re not Heretic Astartes, Sisters.’ The words were alight. ‘They’re orks.’ Orks. If there was one damned xenos that Augusta loathed, it was the ork. Filthy, stinking things, slavering and disorderly; they were as much the enemies of the Throne as any witch or heretic. She could feel her faith unfurling in her heart like a banner – she had a chance to reclaim this holy place, at the edge of the segmentum… But Augusta’s ruthless discipline was what had kept her alive through twenty years of warfare. She could embrace the love of her Emperor and keep her thoughts clear. She reached Kimura at the doorway, and used her auspex to look outside. Immediately, she saw why Viola had made the mistake. Many of the incoming beasts were enormous, bigger than the Sisters, armour and all. But this was not the disciplined advance of highly-trained soldiers, this was ramshackle, and noisy, and slow. The orks moved more like marauders; they laughed amongst themselves, pushing and shoving and snarling. Their tones were harsh and their voices guttural. They were hard to see through the steam, through the festooned and looping creepers. But they were heading straight for the cathedral. ‘Sister!’ Kimura had reached the same conclusion – her voice was tense. Augusta saw her take a sight on the lead ork, anger radiating from her stance as if her armour burned with it. ‘Hold your fire.’ For a moment, she thought Kimura would disobey, but Augusta’s command of her squad was too strong. Instead, Kimura paused, quivering, her finger on the trigger, tracking the orks as they approached. Behind them now, Viola’s breathing was swift in her vox. She was afraid – and Augusta understood. But still, the youngest of the squad had to control herself, and quickly. Swiftly, the Sister Superior gave orders for deployment. Kimura and Caia at the door, Viola and Melia at the front left archway, Jatoya, with her flamer, watching the rear. Augusta herself, Tanichus still with her, took position at the front arch to the right, its window long since put out by the creeper and shattered to forgotten dust. Outside, the orks advanced, oblivious. A fight had broken out amongst their number, cheered and jeered by those surrounding. Beneath her helmet, Augusta curled her lip – she had no fear of these beasts, whatever their numbers. Over the vox, she recited the Battle Hymnal and heard her Sisters join her, avidly soft. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ She felt Viola stiffen, felt her courage coalesce. She felt Kimura steady, ready to unleash His wrath on the incoming creatures and their blasphemous intentions… ‘Wait,’ she said, again. The orks moved closer. Within heavy bolter range. Within bolter range. Any moment now, they would see the crouching Sisters, their blood-scarlet armour and their black-and-white cloaks… ‘Sisters, stay down. Kimura, on my command, full covering suppression. For the Emperor… Fire!’ The orks had no idea what had hit them. Raiders and warriors alike, everything vanished in a hail of gore and shredding flesh. The heavy bolter howled in Kimura’s hands, and the jungle was ripped to pieces, leaves shining like shrapnel, trees and vines cut clean in half. One ancient trunk toppled over with a groan, but was stopped by a tangle of creeper. It hung there, creaking, like some huge executioner’s axe. Kimura’s voice came over the vox, louder now, ‘A morte perpetua, Domine, libra nos!’ The Hymn of Battle raged in tune with the furious barking of the weapon. The Sisters’ voices joined her, rising to crystal-pure harmonics as Kimura visited bloody destruction upon the orks. Augusta was grinning now, tight and violent beneath her helm. She knew this with every word in her ear, every flash in her blood – this was her worship, her purpose and her life. The Emperor Himself was with her, His fire in her heart, His touch in the creak and weight of her armour, in the bolter in her hand. She was here to unleash His wrath against the despoilers of this forgotten and holy place. And it felt good. At her other hip, her heavy chainsword clanked as if begging for release, but not yet… not yet. She heard Kimura’s singing ring with vehemence as the Sister cut the orks to pieces. ‘From the blasphemy of the Fallen, our Emperor, deliver us!’ But orks, despite many flaws, had no concept of intimidation. They had no interest in the Emperor’s wrath, no tactics, and no sense. Another force might have gone to ground, given covering fire, but not these beasts. Roaring with outrage, waving what clumsy weapons they had, they simply charged. Over the singing, Augusta shouted, ‘Kimura, fall back and reload! The rest of you, fire!’ She raised her own bolter, aiming for the largest ork she could see. Greenskins had a very simple rule of leadership – the bigger the beast, the more control it wielded. And if she could take out the leaders, the rest would be easier to kill. The battle hymn still sounded and she added her voice once again, feeling the music thrill along her nerves like wildfire. A second wave of orks raged forwards, leering and eager. There seemed to be no end to them. The beasts were closing fast now, and she could see them clearly: their jutting teeth and green skin, their rusted weapons, their armour all scrappy pieces of ceramite and steel, scrounged from who knew what battlefields. One had a set of white pauldrons bearing the distinctive fleur-de-lys. Snarling, she blew it away. But their losses didn’t touch them; they picked up the weapons of their dying and their trampled, and they just kept coming. Bolters barked and howled in red-gauntleted hands. Tanichus took single shots with his lasrifle, picking his targets carefully. The jungle became a mess of blood and smoke and noise, but still the orks came on, slobbering and shouting, ripping through creepers and fallen trees. To one side, there was a lashing and a gurgle and half a dozen greenskins vanished, shrieking and struggling, below the surface of the marsh. Jeers and calls came from the rest, but they didn’t slow down. ‘There’s too many of them!’ The youngest Sister’s cry broke the hymn’s purity and Augusta felt her squad waver. She raised her voice to a paean, a clarion call like a holy trumpet, allowing them no pause. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Shrieking with fury, Viola resumed firing. But the orks didn’t care. They tore themselves free from the jungle’s tangle and threw themselves at the steps. The lead ork went backwards in a spray of crimson mist. The others were already boiling past it. Tanichus kept firing, streaks of light past Augusta’s shoulder. Augusta switched to full suppression and heard the bolters of the others, all growling in righteous fury. Yet the orks still came. They were like a rotting green tide, large creatures and small, no structure, no fear. They bayed and snarled like animals. The Sisters couldn’t stop them all. Fury rose in Augusta and was annealed to a magnesium-white flare of righteous wrath. You shall not enter here! Viola, afraid, screamed the words of the hymnal, the same verse, over and over… The advance stopped. Shredded leaves fluttered slowly to the rotting jungle floor. The orks had paused. Changing magazine with an action so reflexive she barely noticed, Augusta scanned them through her retinal lenses, wondering what in Dominica’s name they were doing. Had they just been overcome by the holiness of the cathedral itself? Somehow, she doubted it. She watched as the creatures at the front moved, taking cover behind toppled statues. She gave the order to keep firing and heard the bolters start again. The beasts knew the Sisters were here – and they’d responded. Smart orks? The idea was horrifying. Yet something down there – the warboss or whatever it was – had intelligence. It made her wonder if their presence was pure coincidence… and an odd chill went down her back. The lead orks had taken cover now, and the jungle was ominously quiet. Behind them, through the rising steam, she could see bigger figures, moving forwards. Several had stubby sidearms, luridly decorated; the weapons gave a steady bark of fire. Rounds chewed chunks out of the stone and made the Sisters keep their heads down. And one of them– ‘Get back from the windows! Take cover!’ Her squad were already on the move, throwing themselves back. They didn’t wait for the ork with the rocket launcher to loose his leering-skull-painted missile… straight into the cathedral nave. Augusta hit the floor, taking Tanichus down with her. The world erupted in fire. She heard the whistling of shrapnel, felt the whoosh of heat that seared her armour and shrivelled her cloak to tatters. The orks would use the cover of the missile to gain entrance to the building, and she was back on her feet, even as the flame was dying. ‘Sisters! Roll call!’ Tanichus was scrambling up, charred but unhurt – Augusta had covered as much of his unarmoured body as was possible. He was coughing, fumbling for his lasrifle amongst the settling dust. Five voices came back to her, making her thank the Emperor Himself for the courage and experience of her squad. The orks were on them now, piling through the doors, scrambling over the window ledges – if all else failed, Augusta would bring the building down in a final hail of rounds, and kill everything within. For the glory of the Emperor! But they were not done yet. They would fight with the Emperor Himself at their backs, and they would fight to their last breath. ‘Kimura–!’ She started to give orders to fall back, for Kimura’s heavy bolter to cover them, but her voice was lost under the detonation of a grenade, impacting right at Kimura’s feet. The Sister disappeared in a blast of smoke and fragments. Viola screamed. Chunks of roof tumbled to the floor. Tanichus scrabbled away on his backside, his rifle lost. Now, the orks were all over the nave. Augusta could see the smaller, darker gretchins, scuttling in among their boots, picking things up and shaking them and biting them, then scurrying gleefully away. Slinging the bolter, she drew the chainsword and started the mechanism. It snarled into life like pure impatience, eager for the blasphemers’ blood. Called by the rasp of the weapon, the Sisters were upon the orks with fists and feet and fury, punching one, kicking it to the floor, then ripping the axe out of its grip and using it on the one behind. Their armour, already red, slicked brighter with colours of death. But somewhere under the combat-high, Augusta was beginning to understand something: this was not just a random raid, it was too big, too clever, too strong. These orks had come here knowingly. And they’d come expecting resistance. A hand grabbed her cloak and pulled her backwards. She spun the chainsword, slashed through the neck of one ork and into the chest of another. Both went over, one still howling, and her thoughts were forgotten – she had other priorities. Stamping at the impertinent gretchins, she slashed at a third ork, and a fourth. She was wrath incarnate, the rage of the Emperor, carving flesh and bone and armour, and spraying gore like red wine. Tanichus had vanished, somewhere in the mess. Sister Jatoya shouted over the vox – the orks had got round behind them. Clever indeed. The flamer roared as Jatoya retreated, searing the enemy and sending them screaming, burning, stumbling. The wet and seething creepers started to smoke. And then, Augusta saw something else. Warboss. Throne, the beast was big! Seven and a half feet of pure, green muscle. It had metal in its ears, one lower tooth that jutted over its face, and an almost full set of armour that offered more than one well-known symbol – Blood Angels, Imperial Fists, the eight-pointed emblem of Chaos. It was a champion, and the biggest damned ork she’d ever seen. And if that thing was out here scavenging, then she was straight out of the schola. It had a sharp, sly glimmer in its red eyes – and its gaze stopped on Augusta. She snarled at it, ‘Mori blasphemus fui.’ Die, blasphemer. Around them, the melee slowed to a fluid dance of blood and blades. From the corner of her eye, Augusta saw Viola punch her scarlet gauntlet clean into an ork’s face, saw the ork rock backwards, then shake itself and grin. But her attention was still on the leader. Just as its was on her. They were the eye of the storm. The ork carried twin axes, each as long as its muscled forearm, and there was a second grenade at its belt. It said, ‘Sis-tah.’ But the snarl of the chainsword was its only reply. Not only big, but fast. Augusta was used to orks being slow, bearing down an enemy by brute force, rather than by speed or skill. Not this thing. In her mind, she recited the Litany of Blood – a reflex, a chant of pure focus. It was part of her combat training, something she’d learned at the schola, and it made her sharp, the tool of the might that flowed through her. But her first side-slash was blocked, then the second, the rasp of the chainsword rising to a scream as the axes caught in its teeth. The ork didn’t falter. It was controlled and powerful. She went backwards, parrying one blow after another, her boots scattering dust and mess and fallen ork bodies. And it came after her, its breath as foul as its coated yellow teeth. It was still talking; threats and mockery, but she had no interest in bandying words with it. It was defiler and despoiler, and it would die. Another blow, and another. She tried to press forwards, but it gave her no gap in which to strike. Around her, the rest of the squad fought with knives and fists, hammering the orks to a bloody green pulp. She saw one Sister falter, and fall to her knees. ‘Sis-tah.’ Grinning, the monster dropped both axes. It grabbed the chainsword, blades and all, in one massive hand, and tore it out of her grasp. It threw it aside. She saw Jatoya’s flamer in the corner of her vision, saw Caia and Melia together pick an ork up bodily and hurl it into a gathering of its fellows, sending all of them scattering to the floor. They would win this! It almost made her laugh, the sound like pure, righteous joy. With only her gauntlets, she threw herself at the monster. But it was too fast – it grabbed her, its chainsword-carved hand around her gorget, and it lifted her clean off the floor. Furious now, she kicked it. Again. Again. She split the beast’s lip, but its grin only widened, its teeth now streaked with its own blood. Furious, she took its wrist in her gasp and tried to twist and crush its arm, force it to drop her. It shook her like an errant underling. ‘Sister!’ Across the vox, she heard Jatoya’s cry. Her second in command couldn’t use her flamer but Jatoya barked a clear order at the rest of the squad. ‘Take it down!’ The warboss didn’t care. It shook her again, her armour clattering. ‘Sis-tah,’ it said. ‘Know you. Came to find.’ What? ‘Wait!’ The word was a gurgle over the vox. The beast was laughing at her. ‘We take all. Kill sis-tahs. Take weapons.’ Understanding grew up her spine like ice. She stared at the ork as it shook her for the third time. Take weapons. It had known that the Sisters were here! The fighting around them was beginning to lessen. The orks were faltering, and the Sisters hacked at them without mercy, driving them back. Many of the smaller beasts were dropping their weapons and running away. Jatoya had slung her flamer and fought with her fists alone; Augusta saw her punch an ork in the back of the neck, saw it stumble to its knees. One red-armoured figure – she couldn’t tell who – was walking through the mess, bolter in hand, putting single shots into struggling heaps. Another was clearing the bodies from the altar steps, and she could see the broken form of Kimura, smoke still rising from the joints in her armour. Then she saw one Sister click the neck of her helm and remove it, revealing a freckled face and bobbed red hair, all tousled and sweating. Viola. Her expression was like acid-carved steel. ‘Put her down.’ Viola raised her bolter, and took clear aim at the ork’s head. The warboss paused. Augusta saw it look round at its defeated force; saw its red eyes narrow, its lip curl. Then it let her go, and she fell, crashing to her knees on the cathedral floor. Viola came closer, the bolter aimed and steady. The ork bared its teeth at her. Impressed with the new mettle of the youngest Sister, Augusta stood up. She stepped in close to the warboss and said, ‘You knew we were here.’ Talking to the thing made her flesh crawl, but she had to know. ‘How? Who told you?’ ‘Sis-tah.’ The warboss looked from Augusta to Viola and back. It cocked its head to one side and said, ‘So fool-ish. So tiny.’ Augusta glared at it. ‘How did you know?’ ‘Blood Axes.’ It thumped the crossed-axe symbol on its chest. ‘We kill. Take weapons.’ She held its red gaze. Augusta had heard of the Blood Axes, they traded with humans sometimes – it might explain why this monster was so damned clever. But not how it had known– Tanichus. The realisation came like the Light of the Emperor Himself – a ray of pure Truth. Tanichus had been here before – had lived here for months – and only Tanichus had known that the Sisters were coming. And, as Augusta remembered, he’d used his local knowledge to set the time of their reconnaissance. He’d told them when to be here. ‘Get the missionary.’ She snapped the command over the vox, saw Caia nod and turn away. ‘What did he offer you?’ she said to the warboss. It sneered at her, its red eyes cold. Reached for the grenade at its belt. She saw the motion, went to kick its wrist – but Viola was faster. Her face like stone, the youngest Sister shot it clean through the head. Gore spattered. The huge beast teetered for a second, almost as if startled – then it crashed to the floor like a tree falling. The whole building seemed to shake. A pool of crimson spread out across the flagstones. ‘Good shot,’ Augusta told the youngest Sister. Viola grinned. Behind them, Caia had returned with Tanichus, the missionary almost gibbering with fear. ‘Found him trying to flee,’ Caia said. ‘Scuttling out of the crypt like an insect.’ ‘Sister!’ The missionary was white-faced; he looked like he was about to vomit. Her armour still dripping, she walked over to him, closing her hand about his neck just like the ork’s had been about her own. He looked at her, his eyes wide, his mouth open. ‘Sister Superior, I swear by His light–’ ‘You dare? You dare swear by the Emperor’s name?’ Her hand closed; she felt his breath catch in his throat. ‘I should crush you where you stand.’ ‘Sister, please!’ At her feet, the warboss lay dead. The orks were finished and the Sisters had closed ranks at Augusta’s shoulders – the entire cathedral seemed gathered at her back, looking at the missionary. ‘You’ve been here before,’ Augusta said. ‘Lived with the townspeople. You’re the link, Tanichus. You’re the only thing that could have manipulated the pieces. Tell me, did you speak to the orks? Deal with them? Did you lie about the icon? Something to bring us out here, just so the orks could kill us for our weapons.’ She shook him like a rat. ‘Sister, I swear!’ Disgusted, she let him go, watched as Caia’s gauntleted hands closed on his shoulders and forced him to his knees. ‘Sister Kimura died,’ Augusta said. She freed the seal on her helm and took it off, enjoying the relative cool of the marsh-thick air. Meeting her flat, steel gaze, Tanichus was starting to panic. ‘Please!’ She dropped to one knee, gripped his jaw in one bloody gauntlet and forced him to look at her. ‘Repent, heretic, you may yet save your soul.’ Tanichus was shaking now, his face pale. Sweat shone from his skin. She’d seen this a hundred times in the suddenly caught-out-and-penitent – the guilt, the fear. And they were exactly the admission she was looking for. ‘Tell me the truth,’ she snarled at him. ‘What deal did you do?’ He was snivelling now, terrified. Words spilled out of him. ‘When I came here,’ he said, ‘the townspeople told me about the orks. The tribe had been destroying the villages, committing such horrors… and they were going to wipe out the town. The people told the orks about the cathedral. Said they could have anything they could find if they just left the town alone. Then I came, and they begged me for my help. They knew that the orks would come back. Knew what would happen to them.’ He seemed almost in tears. ‘They’re just people, Sister, just families. They have lives and fears and hopes. Children growing up.’ His face was etched in pain. ‘I just wanted to help them.’ He held back a sob. Augusta saw the pity on Viola’s freckled face, saw the stances of the others shift – they knew full well what the orks would have done to the towns-people. He said, ‘I went to find the orks. I told them that I would bring them weapons, armour, if they just left the people alone. And–’ ‘And so you brought them us.’ Augusta’s tone was scathing. ‘You beat them, didn’t you?’ He was pleading with her. ‘You won!’ She contemplated the sobbing man, water tracing clean lines through the filth on his skin, and she understood his pain, the choice he’d made. But it didn’t change the facts. ‘Lysimachus Tanichus, you are a traitor. You have manipulated the Adepta Sororitas to your own ends. You have betrayed the Ecclesiarchy, and the name of the Emperor.’ Tanichus opened his mouth, but she didn’t want to hear it. ‘And your story misses one critical point – what would have happened if we’d lost?’ ‘You’re Sister Superior Augusta Santorus – you don’t lose!’ ‘Tell that to Kimura.’ Tanichus glanced at the fallen Sister, then slumped forwards, defeated. He was sniffling. ‘I only wanted to help the people.’ ‘You betrayed us to the enemy.’ She backhanded him, her metal gauntlet cutting his cheek. His head snapped sideways, then he looked back up at her, uncomprehending and horrified. ‘You brought us here on a lie. You cost the life of Sister Kimura. You tried to flee the battle. Your guilt is manifest, and your life is forfeit.’ He stared at her, his mouth open. But she wasn’t done. ‘However, I will say this – this world, Lautis, in the Drusus Marches of the Calixis Sector, is now under the observation and protection of the Order of the Bloody Rose. We claim this cathedral, and all within it, in His name. And we will protect the people – on the assumption that they acknowledge the Emperor of All Mankind.’ Tanichus had fallen forwards. He was shaking, his hands over his face. ‘Please! I knew you’d beat them! I knew!’ ‘I will deliver your protection, Tanichus. But you…’ She dragged his head up again. ‘In pythonissam non patieris vivere – I shall not suffer your life.’ ‘Sister Superior…’ Viola’s voice came to her ears, not over the vox. ‘He should come back with us, face judgement–’ ‘Enough!’ Augusta snapped the order and Viola recoiled. ‘I know exactly what to do with this offal.’ ‘Sister,’ Jatoya said, more cautiously. ‘It is not our place–’ ‘He has mocked us!’ Augusta barked, furious. ‘Kimura is dead!’ Tanichus threw himself at her feet. ‘Please!’ Viola and Jatoya exchanged a glance. Augusta reached down with one hand, and dragged the sobbing man back to his feet. ‘You do not take the name of the saint in vain. You do not manipulate the Order to your own ends. And believe me, if the orks had won, both you and your town would still have been destroyed. That warboss would have cut you to pieces and eaten you.’ Tanichus was shaking now. She tore the rosarius out of his grasp, gave it to the closest of her Sisters. Then she pulled her fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour, and slit Tanichus’ throat. Augusta felt Viola flinch, though she said nothing. Tanichus gaped and fell, bubbles on his lips, hands to his throat, his blood mingling with that of the dead ork. His last word, as he hit the floor, was Mercy.",

      "content": "The cathedral’s corpse was vast. Standing in its hollow heart, its darkness vaulted huge above her, Sister Superior Augusta rested one scarlet-gauntleted hand on the bolter at her hip. She said nothing, only scanned this icon of the Emperor’s might, searching for motion, for threat, for any remaining gleam of His light. But there was nothing. This was Ultima Segmentum’s darkest corner, and little reached out here. Beside her, the missionary Lysimachus Tanichus was speaking in hushed tones. ‘From the last years of the Age of Apostasy, Sister. Or so they say.’ His sibilance coiled in the dark, like echoes of millennia. Augusta gave a brief acknowledgement and walked carefully through the debris. The air was hot here, clammy with the overgrown jungle-marsh outside; twisted creepers had penetrated the cathedral’s crumbling walls and they writhed across the stonework like the tendrils of Chaos itself. Sweat itched at the fleur-de-lys tattoo on her cheek. ‘Sisters.’ She spoke softly into the vox at her throat. ‘Roll call.’ Five voices came back through the darkness. Augusta’s retinal lenses tracked their locations: blips deployed in a standard sweep-reconnaissance pattern. Her squad were experienced – all except one – and she had complete trust in their worthiness, and in their love for the Emperor. Together, they had carried fist and faith across every segmentum of the galaxy. Tanichus, fiddling with his rosarius, spoke again. ‘The Emperor’s light had not touched this world in millennia, Sister, not until I came here, carrying His name. The local townspeople told me of the cathedral. It’s a part of their mythology–’ ‘I trust you’ve brought them Truth,’ Augusta said. Her authority was unthreatened by the missionary, but she needed to listen – the brief from the canoness on Ophelia VII had listed this world as a potential staging point for Chaos, invading from the Eye of Terror, for witchkin or renegades, for marauding xenos of every kind. Augusta was a twenty-year veteran, her bobbed hair and stern gaze both steel-grey, and her experience made her both sharp and wary. ‘Me serve vivere, Sister,’ Tanichus said. ‘I live to serve.’ ‘Sister Jatoya,’ Augusta said into the vox. ‘Anything?’ Her second-in-command responded, ‘No, Sister. If there’s anything here, it’s well hidden.’ ‘Check everywhere.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Very well.’ Her touch still on the bolter, eyeing the decaying statues and pillars above her, Augusta gestured for Tanichus to keep speaking. But he told her only what she already knew: his history with the townspeople, and their rumours of the cathedral. The town held the place taboo, but they’d told Tanichus their local myth – that the ruin had a guardian, an armoured stone icon with a bloodied flower upon its chest. And Tanichus had carried word of this back to the Ecclesiarchy, and to the Sisters. A member of the Order of the Bloody Rose, Augusta had volunteered for the mission immediately – with the cathedral’s age, it was possible that the icon could be Saint Mina herself. ‘The Emperor has called me,’ she’d said to the canoness. ‘And I must go.’ Perhaps for more political reasons than visionary ones, the canoness had agreed. Her boots crunching over ancient, fallen masonry, Augusta climbed the steps towards the high altar. Ruin or not, she paused before the top and dropped to one armoured knee, her black cloak billowing and her hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on her armour. ‘Quantus tremor est futurus, quando attingit locum Lucis.’ How great the fear will be, when the Light touches this place! She felt the missionary shiver as he, too, knelt. Tanichus was a talker, a good man to carry the Emperor’s word, but she was His daughter, and her task was clear. She would find this icon. ‘Did the townspeople tell you anything further?’ she asked, coming back to her feet. ‘You lived with them for several months.’ ‘Only superstitions,’ he told her. ‘If this is your patron saint, Sister, then we must find her without their help.’ Augusta nodded. She gave her squad orders to structure their search, to move in a standard skirmish pattern throughout the cathedral’s cloisters and side-rooms. Sister Viola, the youngest, she ordered to stand guard at the fallen doors. Viola was new from the schola; she was high-hearted and eager to prove herself and that was all very well… but Augusta wanted her close. ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola, bolter in hand, returned to the doors and took her position, watching the huge and muggy writhe of the outside jungle. Over the vox, the Sister Superior recited the Litany of Mettle. Whatever was here, they would find it. In the cathedral’s transept stood a colossal thirty-foot statue, its broken hands raised in the sign of the aquila. It had been carved in full armour and, like all such things, it faced Holy Terra as if it still sought the Light. But if this was Saint Mina, then she had no face, and her insignia had long since fallen to dust. Augusta was scanning, carefully looking for age and identity, when the cry came from Viola at the doorway. ‘Sisters!’ The word was soft across the vox, but it carried the faintest of quivers. ‘I see movement!’ Augusta felt the touch of adrenaline and inhaled, enjoying the lift, the first flush of faith – as her briefing had warned her, this was a dangerous place. ‘Be specific,’ she said, turning to crunch back out to the nave, the cathedral’s main aisle. ‘What do you see?’ ‘Large force incoming. Seventy, eighty yards. Moving slowly, but heading this way.’ Her voice was taut with fear. ‘It’s hard to see them through the jungle.’ Tanichus followed at Augusta’s shoulder. The missionary had unhooked his lasrifle and looked slightly queasy; she hoped he could shoot straight. ‘Sisters, to me. Kimura, to the doorway. Jatoya, watch the rear.’ Kimura carried the squad’s heavy bolter, and its faster suppression would be critical. ‘Viola, description.’ ‘I can’t see well, Sister, but they’re all shoulders. They’re huge!’ ‘Space Marines?’ Jatoya’s tone was surprised. ‘Out here?’ But Kimura was at the doorway now, weapon at the ready. Her voice came back over the vox, her tones shuddering with a rising, burning eagerness. ‘They’re not Heretic Astartes, Sisters.’ The words were alight. ‘They’re orks.’ Orks. If there was one damned xenos that Augusta loathed, it was the ork. Filthy, stinking things, slavering and disorderly; they were as much the enemies of the Throne as any witch or heretic. She could feel her faith unfurling in her heart like a banner – she had a chance to reclaim this holy place, at the edge of the segmentum… But Augusta’s ruthless discipline was what had kept her alive through twenty years of warfare. She could embrace the love of her Emperor and keep her thoughts clear. She reached Kimura at the doorway, and used her auspex to look outside. Immediately, she saw why Viola had made the mistake. Many of the incoming beasts were enormous, bigger than the Sisters, armour and all. But this was not the disciplined advance of highly-trained soldiers, this was ramshackle, and noisy, and slow. The orks moved more like marauders; they laughed amongst themselves, pushing and shoving and snarling. Their tones were harsh and their voices guttural. They were hard to see through the steam, through the festooned and looping creepers. But they were heading straight for the cathedral. ‘Sister!’ Kimura had reached the same conclusion – her voice was tense. Augusta saw her take a sight on the lead ork, anger radiating from her stance as if her armour burned with it. ‘Hold your fire.’ For a moment, she thought Kimura would disobey, but Augusta’s command of her squad was too strong. Instead, Kimura paused, quivering, her finger on the trigger, tracking the orks as they approached. Behind them now, Viola’s breathing was swift in her vox. She was afraid – and Augusta understood. But still, the youngest of the squad had to control herself, and quickly. Swiftly, the Sister Superior gave orders for deployment. Kimura and Caia at the door, Viola and Melia at the front left archway, Jatoya, with her flamer, watching the rear. Augusta herself, Tanichus still with her, took position at the front arch to the right, its window long since put out by the creeper and shattered to forgotten dust. Outside, the orks advanced, oblivious. A fight had broken out amongst their number, cheered and jeered by those surrounding. Beneath her helmet, Augusta curled her lip – she had no fear of these beasts, whatever their numbers. Over the vox, she recited the Battle Hymnal and heard her Sisters join her, avidly soft. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ She felt Viola stiffen, felt her courage coalesce. She felt Kimura steady, ready to unleash His wrath on the incoming creatures and their blasphemous intentions… ‘Wait,’ she said, again. The orks moved closer. Within heavy bolter range. Within bolter range. Any moment now, they would see the crouching Sisters, their blood-scarlet armour and their black-and-white cloaks… ‘Sisters, stay down. Kimura, on my command, full covering suppression. For the Emperor… Fire!’ The orks had no idea what had hit them. Raiders and warriors alike, everything vanished in a hail of gore and shredding flesh. The heavy bolter howled in Kimura’s hands, and the jungle was ripped to pieces, leaves shining like shrapnel, trees and vines cut clean in half. One ancient trunk toppled over with a groan, but was stopped by a tangle of creeper. It hung there, creaking, like some huge executioner’s axe. Kimura’s voice came over the vox, louder now, ‘A morte perpetua, Domine, libra nos!’ The Hymn of Battle raged in tune with the furious barking of the weapon. The Sisters’ voices joined her, rising to crystal-pure harmonics as Kimura visited bloody destruction upon the orks. Augusta was grinning now, tight and violent beneath her helm. She knew this with every word in her ear, every flash in her blood – this was her worship, her purpose and her life. The Emperor Himself was with her, His fire in her heart, His touch in the creak and weight of her armour, in the bolter in her hand. She was here to unleash His wrath against the despoilers of this forgotten and holy place. And it felt good. At her other hip, her heavy chainsword clanked as if begging for release, but not yet… not yet. She heard Kimura’s singing ring with vehemence as the Sister cut the orks to pieces. ‘From the blasphemy of the Fallen, our Emperor, deliver us!’ But orks, despite many flaws, had no concept of intimidation. They had no interest in the Emperor’s wrath, no tactics, and no sense. Another force might have gone to ground, given covering fire, but not these beasts. Roaring with outrage, waving what clumsy weapons they had, they simply charged. Over the singing, Augusta shouted, ‘Kimura, fall back and reload! The rest of you, fire!’ She raised her own bolter, aiming for the largest ork she could see. Greenskins had a very simple rule of leadership – the bigger the beast, the more control it wielded. And if she could take out the leaders, the rest would be easier to kill. The battle hymn still sounded and she added her voice once again, feeling the music thrill along her nerves like wildfire. A second wave of orks raged forwards, leering and eager. There seemed to be no end to them. The beasts were closing fast now, and she could see them clearly: their jutting teeth and green skin, their rusted weapons, their armour all scrappy pieces of ceramite and steel, scrounged from who knew what battlefields. One had a set of white pauldrons bearing the distinctive fleur-de-lys. Snarling, she blew it away. But their losses didn’t touch them; they picked up the weapons of their dying and their trampled, and they just kept coming. Bolters barked and howled in red-gauntleted hands. Tanichus took single shots with his lasrifle, picking his targets carefully. The jungle became a mess of blood and smoke and noise, but still the orks came on, slobbering and shouting, ripping through creepers and fallen trees. To one side, there was a lashing and a gurgle and half a dozen greenskins vanished, shrieking and struggling, below the surface of the marsh. Jeers and calls came from the rest, but they didn’t slow down. ‘There’s too many of them!’ The youngest Sister’s cry broke the hymn’s purity and Augusta felt her squad waver. She raised her voice to a paean, a clarion call like a holy trumpet, allowing them no pause. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Shrieking with fury, Viola resumed firing. But the orks didn’t care. They tore themselves free from the jungle’s tangle and threw themselves at the steps. The lead ork went backwards in a spray of crimson mist. The others were already boiling past it. Tanichus kept firing, streaks of light past Augusta’s shoulder. Augusta switched to full suppression and heard the bolters of the others, all growling in righteous fury. Yet the orks still came. They were like a rotting green tide, large creatures and small, no structure, no fear. They bayed and snarled like animals. The Sisters couldn’t stop them all. Fury rose in Augusta and was annealed to a magnesium-white flare of righteous wrath. You shall not enter here! Viola, afraid, screamed the words of the hymnal, the same verse, over and over… The advance stopped. Shredded leaves fluttered slowly to the rotting jungle floor. The orks had paused. Changing magazine with an action so reflexive she barely noticed, Augusta scanned them through her retinal lenses, wondering what in Dominica’s name they were doing. Had they just been overcome by the holiness of the cathedral itself? Somehow, she doubted it. She watched as the creatures at the front moved, taking cover behind toppled statues. She gave the order to keep firing and heard the bolters start again. The beasts knew the Sisters were here – and they’d responded. Smart orks? The idea was horrifying. Yet something down there – the warboss or whatever it was – had intelligence. It made her wonder if their presence was pure coincidence… and an odd chill went down her back. The lead orks had taken cover now, and the jungle was ominously quiet. Behind them, through the rising steam, she could see bigger figures, moving forwards. Several had stubby sidearms, luridly decorated; the weapons gave a steady bark of fire. Rounds chewed chunks out of the stone and made the Sisters keep their heads down. And one of them– ‘Get back from the windows! Take cover!’ Her squad were already on the move, throwing themselves back. They didn’t wait for the ork with the rocket launcher to loose his leering-skull-painted missile… straight into the cathedral nave. Augusta hit the floor, taking Tanichus down with her. The world erupted in fire. She heard the whistling of shrapnel, felt the whoosh of heat that seared her armour and shrivelled her cloak to tatters. The orks would use the cover of the missile to gain entrance to the building, and she was back on her feet, even as the flame was dying. ‘Sisters! Roll call!’ Tanichus was scrambling up, charred but unhurt – Augusta had covered as much of his unarmoured body as was possible. He was coughing, fumbling for his lasrifle amongst the settling dust. Five voices came back to her, making her thank the Emperor Himself for the courage and experience of her squad. The orks were on them now, piling through the doors, scrambling over the window ledges – if all else failed, Augusta would bring the building down in a final hail of rounds, and kill everything within. For the glory of the Emperor! But they were not done yet. They would fight with the Emperor Himself at their backs, and they would fight to their last breath. ‘Kimura–!’ She started to give orders to fall back, for Kimura’s heavy bolter to cover them, but her voice was lost under the detonation of a grenade, impacting right at Kimura’s feet. The Sister disappeared in a blast of smoke and fragments. Viola screamed. Chunks of roof tumbled to the floor. Tanichus scrabbled away on his backside, his rifle lost. Now, the orks were all over the nave. Augusta could see the smaller, darker gretchins, scuttling in among their boots, picking things up and shaking them and biting them, then scurrying gleefully away. Slinging the bolter, she drew the chainsword and started the mechanism. It snarled into life like pure impatience, eager for the blasphemers’ blood. Called by the rasp of the weapon, the Sisters were upon the orks with fists and feet and fury, punching one, kicking it to the floor, then ripping the axe out of its grip and using it on the one behind. Their armour, already red, slicked brighter with colours of death. But somewhere under the combat-high, Augusta was beginning to understand something: this was not just a random raid, it was too big, too clever, too strong. These orks had come here knowingly. And they’d come expecting resistance. A hand grabbed her cloak and pulled her backwards. She spun the chainsword, slashed through the neck of one ork and into the chest of another. Both went over, one still howling, and her thoughts were forgotten – she had other priorities. Stamping at the impertinent gretchins, she slashed at a third ork, and a fourth. She was wrath incarnate, the rage of the Emperor, carving flesh and bone and armour, and spraying gore like red wine. Tanichus had vanished, somewhere in the mess. Sister Jatoya shouted over the vox – the orks had got round behind them. Clever indeed. The flamer roared as Jatoya retreated, searing the enemy and sending them screaming, burning, stumbling. The wet and seething creepers started to smoke. And then, Augusta saw something else. Warboss. Throne, the beast was big! Seven and a half feet of pure, green muscle. It had metal in its ears, one lower tooth that jutted over its face, and an almost full set of armour that offered more than one well-known symbol – Blood Angels, Imperial Fists, the eight-pointed emblem of Chaos. It was a champion, and the biggest damned ork she’d ever seen. And if that thing was out here scavenging, then she was straight out of the schola. It had a sharp, sly glimmer in its red eyes – and its gaze stopped on Augusta. She snarled at it, ‘Mori blasphemus fui.’ Die, blasphemer. Around them, the melee slowed to a fluid dance of blood and blades. From the corner of her eye, Augusta saw Viola punch her scarlet gauntlet clean into an ork’s face, saw the ork rock backwards, then shake itself and grin. But her attention was still on the leader. Just as its was on her. They were the eye of the storm. The ork carried twin axes, each as long as its muscled forearm, and there was a second grenade at its belt. It said, ‘Sis-tah.’ But the snarl of the chainsword was its only reply. Not only big, but fast. Augusta was used to orks being slow, bearing down an enemy by brute force, rather than by speed or skill. Not this thing. In her mind, she recited the Litany of Blood – a reflex, a chant of pure focus. It was part of her combat training, something she’d learned at the schola, and it made her sharp, the tool of the might that flowed through her. But her first side-slash was blocked, then the second, the rasp of the chainsword rising to a scream as the axes caught in its teeth. The ork didn’t falter. It was controlled and powerful. She went backwards, parrying one blow after another, her boots scattering dust and mess and fallen ork bodies. And it came after her, its breath as foul as its coated yellow teeth. It was still talking; threats and mockery, but she had no interest in bandying words with it. It was defiler and despoiler, and it would die. Another blow, and another. She tried to press forwards, but it gave her no gap in which to strike. Around her, the rest of the squad fought with knives and fists, hammering the orks to a bloody green pulp. She saw one Sister falter, and fall to her knees. ‘Sis-tah.’ Grinning, the monster dropped both axes. It grabbed the chainsword, blades and all, in one massive hand, and tore it out of her grasp. It threw it aside. She saw Jatoya’s flamer in the corner of her vision, saw Caia and Melia together pick an ork up bodily and hurl it into a gathering of its fellows, sending all of them scattering to the floor. They would win this! It almost made her laugh, the sound like pure, righteous joy. With only her gauntlets, she threw herself at the monster. But it was too fast – it grabbed her, its chainsword-carved hand around her gorget, and it lifted her clean off the floor. Furious now, she kicked it. Again. Again. She split the beast’s lip, but its grin only widened, its teeth now streaked with its own blood. Furious, she took its wrist in her gasp and tried to twist and crush its arm, force it to drop her. It shook her like an errant underling. ‘Sister!’ Across the vox, she heard Jatoya’s cry. Her second in command couldn’t use her flamer but Jatoya barked a clear order at the rest of the squad. ‘Take it down!’ The warboss didn’t care. It shook her again, her armour clattering. ‘Sis-tah,’ it said. ‘Know you. Came to find.’ What? ‘Wait!’ The word was a gurgle over the vox. The beast was laughing at her. ‘We take all. Kill sis-tahs. Take weapons.’ Understanding grew up her spine like ice. She stared at the ork as it shook her for the third time. Take weapons. It had known that the Sisters were here! The fighting around them was beginning to lessen. The orks were faltering, and the Sisters hacked at them without mercy, driving them back. Many of the smaller beasts were dropping their weapons and running away. Jatoya had slung her flamer and fought with her fists alone; Augusta saw her punch an ork in the back of the neck, saw it stumble to its knees. One red-armoured figure – she couldn’t tell who – was walking through the mess, bolter in hand, putting single shots into struggling heaps. Another was clearing the bodies from the altar steps, and she could see the broken form of Kimura, smoke still rising from the joints in her armour. Then she saw one Sister click the neck of her helm and remove it, revealing a freckled face and bobbed red hair, all tousled and sweating. Viola. Her expression was like acid-carved steel. ‘Put her down.’ Viola raised her bolter, and took clear aim at the ork’s head. The warboss paused. Augusta saw it look round at its defeated force; saw its red eyes narrow, its lip curl. Then it let her go, and she fell, crashing to her knees on the cathedral floor. Viola came closer, the bolter aimed and steady. The ork bared its teeth at her. Impressed with the new mettle of the youngest Sister, Augusta stood up. She stepped in close to the warboss and said, ‘You knew we were here.’ Talking to the thing made her flesh crawl, but she had to know. ‘How? Who told you?’ ‘Sis-tah.’ The warboss looked from Augusta to Viola and back. It cocked its head to one side and said, ‘So fool-ish. So tiny.’ Augusta glared at it. ‘How did you know?’ ‘Blood Axes.’ It thumped the crossed-axe symbol on its chest. ‘We kill. Take weapons.’ She held its red gaze. Augusta had heard of the Blood Axes, they traded with humans sometimes – it might explain why this monster was so damned clever. But not how it had known– Tanichus. The realisation came like the Light of the Emperor Himself – a ray of pure Truth. Tanichus had been here before – had lived here for months – and only Tanichus had known that the Sisters were coming. And, as Augusta remembered, he’d used his local knowledge to set the time of their reconnaissance. He’d told them when to be here. ‘Get the missionary.’ She snapped the command over the vox, saw Caia nod and turn away. ‘What did he offer you?’ she said to the warboss. It sneered at her, its red eyes cold. Reached for the grenade at its belt. She saw the motion, went to kick its wrist – but Viola was faster. Her face like stone, the youngest Sister shot it clean through the head. Gore spattered. The huge beast teetered for a second, almost as if startled – then it crashed to the floor like a tree falling. The whole building seemed to shake. A pool of crimson spread out across the flagstones. ‘Good shot,’ Augusta told the youngest Sister. Viola grinned. Behind them, Caia had returned with Tanichus, the missionary almost gibbering with fear. ‘Found him trying to flee,’ Caia said. ‘Scuttling out of the crypt like an insect.’ ‘Sister!’ The missionary was white-faced; he looked like he was about to vomit. Her armour still dripping, she walked over to him, closing her hand about his neck just like the ork’s had been about her own. He looked at her, his eyes wide, his mouth open. ‘Sister Superior, I swear by His light–’ ‘You dare? You dare swear by the Emperor’s name?’ Her hand closed; she felt his breath catch in his throat. ‘I should crush you where you stand.’ ‘Sister, please!’ At her feet, the warboss lay dead. The orks were finished and the Sisters had closed ranks at Augusta’s shoulders – the entire cathedral seemed gathered at her back, looking at the missionary. ‘You’ve been here before,’ Augusta said. ‘Lived with the townspeople. You’re the link, Tanichus. You’re the only thing that could have manipulated the pieces. Tell me, did you speak to the orks? Deal with them? Did you lie about the icon? Something to bring us out here, just so the orks could kill us for our weapons.’ She shook him like a rat. ‘Sister, I swear!’ Disgusted, she let him go, watched as Caia’s gauntleted hands closed on his shoulders and forced him to his knees. ‘Sister Kimura died,’ Augusta said. She freed the seal on her helm and took it off, enjoying the relative cool of the marsh-thick air. Meeting her flat, steel gaze, Tanichus was starting to panic. ‘Please!’ She dropped to one knee, gripped his jaw in one bloody gauntlet and forced him to look at her. ‘Repent, heretic, you may yet save your soul.’ Tanichus was shaking now, his face pale. Sweat shone from his skin. She’d seen this a hundred times in the suddenly caught-out-and-penitent – the guilt, the fear. And they were exactly the admission she was looking for. ‘Tell me the truth,’ she snarled at him. ‘What deal did you do?’ He was snivelling now, terrified. Words spilled out of him. ‘When I came here,’ he said, ‘the townspeople told me about the orks. The tribe had been destroying the villages, committing such horrors… and they were going to wipe out the town. The people told the orks about the cathedral. Said they could have anything they could find if they just left the town alone. Then I came, and they begged me for my help. They knew that the orks would come back. Knew what would happen to them.’ He seemed almost in tears. ‘They’re just people, Sister, just families. They have lives and fears and hopes. Children growing up.’ His face was etched in pain. ‘I just wanted to help them.’ He held back a sob. Augusta saw the pity on Viola’s freckled face, saw the stances of the others shift – they knew full well what the orks would have done to the towns-people. He said, ‘I went to find the orks. I told them that I would bring them weapons, armour, if they just left the people alone. And–’ ‘And so you brought them us.’ Augusta’s tone was scathing. ‘You beat them, didn’t you?’ He was pleading with her. ‘You won!’ She contemplated the sobbing man, water tracing clean lines through the filth on his skin, and she understood his pain, the choice he’d made. But it didn’t change the facts. ‘Lysimachus Tanichus, you are a traitor. You have manipulated the Adepta Sororitas to your own ends. You have betrayed the Ecclesiarchy, and the name of the Emperor.’ Tanichus opened his mouth, but she didn’t want to hear it. ‘And your story misses one critical point – what would have happened if we’d lost?’ ‘You’re Sister Superior Augusta Santorus – you don’t lose!’ ‘Tell that to Kimura.’ Tanichus glanced at the fallen Sister, then slumped forwards, defeated. He was sniffling. ‘I only wanted to help the people.’ ‘You betrayed us to the enemy.’ She backhanded him, her metal gauntlet cutting his cheek. His head snapped sideways, then he looked back up at her, uncomprehending and horrified. ‘You brought us here on a lie. You cost the life of Sister Kimura. You tried to flee the battle. Your guilt is manifest, and your life is forfeit.’ He stared at her, his mouth open. But she wasn’t done. ‘However, I will say this – this world, Lautis, in the Drusus Marches of the Calixis Sector, is now under the observation and protection of the Order of the Bloody Rose. We claim this cathedral, and all within it, in His name. And we will protect the people – on the assumption that they acknowledge the Emperor of All Mankind.’ Tanichus had fallen forwards. He was shaking, his hands over his face. ‘Please! I knew you’d beat them! I knew!’ ‘I will deliver your protection, Tanichus. But you…’ She dragged his head up again. ‘In pythonissam non patieris vivere – I shall not suffer your life.’ ‘Sister Superior…’ Viola’s voice came to her ears, not over the vox. ‘He should come back with us, face judgement–’ ‘Enough!’ Augusta snapped the order and Viola recoiled. ‘I know exactly what to do with this offal.’ ‘Sister,’ Jatoya said, more cautiously. ‘It is not our place–’ ‘He has mocked us!’ Augusta barked, furious. ‘Kimura is dead!’ Tanichus threw himself at her feet. ‘Please!’ Viola and Jatoya exchanged a glance. Augusta reached down with one hand, and dragged the sobbing man back to his feet. ‘You do not take the name of the saint in vain. You do not manipulate the Order to your own ends. And believe me, if the orks had won, both you and your town would still have been destroyed. That warboss would have cut you to pieces and eaten you.’ Tanichus was shaking now. She tore the rosarius out of his grasp, gave it to the closest of her Sisters. Then she pulled her fleur-de-lys punch-dagger from the front of her armour, and slit Tanichus’ throat. Augusta felt Viola flinch, though she said nothing. Tanichus gaped and fell, bubbles on his lips, hands to his throat, his blood mingling with that of the dead ork. His last word, as he hit the floor, was Mercy.",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE The things were still out there. On the altar steps, Sister Felicity stood waiting for them. Her red armour was stained with gore, her black-and-white cloak in tatters. At one hip rested her now-empty bolter, at the other, her silent chainsword. A small, upright figure in the heart of the broken cathedral, Felicity stood alone. Before her, scattered about the cathedral nave, the tech-priest’s servitors lay dead, their haphazard defence overwhelmed, their repairs all brought to an unready end. Jencir had commanded them to protect, and they had done so with utter brutality, hurling rubble and using their mechanised limbs to horrific effect – yet the incoming numbers had just been too many. Overcome by the rising tide, they had fallen as they had fought – mindless to the last. In a ruined state, around the base of the steps, lay the five Sisters of Felicity’s squad, their last stand thrown down. They too had fallen fighting, blade and bolter, fist and faith, savage to the last woman. In her head, she bade them farewell: blessed be their memories. She would not be able to give them their Last Rites, but they had perished with courage, and they stood now at the hand of the Emperor. With them lay the tech-priest Jencir, his back ripped open as he’d tried to flee – not an act of cowardice, but a failed attempt to reach the exterior vox-transmitters. And finally, slumped against the ruined wall, the missionary Lyconides was too broken to stand, his last breaths now rasping bloody, his lasrifle still gripped in his hand. His other hand was in his lap, as if trying to stuff his steaming bowels back into his belly. She respected the man’s courage – he was no soldier, but he’d given his best. As Felicity listened, his final prayer drifted like a ghost across the emptiness, and was gone. ‘Requiescet in lumine suo,’ she whispered softly. Rest in His light. The missionary toppled over sideways and lay still. Down in the nave, the things yammered. They were coming closer now, skulking and sneaking – she could hear their claws scraping on the ancient stone. They were circling round to her sides, lurking in the hot, ruined darkness of transept and cloister. She could feel them pacing, feel their presence like a crawl of sweat across her skin. She didn’t know if they were taunting her, waiting to see if she would falter, or if they were simply awaiting commands – but she knew that there were dozens of them. Hundreds. She drew the chainsword. If she stood fast against the beasts’ onslaught, she thought, she may yet get a strike at their master… Before she died. Slowly, Felicity walked up the final steps. She looked back at the fallen Jencir, his eye-clusters and mechadendrites hanging damaged and broken, his red Mechanicus cloak spread about him like a pool of blood. She reached the high altar, and stopped before the final step. Above her, the great window was missing, fallen from its stone frame thousands of years before; the new electro-candles, bought as a promise of reconsecration, burned with a tiny and defiant light. Despite the creatures behind her, she took a moment to bend one knee, her free hand tracing the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour. ‘A morte perpetua. Domine, libra nos.’ And then she stood up. And turned around. The Sisters had not known. Felicity’s directive had come from Ophelia VII, direct from the canoness of her Order, Ianthe herself – and she and her squad had been sent all the way across the segmentum to this tiny world, this sweat of overgrowth and jungle. The previous deployment of Sisters had declared the location secure – they’d driven back the marauding orks, and had cleared the area enough to allow the tech-priest in. Felicity had come as security, and – more importantly – to ensure that the cathedral stayed within the ownership of the Order of the Bloody Rose, and of the Convent Sanctorum. An icon of Saint Mina, or so it was rumoured, still lay within this building – and her Order were not about to relinquish it. But their restoration had been interrupted. Jencir had raised the alarm – his deployed servitors, seeking to understand the extent of the repair, had ventured into the crypts. They’d detected movement, and the Sisters had gone down on reconnaissance. The first encounter had been small, and easily defeated. But they’d had no time. Even as they’d regrouped, taken a tactical defence position at the head of the crypt’s steps, more of the creatures had come. And then more. A welter of horrors, surging up from the depths. The servitors had been overcome in moments; the incoming beasts had seethed like nightmares, like a surge of teeth and blood. Outnumbered, surrounded, the Sisters had been cut off from their makeshift, modular habitations, and from any hope of off-planet communication. They’d done the only thing they could – they’d fought back. They’d retreated, defended the altar with every prayer, with every breath, with every last expended round… and they’d sung with the fury of it, their voices raised to the cathedral’s roofless, ruinous silence. But the things had just kept coming, mindless and slavering, attacking from every angle. Krak grenades had slain hundreds of them, brought walls down in cascading rumbles of broken stone; the creatures hadn’t cared. Felicity had seen her squad fight and fall, one after another, had watched the things dismember them, watched the creatures drag her Sisters’ limbs away in their teeth and worry at them, gnawing on them like old bones. They’d scattered the women’s remains in some deliberate pattern, some vile act of blasphemous worship. It was too hot in here, close and suffocatingly still. Under her blood-scarlet armour, sweat slid down her spine. Her gauntlet tightened on the hilt of her still-silent chainsword. Noli timere, she told them silently. I do not fear you. Felicity did not know why she still stood while the others had all perished, but she suspected that the things had some greater purpose for her, more than just their thirst for her life. Calmly, she recited the hymnal. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ And the creatures heard. They were creeping into view, now, letting her see them. They came down the aisle, and around the bases of the headless pillars; they rose up over the rubble like the slow advance of some thick, red tide. They came patiently this time, almost as if they savoured it; they came sniffing and snarling and licking, their long teeth bared and their spiked shoulders slinking low. They were taunting her, and she knew it. She raised her blade. She wanted to go down there, punish them for the deaths of her Sisters; she wanted to hack them to gobbets, pick them up and throw them against the walls, slam them into the cracked and weed-grown floor until they howled in pain and their bones broke and shattered– But she was the Emperor’s Daughter and her thoughts were clear. She stood where she was, His light at her back. The things came on, closer, closer. Their eyes were sharp as fangs, yellow and glinting. They reached the foot of the altar steps, and more and more came in behind them until the whole floor of the cathedral was alive, a writhing mass of red and glistening bodies. With a rasping snarl, she started the chainsword. The sudden roar echoed through the building, and the things leapt forwards as if goaded. They bounded up the steps, baying with impatience, jumping for her throat. ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ Die, blasphemer! She cut the first two clean in half, caught another on the backswing and sent it flying, its ribs half pulled from its body. Blood slicked her already red armour. They were all round her in moments, worrying at her cloak, their teeth and claws scraping over ceramite and plasteel. She kicked with her boots, hitting skulls and spines; the things snarled and yelped. Her free hand grabbed a leaping creature; she snapped its neck with a jerk of her wrist and threw it aside. The chainsword rasped its way through more. Her blood and voice sang. But still, they just kept coming. The cathedral was full of them, the whole floor rippling with spike-shouldered motion. They surged round her to get at Lyconides, and at the remains of the tech-priest. They threw themselves at her bodily, one after another, trying to knock her from her feet. She fought them off with knees and elbows and head-butts; she sawed into their red flesh, she kicked and stamped at them. Her free hand grabbed them by their collars and tossed them aside. But they had no regard for their own lives; they were driven by a bloodlust that burned from their skin. Ten more died, exploding into mist and gore. Twenty. Twenty-five. They just kept coming. Piles of crippled creatures grew around her, slowing their advance. One sank its teeth into her vambrace and hung from her forearm, the weight dragging at her shoulder. But she was still fighting, still singing the words of the hymnal, still defiant and exultant, still burning with her faith that was every bit as powerful as their craving for blood– They stopped. She staggered, suddenly bereft of resistance. The one on her arm hung limp; she had no recollection of having struck it. She sawed it off at the neck, watching the body detonate before it hit the floor. Recoiling almost reluctantly, the things shrank away. They growled at her, baring gore-smeared, yellow teeth. Coiling like curs, they slunk to the bottom of the steps and then stayed there, snapping at each other and pacing, restless. They watched her as they did so, their eyes burning. Felicity felt a rush of pure zeal; the Emperor was with her. She was still alive, still on her feet, still fighting. Her armour was scarred but intact. And she was still singing, her voice loud in the vox though there was no one left to hear it. But her discipline was strong – this was not victory, not yet. Those hounds were not beaten, they were waiting for something. She’d proven that she could best them, and they’d been called off… By something bigger. By something that wanted to face her itself. Not victory – but perhaps the single highest purpose of her life. Felicity was a Sister Superior of the Order of the Bloody Rose, here to reclaim this cathedral in the name of Saint Mina, and of the God-Emperor Himself. She had failed. Nevertheless, her final task was clear. Her bloody chainsword in one hand, she laid the other on the very last of her krak grenades. Whatever this warp-spawned horror may be, it did not daunt her. And she would take it down as she offered her life to the Emperor. Defended by the high walls of the Convent Sanctorum, Sister Superior Augusta wore her padded scarlet under­armour and a chasuble of black and white. Her steel-grey bob of hair fell forwards over her face as she bowed her head. Murmuring the Litany of Cleansing, she knelt upon the cold stone floor of her chamber, and she cleared her mind, her soul and her heart. Augusta was a warrior, a Daughter of the Emperor and the fighting fist of His Imperial Creed – but these ritual moments were just as sacred as the bloodshed and the battlefield. On the floor before her, laid out on its familiar red cloth, was her Sabbat-pattern ceramite armour, each piece positioned correctly, as illustrated in The Accords of ­Deacis VI. Her chainsword, stilled and silent, lay down one edge; her bolter, stripped and cleaned, on the other. The arrangement was as much a part of her as her litanies and the fleur-de-lys tattoo upon her cheek. Coloured light tumbled from her tiny, narrow window, catching the scarlet curve of her helmet and making it shine. It was dawn, and this was Lauds, and the ritual that came with each morning. She recited, ‘Et promissa – daturum adversus vires hostium Arma omnium qui oderunt nos.’ He promised that He would grant us strength to face our enemies, the weapons of all who hate us. As she intoned the words, she picked up the armour, piece by piece. She checked its fastenings, its purity seals, its strength and integrity; she studied it for damage, for cracks and dents, for uncleaned bloodstains. A Sister’s wargear was her second skin – one of the first battle-lessons Augusta had ever learned. ‘Every Sister walks with the Emperor,’ her tutor had told her, many years before. ‘But she must also depend on three things – her armour, her weapons, and her Sisters that surround her’. It was a lesson that Augusta had never forgotten. Continuing her recitation, she picked up her vambrace to check its inbuilt chrono-compass, her pauldrons, and then her breastplate to examine its semi-hidden fleur-de-lys blade. Then she laid the last piece back upon the cloth and sat back on her heels, head bowed. A familiar, armoured footstep sounded at the chamber doorway. Without turning, Augusta knew who it was, standing in the outer cloister and waiting for her to finish her morning devotions. ‘Sister Superior,’ said Sister Jatoya respectfully, as Augusta raised her head. ‘I did not wish to interrupt.’ In one smooth move, Augusta came to her feet and turned around. Her second-in-command stood waiting in the cloisters’ biolume, her head bare, her helm upturned under her arm. Her dark skin gleamed, but there was expectation in her stance – she was here with a request. Or an order. ‘You’re early,’ Augusta said. ‘Do you not have a class this morning?’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. ‘Teaching the schola’s novices the finer tricks of open-handed combat.’ She gave a faint smile, and the light from the window lit her face with the reflection of the Saint, and with the deep colours of the Bloody Rose. ‘But Canoness Ianthe has requested our presence, Sister. When our devotions are done, we’re to report to the Order chapel.’ A rush flickered through Augusta’s skin. ‘Do you know why?’ ‘No.’ Jatoya shook her head. ‘I’m not privy to such knowledge, and the servitor was little help.’ The smile spread, then faded. ‘But for the summons to come before the morning begins…’ Jatoya let the implication speak for itself. A personal summons from Canon­ess Ianthe was rare – in twenty years, half of them as the Sister Superior of her squad, Augusta had responded to maybe a dozen… and every one of them a call to war. The rush grew stronger, but it was instinctive, recognisable. It was the touch of her faith, that so-familiar flare of passion and hope. She looked up at the Saint in the window, at the holy light that haloed her stern, sword-bearing form, and gave a moment of thanks. Jatoya said softly, her tone amused, ‘I feel the nature of our devotions is about to change, Sister.’ It wasn’t Jatoya’s place to speculate – but the two women had known each other for more than a decade. They’d stood side by side against the orks on Lautis, the aeldari at Mis’bah, the tyranid invasion at the war-ravaged cities of Yulzond Cross. The trust between them was battle-honed, and strong. ‘You may be right.’ Augusta began to pick up her armour, donning it piece-by-piece – breast- and back-plate, cuisses, greaves. She closed her gorget around her throat, slung her blade at her hip, picked up her bolter and snicked the sight and magazine back into place. Then she opened the breech, sighted briefly down the barrel, and closed it again. ‘Very well,’ she said, holstering the bolter and picking up her helmet. ‘It would hardly do to keep the canoness waiting.’ They walked through the cloisters together, the huge drop of the convent’s outer walls to one side, the black rise of the Hallowed Spire to the other. The great, stained-glassaic windows ran with rain, and the blur of starships – the war vessels of the Imperium, the cargo and transport ships of the Ecclesiarchy – moved across them like shadows. The Chapel of Saint Mina was a later addition to the Convent Sanctorum, built by Deacis VI some two and a half thousand years after the ascension of Sebastian Thor. The Order of the Bloody Rose was young, but as warlike as its Saint had been, and no less militant. Walking past the votive candles and the floating cherubim, past the statues of the Saints and the engraved prayers, Augusta murmured the Litany of Mettle like a reflex, words of hope and strength. Beside her, Jatoya echoed each line. Age and faith surrounded them. Since the days of Thor himself, the Sisters of Battle had carried the flame of their devotion to all corners of the galaxy, had waged a ceaseless war against the Emperor’s foes – every witch, every mutant, every heretic, every xenos, every trace of Chaos wherever it could be found. As if eager, Augusta’s sword rattled against her thigh. She placed her hand on the pommel. Her squad been cooling their heels in the convent for almost a month – studying, practising, teaching the arts of war to their less experienced Sisters. It was rare for a veteran of Augusta’s rank to be at rest for this long, and peace was not in her nature. She missed praising the Emperor with bolter and blade. From the convent, voices began the morning hymnal, the verses immediately lifting into crystal-pure, four-part harmony. Gooseflesh prickled down Augusta’s arms. Jatoya said softly, ‘I will be glad if this hiatus is at an end. By Dominica’s eyes, if I have to spend another evening playing Tall Card…’ ‘Only because Sister Caia always wins.’ Augusta chuckled, but briefly. ‘But beware, Sister Militant. You may say those words to me, but in the presence of the canoness, you will show the proper respect.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya agreed. ‘I understand.’ She was nervous, Augusta realised – curious, as Jatoya had never once shown fear in the face of an enemy. ‘But…’ Jatoya made a final comment as they neared the chapel doors. ‘Tell me you don’t long for a new mission.’ They knew each other too well, and Augusta did not need to speak her answer aloud.",

She wanted to go down there, punish them for the deaths of her Sisters; she wanted to hack them to gobbets, pick them up and throw them against the walls, slam them into the cracked and weed-grown floor until they howled in pain and their bones broke and shattered– But she was the Emperor’s Daughter and her thoughts were clear. She stood where she was, His light at her back. The things came on, closer, closer. Their eyes were sharp as fangs, yellow and glinting. They reached the foot of the altar steps, and more and more came in behind them until the whole floor of the cathedral was alive, a writhing mass of red and glistening bodies. With a rasping snarl, she started the chainsword. The sudden roar echoed through the building, and the things leapt forwards as if goaded. They bounded up the steps, baying with impatience, jumping for her throat. ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ Die, blasphemer! She cut the first two clean in half, caught another on the backswing and sent it flying, its ribs half pulled from its body. Blood slicked her already red armour. They were all round her in moments, worrying at her cloak, their teeth and claws scraping over ceramite and plasteel. She kicked with her boots, hitting skulls and spines; the things snarled and yelped. Her free hand grabbed a leaping creature; she snapped its neck with a jerk of her wrist and threw it aside. The chainsword rasped its way through more. Her blood and voice sang. But still, they just kept coming. The cathedral was full of them, the whole floor rippling with spike-shouldered motion. They surged round her to get at Lyconides, and at the remains of the tech-priest. They threw themselves at her bodily, one after another, trying to knock her from her feet. She fought them off with knees and elbows and head-butts; she sawed into their red flesh, she kicked and stamped at them. Her free hand grabbed them by their collars and tossed them aside. But they had no regard for their own lives; they were driven by a bloodlust that burned from their skin. Ten more died, exploding into mist and gore. Twenty. Twenty-five. They just kept coming. Piles of crippled creatures grew around her, slowing their advance. One sank its teeth into her vambrace and hung from her forearm, the weight dragging at her shoulder. But she was still fighting, still singing the words of the hymnal, still defiant and exultant, still burning with her faith that was every bit as powerful as their craving for blood– They stopped. She staggered, suddenly bereft of resistance. The one on her arm hung limp; she had no recollection of having struck it. She sawed it off at the neck, watching the body detonate before it hit the floor. Recoiling almost reluctantly, the things shrank away. They growled at her, baring gore-smeared, yellow teeth. Coiling like curs, they slunk to the bottom of the steps and then stayed there, snapping at each other and pacing, restless. They watched her as they did so, their eyes burning. Felicity felt a rush of pure zeal; the Emperor was with her. She was still alive, still on her feet, still fighting. Her armour was scarred but intact. And she was still singing, her voice loud in the vox though there was no one left to hear it. But her discipline was strong – this was not victory, not yet. Those hounds were not beaten, they were waiting for something. She’d proven that she could best them, and they’d been called off… By something bigger. By something that wanted to face her itself. Not victory – but perhaps the single highest purpose of her life. Felicity was a Sister Superior of the Order of the Bloody Rose, here to reclaim this cathedral in the name of Saint Mina, and of the God-Emperor Himself. She had failed. Nevertheless, her final task was clear. Her bloody chainsword in one hand, she laid the other on the very last of her krak grenades. Whatever this warp-spawned horror may be, it did not daunt her. And she would take it down as she offered her life to the Emperor. Defended by the high walls of the Convent Sanctorum, Sister Superior Augusta wore her padded scarlet under­armour and a chasuble of black and white. Her steel-grey bob of hair fell forwards over her face as she bowed her head. Murmuring the Litany of Cleansing, she knelt upon the cold stone floor of her chamber, and she cleared her mind, her soul and her heart. Augusta was a warrior, a Daughter of the Emperor and the fighting fist of His Imperial Creed – but these ritual moments were just as sacred as the bloodshed and the battlefield. On the floor before her, laid out on its familiar red cloth, was her Sabbat-pattern ceramite armour, each piece positioned correctly, as illustrated in The Accords of ­Deacis VI. Her chainsword, stilled and silent, lay down one edge; her bolter, stripped and cleaned, on the other. The arrangement was as much a part of her as her litanies and the fleur-de-lys tattoo upon her cheek. Coloured light tumbled from her tiny, narrow window, catching the scarlet curve of her helmet and making it shine. It was dawn, and this was Lauds, and the ritual that came with each morning. She recited, ‘Et promissa – daturum adversus vires hostium Arma omnium qui oderunt nos.’ He promised that He would grant us strength to face our enemies, the weapons of all who hate us. As she intoned the words, she picked up the armour, piece by piece. She checked its fastenings, its purity seals, its strength and integrity; she studied it for damage, for cracks and dents, for uncleaned bloodstains. A Sister’s wargear was her second skin – one of the first battle-lessons Augusta had ever learned. ‘Every Sister walks with the Emperor,’ her tutor had told her, many years before. ‘But she must also depend on three things – her armour, her weapons, and her Sisters that surround her’. It was a lesson that Augusta had never forgotten. Continuing her recitation, she picked up her vambrace to check its inbuilt chrono-compass, her pauldrons, and then her breastplate to examine its semi-hidden fleur-de-lys blade. Then she laid the last piece back upon the cloth and sat back on her heels, head bowed. A familiar, armoured footstep sounded at the chamber doorway. Without turning, Augusta knew who it was, standing in the outer cloister and waiting for her to finish her morning devotions. ‘Sister Superior,’ said Sister Jatoya respectfully, as Augusta raised her head. ‘I did not wish to interrupt.’ In one smooth move, Augusta came to her feet and turned around. Her second-in-command stood waiting in the cloisters’ biolume, her head bare, her helm upturned under her arm. Her dark skin gleamed, but there was expectation in her stance – she was here with a request. Or an order. ‘You’re early,’ Augusta said. ‘Do you not have a class this morning?’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. ‘Teaching the schola’s novices the finer tricks of open-handed combat.’ She gave a faint smile, and the light from the window lit her face with the reflection of the Saint, and with the deep colours of the Bloody Rose. ‘But Canoness Ianthe has requested our presence, Sister. When our devotions are done, we’re to report to the Order chapel.’ A rush flickered through Augusta’s skin. ‘Do you know why?’ ‘No.’ Jatoya shook her head. ‘I’m not privy to such knowledge, and the servitor was little help.’ The smile spread, then faded. ‘But for the summons to come before the morning begins…’ Jatoya let the implication speak for itself. A personal summons from Canon­ess Ianthe was rare – in twenty years, half of them as the Sister Superior of her squad, Augusta had responded to maybe a dozen… and every one of them a call to war. The rush grew stronger, but it was instinctive, recognisable. It was the touch of her faith, that so-familiar flare of passion and hope. She looked up at the Saint in the window, at the holy light that haloed her stern, sword-bearing form, and gave a moment of thanks. Jatoya said softly, her tone amused, ‘I feel the nature of our devotions is about to change, Sister.’ It wasn’t Jatoya’s place to speculate – but the two women had known each other for more than a decade. They’d stood side by side against the orks on Lautis, the aeldari at Mis’bah, the tyranid invasion at the war-ravaged cities of Yulzond Cross. The trust between them was battle-honed, and strong. ‘You may be right.’ Augusta began to pick up her armour, donning it piece-by-piece – breast- and back-plate, cuisses, greaves. She closed her gorget around her throat, slung her blade at her hip, picked up her bolter and snicked the sight and magazine back into place. Then she opened the breech, sighted briefly down the barrel, and closed it again. ‘Very well,’ she said, holstering the bolter and picking up her helmet. ‘It would hardly do to keep the canoness waiting.’ They walked through the cloisters together, the huge drop of the convent’s outer walls to one side, the black rise of the Hallowed Spire to the other. The great, stained-glassaic windows ran with rain, and the blur of starships – the war vessels of the Imperium, the cargo and transport ships of the Ecclesiarchy – moved across them like shadows. The Chapel of Saint Mina was a later addition to the Convent Sanctorum, built by Deacis VI some two and a half thousand years after the ascension of Sebastian Thor. The Order of the Bloody Rose was young, but as warlike as its Saint had been, and no less militant. Walking past the votive candles and the floating cherubim, past the statues of the Saints and the engraved prayers, Augusta murmured the Litany of Mettle like a reflex, words of hope and strength. Beside her, Jatoya echoed each line. Age and faith surrounded them. Since the days of Thor himself, the Sisters of Battle had carried the flame of their devotion to all corners of the galaxy, had waged a ceaseless war against the Emperor’s foes – every witch, every mutant, every heretic, every xenos, every trace of Chaos wherever it could be found. As if eager, Augusta’s sword rattled against her thigh. She placed her hand on the pommel. Her squad been cooling their heels in the convent for almost a month – studying, practising, teaching the arts of war to their less experienced Sisters. It was rare for a veteran of Augusta’s rank to be at rest for this long, and peace was not in her nature. She missed praising the Emperor with bolter and blade. From the convent, voices began the morning hymnal, the verses immediately lifting into crystal-pure, four-part harmony. Gooseflesh prickled down Augusta’s arms. Jatoya said softly, ‘I will be glad if this hiatus is at an end. By Dominica’s eyes, if I have to spend another evening playing Tall Card…’ ‘Only because Sister Caia always wins.’ Augusta chuckled, but briefly. ‘But beware, Sister Militant. You may say those words to me, but in the presence of the canoness, you will show the proper respect.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya agreed. ‘I understand.’ She was nervous, Augusta realised – curious, as Jatoya had never once shown fear in the face of an enemy. ‘But…’ Jatoya made a final comment as they neared the chapel doors. ‘Tell me you don’t long for a new mission.’ They knew each other too well, and Augusta did not need to speak her answer aloud.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO The heavy doors creaked, loud as a declaration, and the servitor clicked as it checked and reported their presence. Ignoring it, Augusta paused in the open doorway, a draught stealing over her armour. The chapel seemed empty. It rose before the Sisters in a long hollow of pale grey, pillared and chill. Twin lines of banners, red and black and white, depicted the fleur-de-lys and the Bloody Rose of their Order. At its far end, flooding its emptiness with light, the great window portrayed the Emperor Himself, His gauntleted hands gripping the hilt of a huge, upturned blade. Sol rose behind Him, haloing Him in wonder, and the star’s bright yellow illumination slanted all the way down through the nave, and warmed the walk to His feet. Electro-candles burned upon the altar, outshone by His light. In two decades of service, Augusta still could not enter this building without a catch in her throat. She lowered her gaze and murmured a prayer. She heard Jatoya again echo her words. ‘Sister Superior, Sister Militant.’ One of Ianthe’s novitiates, robed in grey and her blonde head down, had appeared soundlessly beside them. The girl was flanked by two more servitors, each of whom carried a wide brass tray. Observing the proper respect, both women relinquished their helmets, then unclipped their bolters and laid them aside. More slowly, Augusta drew her blade and placed it, too, within the servitors’ care. She felt bereft without her weapons, but you did not enter the chapel bearing arms. The servitors retreated. ‘In the name of Saint Mina and the Golden Throne,’ Augusta said. ‘We are the willing daughters of the God-Emperor. We come at His command, and to do His bidding.’ ‘The canoness is waiting for you, Sisters,’ the novitiate said. ‘Come.’ She beckoned, and the two women followed her up towards the chancel. They passed beneath the organ’s lofty hollow, the tall lines of brass pipes that rose glittering towards the vaulted roof. They passed beneath the armoured statue of Saint Mina herself, her sword at her hip. From the window, Sol’s yellow illumination brought a touch of gentleness to her austere features. They came to the foot of the altar steps. Here, both women dropped to one knee and traced out the lines of the fleur-de-lys on their armour. Then they rose back to their feet and stood smoothly at ease, feet apart, hands behind their backs, their chins lifted and their heads bared to the light. At the foot of the pulpit, Canoness Ianthe was waiting for them. ‘Your eminence,’ Augusta said. ‘You wished our presence.’ The canoness said nothing. Tall and pale and bone-lean, her chill gaze raked both women head to foot. ‘I did,’ she said, when her examination was complete. Neither Sister reacted. Ianthe was a stern disciplinarian who kept her Order under tight control – and they both knew when not to speak. She snapped a command, and both women stamped to attention, hands to their sides, feet together. She nodded at their efficiency. Her steps quiet, she stopped before them, hair ice-white, her face lined and her tattoo faded to blue with her age. She inspected their wargear as if they stood upon a parade ground, her gaze pausing on the multiple beads on Augusta’s chaplet – her many medals of merit. Augusta had faced foes across every segmentum of the galaxy, and had never once flinched from the fight. Both women continued to stare at the steps. ‘At ease,’ Ianthe said at last. With a simultaneous stamp, they returned to their original stance. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ words seemed like an announcement. ‘Sister Militant.’ She paced before them, her rigidity uncompromised. ‘I understand that you are both becoming…’ she spun on her heel, ‘… restless… with your studies.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta answered honestly, though her gaze didn’t waver. ‘We miss the hymns of the battlefield.’ ‘I have some sympathy with your agitation, Sisters.’ Ianthe spun back again, and nodded at them, her face almost smiling. ‘These walls are holy and no foe would dare assail them. Yet it is a Sister’s place to hunt and slay the foes of the Light, wherever they may be found.’ She stopped, eyeing Jatoya, the moment of amusement gone. ‘But I take it that you comprehend your hiatus?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta said. ‘We have a new Sister in our squad, replacing Sister Kimura. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘Blessed be her memory.’ The litany was returned, and all three women observed a moment’s quiet. Ianthe said, ‘Certainly, you must be familiar with your new recruit.’ Something in her voice seemed to hint that Augusta had missed the point, but she went on, ‘You must trust her with your lives, know that you can rely upon her, know that she will praise the Emperor fearlessly, with battle, blade and bolter, just as you do.’ She spun, paced again. ‘You need to know her as well as you know all your squad.’ ‘Yes, milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Akemi is young but wise. Her skills are extensive. And this hiatus has enabled her, and us, to learn a great deal about each other.’ ‘You say “wise”, not “strong”.’ Ianthe paused, looking from one face to the other. ‘Do you consider her battle-ready, Sister Superior?’ Augusta knew her canoness well enough to realise that the question was a test in itself – an examination of her expertise, and of her knowledge of her squad. If she answered ‘yes’ simply to secure a new mission and to bring their hiatus to an end then she was not worthy of her command. But Augusta had long experience – she had been tested before and would be tested again. She answered, evenly, ‘I judge her battle-ready, milady. She shows both strength and insight. Sometimes the latter can be a strength of its own.’ ‘Just so,’ Ianthe agreed. ‘And you, Sister Militant?’ Jatoya answered, ‘I, too, would trust her with my life. She is a worthy addition to the squad.’ ‘Good.’ Ianthe said, nodding again. She resumed her pacing. Despite the location, the canoness wore her armour like a confrontation, like some constant challenge – and her own numerous merits told tales of that challenge fulfilled. Ianthe was a formidable warrior, and not one of her Order would question her. ‘Then, Sisters,’ she said, ‘I have some news for you – perhaps news you will even welcome.’ She spun on her heel and paused in front of them. ‘Your hiatus has reached its end. I have a mission for you that may test even your…’ she glanced at Augusta, ‘…considerable mettle.’ The last words were faintly edged; they carried implications that Augusta didn’t quite follow. ‘Milady?’ The canoness gave a faint, humourless smile, and continued her pacing, making them wait. At last she said, ‘How well do you remember Sister Superior Felicity Albani?’ Felicity! The name was like a shock – sudden and unexpected. Augusta knew Felicity, had known her for years. She remembered the woman from the schola, small and dark and determined, and one of the single finest swordswomen that the Order had ever seen. Carefully, she said, ‘I know Sister Felicity well, milady. We studied together.’ She paused, catching up with the implications, and then said, ‘And she commanded the squad–’ ‘That took your place. Upon Lautis.’ All signs of levity gone, Ianthe turned to face them and stopped dead, her hands behind her back. Her tone was cold, now. The light from the window made her red shoulders gleam. Caught, uncomprehending, Augusta could only stare straight ahead and say, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘The world,’ the canoness continued, ‘which you and your squad had reported secure.’ The word was an outright accusation. Augusta felt Jatoya almost flinch, but both Sisters held themselves still. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe came forwards, glared into Augusta’s face. She went on, ‘In your final report, you declared that the ork tribes upon Lautis had been slain or broken, and that the area was secure enough for the Adeptus Mechanicus to begin their analysis – and repair – of the discovered cathedral. Do you recall this report, Sister Superior?’ Still staring straight ahead, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness continued to glare. ‘You slew the ork warlord?’ ‘Not I, milady,’ Augusta told her. ‘The warlord was slain by Sister Viola Taenaris.’ ‘But the warlord was slain by your squad?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘And with the beast dead,’ Ianthe said, ‘you considered the task completed, did you not?’ ‘No, milady,’ Augusta said. Her voice was level, betraying nothing. Yet the light from the window seemed too bright; she could not have raised her gaze to Him even if she’d been permitted. Instead, she offered the contents of her report. ‘After the death of the warlord, we remained upon Lautis for fifty-seven days. We sought, and discovered, the landing point and the established base of the Crossed Axe ork tribe. Without strong leadership, we found them ­scattered and easy to defeat–’ ‘That was not the question, Sister.’ With an inhalation like annoyance, Ianthe resumed her pacing. Her shadow moved across the floor like an accusation. ‘I’m asking you whether the area was, indeed, secure.’ ‘To my knowledge, milady,’ Augusta said, ‘the area was secure.’ Ianthe continued to watch them, narrow-eyed and gauging. Above, the cherubim circled as if they were recording every word, preserving the data for the Order’s records. An error, never to be forgotten. The canoness said, ‘As of Compline yesterday, we failed to receive Sister Felicity’s regular report – and all our subsequent attempts to reach her have found only static. It has been seven days since any communications have come to us from Lautis. Attempts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to reach Jencir have been likewise unsuccessful.’ Prevented by stern discipline from doing anything else, Augusta waited for the canoness to keep speaking. ‘I need,’ Ianthe said, ‘your assurance that your reconnaissance was thorough. That there was no ork, or xenos, or taint of Chaos, remaining upon Lautis when Sister Felicity was despatched to take your place.’ The lash of her anger was strong, now. ‘Because if I discover that you were in error, Sisters, I will see you both among the Repentia.’ She had stopped again, her red shoulders seeming to fill the grey space of the chancel. ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘I gave the order, milady.’ Augusta said. Her mind recalled the cathedral ruins upon Lautis, the battle with the orks, the sweaty heat of the jungle-marsh and the poverty of the townspeople. ‘Sister Jatoya is blamele–’ ‘Silence.’ The word was not loud, but it brought Augusta to an immediate halt. The canoness flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. She said, ‘I understand that you do not always insist upon your squad’s… strictest discipline, Sister Superior. Am I correct?’ ‘Milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Upon the battlefield, our discipline and unity are without question. And, as it was my decision to execute the missionary Tanichus for his deception of the Adepta Sororitas, so it was my decision to declare the Lautis cathedral secure. Sister Jatoya is blameless in this.’ The canoness said nothing; she seemed to be considering. Above them, the Emperor watched, seeing all. ‘Very well,’ Ianthe said, at last. She gestured at the novitiate, who scurried for the doors. The girl’s place was taken by one of the servitors, who offered the canoness a data-slate. ‘Stand easy,’ she said, allowing both women to relax. She scrolled through the data, then said, ‘Sisters, your service records are flawless, both of you. You’ve served Throne and Emperor with courage and faith for more than thirty years between you, and I’ve seen you both grow from girlhood into warriors of whom I am extremely proud. But this…’ she brandished the slate, its surface glittering, ‘…this is Sister Felicity’s final report. She states that their base had been established, their perimeter defences set up. She states that the missionary Lyconides had made beneficial contact with the local town, and that the reconstructive assessment of the cathedral was commencing on schedule. The Adeptus Mechanicus have released information which corroborates this, and they add that the tech-priest’s servitors had commenced the initial works.’ Ianthe looked up, her expression cold. A warrior to her core, Augusta had little patience for politics, but she had learned at the schola that there was a strong and long-term bond between the followers of Saint Mina and the Adeptus Mechanicus. ‘Something has happened to them, Sister Superior,’ the canoness said. ‘Whether an electromagnetic storm has damaged the transmitters, or whether an unseen foe has arisen, we do not know.’ Jatoya said, ‘Permission to speak, milady.’ ‘Granted.’ ‘Is there still a ship in orbit?’ ‘There is not,’ Ianthe said. ‘The Tukril, the ship of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and its escort, the Imperial warship Kyrus, have already returned to Mars, carrying requests for Jencir’s additional supplies. They’re not due back into Lautis’ orbit for another eighty-two days.’ ‘And you want us to go with them.’ Augusta spoke the understanding aloud. ‘Milady.’ Ianthe smiled at her, her expression cold. ‘No, Sister Superior, I do not.’ The words were final, icy. ‘The Adeptus Mechanicus cannot risk more resources on a world so bereft of either wealth or merit – not until their security is assured.’ Her tone was razor sharp. ‘Sisters, you will secure the area. And, this time, without a mistake.’ Augusta still stared straight ahead, though she felt the Emperor’s Light above her, His gaze that saw all. The implication was clear: if something had happened to Felicity’s squad, then she, Augusta, was responsible – by accident, by omission, by inadequate information – and the standing of her entire Order had suffered because of it. Her squad were being sent to Lautis not because of their experience or their efficiency but to rectify that error, and to cleanse the name of the Order of the Bloody Rose. She felt Jatoya flick her a tiny, sideways glance, and realised that her second-in-command had understood the same thing. ‘Of course, milady,’ Augusta said, raising her chin. ‘This is my responsibility, and I will take it willingly upon my shoulders.’ ‘I’m glad you see this my way, Sisters,’ Ianthe commented dryly. ‘Very well then. Muster your squad, Augusta. Report to the docking bay for Matins tomorrow morning.’ She held up the data-slate. ‘And may I suggest you take the intervening time to study Felicity’s report and the information offered by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Memorise the maps, Sisters. You will be needing them.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ The Sisters responded together, watching the servitors with their brass trays as they whirred down towards the doorway. ‘Very well then,’ Ianthe said. ‘You are dismissed.’ Both Sisters came back to attention, stamped a smart about-turn and marched back down the aisle. Above them, the floating cherubim watched them go, their cold, augmetic gazes recording every step. ‘Lautis?’ Sister Viola’s freckled face showed pure surprise. ‘Again?’ The squad were gathered round a small table in the refectorium, a votive candle flickering at its centre to which to offer Grace. Augusta had called them for a briefing before they attended midday prayers and then went back to their respective classes. ‘Be mindful, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘This is not just a reconnaissance mission. The honour of our Order is in jeopardy.’ Viola grinned. ‘But – we get to kill more greenskins?’ Augusta checked a sigh. The squad’s best shot, and field-promoted to the use of its thrice-blessed heavy bolter, Viola had returned from Lautis with a foolhardy streak that verged on overconfidence. She had never questioned her orders, nor taken an uncalled-for initiative, but sometimes Augusta wondered if she had been entirely ready for the advancement. ‘Lautis is at the outermost edge of the segmentum,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘We may find bigger things than orks.’ Viola’s hand strayed to her hip, and found her empty holster. Unlike the bolters of her Sisters, her own weapon was too bulky – and too sacred – to be casually carried. She rattled her fingertips in annoyance. Caia and Melia, one pale and with hair like bronze, the other dusky-skinned and dark-eyed, exchanged a glance. As close as blood-kin, they had come up through the schola together and had fought under Augusta’s command for almost as long as Jatoya. ‘May I say something, Sister?’ The squad’s newest member, Sister Akemi, still spoke with a slight hesitation, her novitiate habits hard to leave behind. ‘Of course.’ ‘I’ve spent many years studying.’ Her eyes darted from face to face with a faint nervousness. ‘And I know that Lautis has little resource. Explorations onto its moon have found promethium deposits, but nothing worth the expense of mining. As a world, it has little or no value–’ ‘It has the kynx and lho-leaf that brought the orks in the first place,’ Melia commented. Caia chuckled. Augusta was not amused. ‘All the more reason to be wary,’ she said. ‘If something does dwell upon Lautis – and that something has faced or defeated Felicity Albani – then we will need to be on our guard.’ Her gaze travelled sternly round her squad. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Melia said. ‘I fear this rest-interval has made me cranky.’ ‘That will be rectified soon enough,’ Augusta told her, with a hint of amusement. She pushed back her chair with a loud scrape and stood up. ‘Pre-dawn muster, Sisters, at Matins, at the landing pad. And in full wargear. I will speak to the quartermaster and requisition our off-world equipment.’ She glanced up at the refectory window. ‘May we walk with the Emperor and carry His light into the very darkest reaches of the galaxy.’",

With a simultaneous stamp, they returned to their original stance. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ words seemed like an announcement. ‘Sister Militant.’ She paced before them, her rigidity uncompromised. ‘I understand that you are both becoming…’ she spun on her heel, ‘… restless… with your studies.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta answered honestly, though her gaze didn’t waver. ‘We miss the hymns of the battlefield.’ ‘I have some sympathy with your agitation, Sisters.’ Ianthe spun back again, and nodded at them, her face almost smiling. ‘These walls are holy and no foe would dare assail them. Yet it is a Sister’s place to hunt and slay the foes of the Light, wherever they may be found.’ She stopped, eyeing Jatoya, the moment of amusement gone. ‘But I take it that you comprehend your hiatus?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Augusta said. ‘We have a new Sister in our squad, replacing Sister Kimura. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘Blessed be her memory.’ The litany was returned, and all three women observed a moment’s quiet. Ianthe said, ‘Certainly, you must be familiar with your new recruit.’ Something in her voice seemed to hint that Augusta had missed the point, but she went on, ‘You must trust her with your lives, know that you can rely upon her, know that she will praise the Emperor fearlessly, with battle, blade and bolter, just as you do.’ She spun, paced again. ‘You need to know her as well as you know all your squad.’ ‘Yes, milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Akemi is young but wise. Her skills are extensive. And this hiatus has enabled her, and us, to learn a great deal about each other.’ ‘You say “wise”, not “strong”.’ Ianthe paused, looking from one face to the other. ‘Do you consider her battle-ready, Sister Superior?’ Augusta knew her canoness well enough to realise that the question was a test in itself – an examination of her expertise, and of her knowledge of her squad. If she answered ‘yes’ simply to secure a new mission and to bring their hiatus to an end then she was not worthy of her command. But Augusta had long experience – she had been tested before and would be tested again. She answered, evenly, ‘I judge her battle-ready, milady. She shows both strength and insight. Sometimes the latter can be a strength of its own.’ ‘Just so,’ Ianthe agreed. ‘And you, Sister Militant?’ Jatoya answered, ‘I, too, would trust her with my life. She is a worthy addition to the squad.’ ‘Good.’ Ianthe said, nodding again. She resumed her pacing. Despite the location, the canoness wore her armour like a confrontation, like some constant challenge – and her own numerous merits told tales of that challenge fulfilled. Ianthe was a formidable warrior, and not one of her Order would question her. ‘Then, Sisters,’ she said, ‘I have some news for you – perhaps news you will even welcome.’ She spun on her heel and paused in front of them. ‘Your hiatus has reached its end. I have a mission for you that may test even your…’ she glanced at Augusta, ‘…considerable mettle.’ The last words were faintly edged; they carried implications that Augusta didn’t quite follow. ‘Milady?’ The canoness gave a faint, humourless smile, and continued her pacing, making them wait. At last she said, ‘How well do you remember Sister Superior Felicity Albani?’ Felicity! The name was like a shock – sudden and unexpected. Augusta knew Felicity, had known her for years. She remembered the woman from the schola, small and dark and determined, and one of the single finest swordswomen that the Order had ever seen. Carefully, she said, ‘I know Sister Felicity well, milady. We studied together.’ She paused, catching up with the implications, and then said, ‘And she commanded the squad–’ ‘That took your place. Upon Lautis.’ All signs of levity gone, Ianthe turned to face them and stopped dead, her hands behind her back. Her tone was cold, now. The light from the window made her red shoulders gleam. Caught, uncomprehending, Augusta could only stare straight ahead and say, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘The world,’ the canoness continued, ‘which you and your squad had reported secure.’ The word was an outright accusation. Augusta felt Jatoya almost flinch, but both Sisters held themselves still. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe came forwards, glared into Augusta’s face. She went on, ‘In your final report, you declared that the ork tribes upon Lautis had been slain or broken, and that the area was secure enough for the Adeptus Mechanicus to begin their analysis – and repair – of the discovered cathedral. Do you recall this report, Sister Superior?’ Still staring straight ahead, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness continued to glare. ‘You slew the ork warlord?’ ‘Not I, milady,’ Augusta told her. ‘The warlord was slain by Sister Viola Taenaris.’ ‘But the warlord was slain by your squad?’ ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘And with the beast dead,’ Ianthe said, ‘you considered the task completed, did you not?’ ‘No, milady,’ Augusta said. Her voice was level, betraying nothing. Yet the light from the window seemed too bright; she could not have raised her gaze to Him even if she’d been permitted. Instead, she offered the contents of her report. ‘After the death of the warlord, we remained upon Lautis for fifty-seven days. We sought, and discovered, the landing point and the established base of the Crossed Axe ork tribe. Without strong leadership, we found them ­scattered and easy to defeat–’ ‘That was not the question, Sister.’ With an inhalation like annoyance, Ianthe resumed her pacing. Her shadow moved across the floor like an accusation. ‘I’m asking you whether the area was, indeed, secure.’ ‘To my knowledge, milady,’ Augusta said, ‘the area was secure.’ Ianthe continued to watch them, narrow-eyed and gauging. Above, the cherubim circled as if they were recording every word, preserving the data for the Order’s records. An error, never to be forgotten. The canoness said, ‘As of Compline yesterday, we failed to receive Sister Felicity’s regular report – and all our subsequent attempts to reach her have found only static. It has been seven days since any communications have come to us from Lautis. Attempts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to reach Jencir have been likewise unsuccessful.’ Prevented by stern discipline from doing anything else, Augusta waited for the canoness to keep speaking. ‘I need,’ Ianthe said, ‘your assurance that your reconnaissance was thorough. That there was no ork, or xenos, or taint of Chaos, remaining upon Lautis when Sister Felicity was despatched to take your place.’ The lash of her anger was strong, now. ‘Because if I discover that you were in error, Sisters, I will see you both among the Repentia.’ She had stopped again, her red shoulders seeming to fill the grey space of the chancel. ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘I gave the order, milady.’ Augusta said. Her mind recalled the cathedral ruins upon Lautis, the battle with the orks, the sweaty heat of the jungle-marsh and the poverty of the townspeople. ‘Sister Jatoya is blamele–’ ‘Silence.’ The word was not loud, but it brought Augusta to an immediate halt. The canoness flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. She said, ‘I understand that you do not always insist upon your squad’s… strictest discipline, Sister Superior. Am I correct?’ ‘Milady,’ Augusta said. ‘Upon the battlefield, our discipline and unity are without question. And, as it was my decision to execute the missionary Tanichus for his deception of the Adepta Sororitas, so it was my decision to declare the Lautis cathedral secure. Sister Jatoya is blameless in this.’ The canoness said nothing; she seemed to be considering. Above them, the Emperor watched, seeing all. ‘Very well,’ Ianthe said, at last. She gestured at the novitiate, who scurried for the doors. The girl’s place was taken by one of the servitors, who offered the canoness a data-slate. ‘Stand easy,’ she said, allowing both women to relax. She scrolled through the data, then said, ‘Sisters, your service records are flawless, both of you. You’ve served Throne and Emperor with courage and faith for more than thirty years between you, and I’ve seen you both grow from girlhood into warriors of whom I am extremely proud. But this…’ she brandished the slate, its surface glittering, ‘…this is Sister Felicity’s final report. She states that their base had been established, their perimeter defences set up. She states that the missionary Lyconides had made beneficial contact with the local town, and that the reconstructive assessment of the cathedral was commencing on schedule. The Adeptus Mechanicus have released information which corroborates this, and they add that the tech-priest’s servitors had commenced the initial works.’ Ianthe looked up, her expression cold. A warrior to her core, Augusta had little patience for politics, but she had learned at the schola that there was a strong and long-term bond between the followers of Saint Mina and the Adeptus Mechanicus. ‘Something has happened to them, Sister Superior,’ the canoness said. ‘Whether an electromagnetic storm has damaged the transmitters, or whether an unseen foe has arisen, we do not know.’ Jatoya said, ‘Permission to speak, milady.’ ‘Granted.’ ‘Is there still a ship in orbit?’ ‘There is not,’ Ianthe said. ‘The Tukril, the ship of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and its escort, the Imperial warship Kyrus, have already returned to Mars, carrying requests for Jencir’s additional supplies. They’re not due back into Lautis’ orbit for another eighty-two days.’ ‘And you want us to go with them.’ Augusta spoke the understanding aloud. ‘Milady.’ Ianthe smiled at her, her expression cold. ‘No, Sister Superior, I do not.’ The words were final, icy. ‘The Adeptus Mechanicus cannot risk more resources on a world so bereft of either wealth or merit – not until their security is assured.’ Her tone was razor sharp. ‘Sisters, you will secure the area. And, this time, without a mistake.’ Augusta still stared straight ahead, though she felt the Emperor’s Light above her, His gaze that saw all. The implication was clear: if something had happened to Felicity’s squad, then she, Augusta, was responsible – by accident, by omission, by inadequate information – and the standing of her entire Order had suffered because of it. Her squad were being sent to Lautis not because of their experience or their efficiency but to rectify that error, and to cleanse the name of the Order of the Bloody Rose. She felt Jatoya flick her a tiny, sideways glance, and realised that her second-in-command had understood the same thing. ‘Of course, milady,’ Augusta said, raising her chin. ‘This is my responsibility, and I will take it willingly upon my shoulders.’ ‘I’m glad you see this my way, Sisters,’ Ianthe commented dryly. ‘Very well then. Muster your squad, Augusta. Report to the docking bay for Matins tomorrow morning.’ She held up the data-slate. ‘And may I suggest you take the intervening time to study Felicity’s report and the information offered by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Memorise the maps, Sisters. You will be needing them.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ The Sisters responded together, watching the servitors with their brass trays as they whirred down towards the doorway. ‘Very well then,’ Ianthe said. ‘You are dismissed.’ Both Sisters came back to attention, stamped a smart about-turn and marched back down the aisle. Above them, the floating cherubim watched them go, their cold, augmetic gazes recording every step. ‘Lautis?’ Sister Viola’s freckled face showed pure surprise. ‘Again?’ The squad were gathered round a small table in the refectorium, a votive candle flickering at its centre to which to offer Grace. Augusta had called them for a briefing before they attended midday prayers and then went back to their respective classes. ‘Be mindful, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘This is not just a reconnaissance mission. The honour of our Order is in jeopardy.’ Viola grinned. ‘But – we get to kill more greenskins?’ Augusta checked a sigh. The squad’s best shot, and field-promoted to the use of its thrice-blessed heavy bolter, Viola had returned from Lautis with a foolhardy streak that verged on overconfidence. She had never questioned her orders, nor taken an uncalled-for initiative, but sometimes Augusta wondered if she had been entirely ready for the advancement. ‘Lautis is at the outermost edge of the segmentum,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘We may find bigger things than orks.’ Viola’s hand strayed to her hip, and found her empty holster. Unlike the bolters of her Sisters, her own weapon was too bulky – and too sacred – to be casually carried. She rattled her fingertips in annoyance. Caia and Melia, one pale and with hair like bronze, the other dusky-skinned and dark-eyed, exchanged a glance. As close as blood-kin, they had come up through the schola together and had fought under Augusta’s command for almost as long as Jatoya. ‘May I say something, Sister?’ The squad’s newest member, Sister Akemi, still spoke with a slight hesitation, her novitiate habits hard to leave behind. ‘Of course.’ ‘I’ve spent many years studying.’ Her eyes darted from face to face with a faint nervousness. ‘And I know that Lautis has little resource. Explorations onto its moon have found promethium deposits, but nothing worth the expense of mining. As a world, it has little or no value–’ ‘It has the kynx and lho-leaf that brought the orks in the first place,’ Melia commented. Caia chuckled. Augusta was not amused. ‘All the more reason to be wary,’ she said. ‘If something does dwell upon Lautis – and that something has faced or defeated Felicity Albani – then we will need to be on our guard.’ Her gaze travelled sternly round her squad. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Melia said. ‘I fear this rest-interval has made me cranky.’ ‘That will be rectified soon enough,’ Augusta told her, with a hint of amusement. She pushed back her chair with a loud scrape and stood up. ‘Pre-dawn muster, Sisters, at Matins, at the landing pad. And in full wargear. I will speak to the quartermaster and requisition our off-world equipment.’ She glanced up at the refectory window. ‘May we walk with the Emperor and carry His light into the very darkest reaches of the galaxy.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE The shuttle’s cargo bay was cold. Strapped into her seat, her back to the cold metal wall, Augusta cast an eye over their requisitioned gear – Phaeton-pattern reinforcement kits, field generators, new vox-antennae, everything they would need to secure the basecamp. They were thirty-seven days out of Ophelia VII, and this trip down to Lautis’ surface was the very last leg of the journey. She spoke into the internal vox. ‘Shipmaster, how long?’ The commander of the Imperial vessel Sorex, now in parked orbit about the planet, had insisted upon piloting the shuttle personally – perhaps to ensure that the Sisters were delivered safely, and that he’d discharged his responsibility without mishap. His voice came back to them. ‘Two minutes ‘til we drop below the cloudline, Sister. Twenty-three to the landing point.’ The shuttle’s interior screen showed a continuous, passing rush of grey, soupy cloud. ‘Current data shows climate conditions at sixty-eight per cent humidity, atmospheric temperature at twenty-nine-point-five degrees. It’s a swamp down there.’ Caia muttered, ‘We know.’ ‘Any communications?’ Augusta said. ‘We’re just getting static. Full surface scan commencing as soon as we hit optimum range.’ Jatoya asked, ‘Signs of hostility?’ ‘Nothing that doesn’t belong,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Life signs are minimal and all fully indigenous. Just the local predators, Sisters, nothing you’re not expecting.’ The screen showed more clouds. ‘How long before we’re in visual range of the town?’ Augusta asked. ‘Fourteen minutes,’ he said. ‘Will keep you updated.’ ‘Thank you.’ Viola, her heavy bolter now rested across her lap, voiced a curse. ‘I’ll be glad when we’re off this blood boat.’ ‘Blood boat?’ Akemi asked her, puzzled. ‘What is a blood boat?’ The newest Sister had a little fetish that she toyed with constantly, a tiny, silver feather that she flicked endlessly between the fingers of her left hand. ‘Old Imperial slang,’ Augusta said. ‘It means a cargo ship that travels a very long way, usually to secure grox-meat or similar.’ Frowning, her small, pallid face ever-serious, Akemi nodded. Augusta could see her twisting the little feather and filing the information away, every last detail where it belonged. Akemi had a remarkable memory; she had almost taken her Oath to the Convent’s Order Dialogous, the Order of the Quill. Now, fielded for the first time as a sworn soldier and a member of the Bloody Rose, her tension was becoming apparent. Yet Augusta had no doubts about the young woman’s readiness. The Sister Superior had spent the five weeks of their interstellar journey running her squad through endless pattern-drills and live-fire training manoeuvres. They’d jogged round the gantries, morning and night, in full wargear; they’d practised skirmish exercises until they knew and could anticipate each other’s reactions. And they’d observed their rituals of daily prayer – Matins, Lauds, Vespers, Compline – in the Sorex’s tiny chapel. The screen showed a brief flash of Lautis’ bloated, orangish sun, and Akemi’s little fetish glinted in the light. As if suddenly aware of her habit, she slipped it back into the cuff of her vambrace, then leaned back against the wall. Augusta could see her lips moving as she prayed. Throughout their journey, the Navy crew had stayed well away from the Sisters – too intimidated or awed by their presence, or by the legends that accompanied them. Sometimes, greatly daring, they’d watched from the farthest walkways, and once, goaded by mocking colleagues, a young officer had called a lewd remark at Akemi’s armoured back. The shipmaster had slung the man in the brig and had reminded the crew that the Sisters were servants of the God-Emperor, and soldiers like themselves. They were not saints to be iconised – the thought was outright blasphemy – nor objects to be ogled. Once the young man had been released, Sister Akemi had spoken to him face-to-face. Augusta didn’t know what she had said, but the man had left with his skin ashen and his knees shaking. And so, Augusta had thought, do the legends perpetuate themselves. But still, it had allayed any flickering doubt: Akemi had courage. The Emperor had called her to be a warrior, and a warrior she would be. ‘Reaching optimum range now, Sisters,’ said the shipmaster. ‘Scan of township commencing.’ The clouds had thinned to wisps and were parting completely as the shuttle dropped below their cover. The screen began to show a dull, greenish atmosphere, heavy with rising steam and trapped heat. Augusta studied it carefully, remembering an identical scan from their initial reconnaissance trip, now almost a Solar year before. Her hand touched the fleur-de-lys on her breastplate. ‘Lautis.’ Caia, sat next to her, gave a faint groan. ‘Not somewhere I ever needed to see a second time.’ Melia said, ‘At least we know what to expect.’ ‘Do we?’ Caia answered her. Always the sharpest of the squad, Sister Caia missed little. ‘Do we really?’ Her words were met with silence as their import sank home. The shuttle slowed, descending further, and the passing seethe of jungle became more visible. There were the familiar festoons of creepers, and the marshy deceits of the underlying swamp. There was the dark, volcanic rock, jagged and pitted with holes. There was the rising outcry of the indigenous wildlife, the loud and colourful birds and the lurking monsters of the stagnant water. Eyeing the waiting mire, Augusta’s belly tightened with the descent. Like Caia, she had not expected to come back here. The area was secure, she reminded herself. We slew the warlord. We hunted down the scattered remnants of its tribe. We offered the town our protection. She wanted to try her vox, to try to reach Felicity on the Order’s private channel, but she was still out of range. Data flickered across the bottom of the pict-screen, showing the angle of the planet’s rotation, its climate and weather systems, its twenty-two hour day. She reminded herself of the information as she studied the passing rush of the native flora, and searched for the particular pattern that marked the town itself – the habitation closest to the ruined cathedral. ‘Threat level green,’ the shipmaster said. ‘You’re in the clear. Requested landmark becoming visible in three… two… one…’ There was a faint note of relief in his voice as he said, ‘And there we are, right on schedule. Final approach now. Praise the God-Emperor, Sisters, we’re safe and sound.’ Augusta undid her straps and stood up, her back stiff. With one hand on the shuttle’s roof to steady herself, she came forwards to scrutinise the screen. And there it was: the looming, crumbling mass of the cathedral’s ruin, and, slightly closer, the square, black shape that was the town’s ancient ziggurat, its icon, temple and government. Around it spread the familiar mosaic of dark, stone buildings and odd, right-angled roads. To one side, there was the brief, rippling flash of moving water. Her belly lurched again as the shuttle slowed further. That was the same town, the one they’d saved, the place for which Sister Kimura had given her life. They’d given Kimura her Last Rites in the ruined cathedral, but the townspeople had celebrated her memory and their own gratitude. They’d raised firebrands to the Emperor’s name, singing hymns of local tradition. Carved into the stepped sides of the great ziggurat, Augusta remembered, there were armoured warriors, their features blunted, their weapons and armour stylised, but recognisable – symbols left over from the Great Crusade. Lautis was older than the Order, older than the Sisters themselves. And yet the town’s priest – she remembered the woman clearly – had understood the Sisters’ faith and their love for their Emperor. She had pointed at the ziggurat’s carvings and talked about their local legends– ‘No life signs,’ the shipmaster said. What? The comment stopped Augusta dead. Uncomprehending, she studied the screen. Though they were still too far away, she found herself searching for movement, for some way to deny the man’s words. Behind her, her squad were suddenly tense. Viola’s hands tightened on the heavy bolter; Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, turning over and over. Surprise and concern shot from Sister to Sister along the inside of the cargo bay. Augusta said, her tone grim, ‘Scan again.’ ‘Aye.’ Side-rockets fired. The floor tilted as the vessel turned, and Augusta caught at a rivet-studded upright to keep her feet. After a moment, the shipmaster said, ‘Scan radius expanding. Two miles from grid one-niner-seven by three-forty-five.’ There was a longer pause, and he repeated, ‘No life signs, Sister. Nothing. Not even the predators.’ ‘But…’ Viola sounded as shocked as Augusta felt, ‘…there’s a whole town down there.’ Felicity’s final report had said nothing about the town being threatened, nor about any incoming force or foe. Augusta said, ‘That township’s home to over three thousand people.’ ‘Sister.’ The shipmaster’s voice held respect, and complete certainty. ‘There’s no one down there.’ ‘Can you get a signal?’ The others were standing up now, checking weapons and wargear. The first flickerings of combat-readiness were stealing through the inside of the shuttle. ‘No communications, Sister,’ he returned, his tone even. ‘Even this close, there’s no response from the basecamp. Will keep trying.’ ‘Rotate frequencies,’ Augusta said. ‘Try every Imperial channel.’ ‘Trying all Imperial and all known Mechanicus frequencies, Sister. There’s no response.’ Akemi dropped her fetish and leaned over to pick it up. In the faint, green light, her small face was etched with worry. Viola’s fingers traced the carvings and the purity seals on the Godwyn-pattern heavy bolter. Aware of their tension, Augusta still watched the screen. The absence of the townspeople was a significant shift in their mission parameters – and removed almost all possibility that Felicity’s silence had been caused by some errant storm. It also meant that the townspeople could offer them neither information nor supplies. The Arvus was slowing still further now, dropping below the canopy; it smashed through the jungle, dense and green. Brackish, noxious waters reflected the vehicle’s belly-lights, and the pitted, dark stone of the town’s outer walls grew closer. Akemi’s gaze flicked back and forth, reading the scrolling data. Melia’s hand touched her fleur-de-lys, while Caia fiddled with the sight on her bolter, clicking and unclicking it, again and again. In the metal walls of the shuttle, the noise was oddly loud. The shipmaster’s voice said, ‘Do you wish to return to the Sorex, Sisters?’ ‘We do not,’ Augusta said. ‘Our mission is very clear. Take us to the landing point, shipmaster, and drop the hatch. Once our gear is unloaded, I want you out of here. Upon your return to the Sorex, please upload what we have found so far. We do not know what waits for us, but I wish the canoness to be aware of the situation.’ She didn’t need to add: In case we cannot make that communication ourselves. ‘Yes, Sister,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Landing point ETA, two minutes.’ The screen became murkier as the vessel passed into the treeline. The cargo bay seemed suddenly very dark. Caia’s clicking stopped. In the faint, greenish light, Augusta looked at her squad. ‘Very well.’ She was alert now, her mind sharp and working – they were in the field, and this was no time for doubt or hesitation. ‘Listen to me. When that hatch comes down, Viola, out and on point. Caia, Melia, you’ll take back up. Jatoya, Akemi, with me – we’ll need to unload our gear and let this shuttle get back into the air. It’s vulnerable, and I need it safely away.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘And once we’re down, our first priority is to secure the basecamp. Jatoya, take Viola, Caia and Melia. Do a full sweep and establish the perimeter. Akemi, with me – I’ll need you to access the camp’s records.’ She glanced at the young woman, her black hair shining. ‘You read machine dialect, yes?’ ‘A little, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘My training was very basic.’ ‘Good enough. See if you can get into Jencir’s records as well as Felicity’s.’ Augusta’s smile was grim, humourless. ‘You never know what you might find.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘I’ll take the field emitters and the gun emplacements, make sure everything is rearmed and fully operational. And once we’re secure, we’re going into that town.’ She was still watching the scan, watching the rising blur of stone that was the ziggurat, now looming close. ‘From this point, Sisters, we assume that Felicity’s squad has passed into the Emperor’s blessing, that the area is hostile, and that this is a full combat mission.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ They saluted her, fists to chestplates. ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘And may His light be with us all.’ Akemi dropped her fetish back into her vambrace. She picked up her helm, dropped it over her head, and twisted the seal closed. ‘Approaching the landing point,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Dropping speed-flaps now. Thirty seconds.’ Augusta could feel the vessel lowering, slowing to a hover. Her ears popped, and she lifted her own helm and snapped it into place. She flicked off the safety on her bolter, checked its ammo for the fourth time, and laid her other hand on her chainsword. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The alarm on the rear hatch started to blare. The lock released with an audible clunk. Hydraulics whined. Like uncoiling ribbons, light and steam stole down into the cargo-bay. Viola was already on her feet, heavy bolter in both hands. To Augusta, she looked like she wanted to fight. The Arvus hovered, jet engines thundering. The air reeked of promethium fuel and shimmered with oily heat. Bright belly lights showed the landing area – an open surface of cracked, dark stone that bordered the town on one side. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Under the engines’ noise, the words of the Litany of Battle flowed, steadying them. Line and verse wove from one voice to the next over the vox – where one Sister paused, another would take up the words, and the prayer rolled through and around them all, reminding them that this was His work, that they were here in His name. Here, upon Lautis. Again. Perhaps, Augusta thought, they were hoping that Felicity would hear them. The shuttle door lowered more fully, and the thick mist of the jungle flooded the back of the vehicle. Looking out at the swamp, the Sister Superior felt a pang of unease. She came to the side of the ramp to see more clearly, and saw that the rock of the landing area was speckled with green. There was only a tiny amount, but gentle, curling fronds of jungle vegetation had crept between the slabs, up through the various cracks. Small, perhaps, but with enough time, they could shatter the rock asunder. Obsessive to a fault, no tech-priest would permit such carelessness – no one had been out here in weeks. The lowering hatch thunked to a stop. Viola was already moving, boots crashing down the ramp, heavy bolter to her shoulder. She jumped from the ramp’s edge, landing in a combat kneel and moving her weapon in steady arcs. The heat of jet and jungle would confuse the preysight in her helmet, but Viola had the vehicle at her back and a clear field of fire – if anything moved, she’d see it. Nothing moved. Caia and Melia followed at a low run, dropping from the edge of the ramp. They crouched to offer Viola cover as she dashed forwards again. The Sisters’ skirmish-deployment was perfect, a smoothly functioning combat-machine. Their voices came back over the vox, now together, united in a quiet, steady chant of the hymnal – not the harmonised rage of full-on warfare, but the calm, clear caution of routine scouting. The still-firing engines drowned other noises out. The Arvus dangled in place, three inches above the stone ground, waiting. ‘Jatoya!’ Shouting to make herself heard, the Sister Superior instructed Jatoya to take the position at the ramp’s foot, flamer covering the approach. Then she gestured for Akemi to give her a hand with the gear. One by one, the two women threw the heavy cases out of the back of the shuttle. Silently cursing the absence of loaders, Augusta kept her bolter and chainsword holstered, and gestured to the side of the landing area, where the walls of the township could be clearly seen. ‘Over there! Stack it by the watchpost!’ The cathedral, further back and on the other side of the town, had faded to a shadowy blur, drowned in the planet’s noxious mist and the colossal overgrowth of flora. ‘Viola! Advance and secure the basecamp area! Caia, Melia, with Viola. Jatoya, Akemi, with me! Let’s get out of here!’ Breathless from the heat, ducking the noise of the Arvus and its hot convection winds, the Sisters picked up their gear and ran for the camp. Once they were clear, the shuttle lifted to the top of the canopy, its lights bright. It hovered there a moment, almost as if it were waiting for something, then it turned, and was swallowed by the trees.",

Twenty-three to the landing point.’ The shuttle’s interior screen showed a continuous, passing rush of grey, soupy cloud. ‘Current data shows climate conditions at sixty-eight per cent humidity, atmospheric temperature at twenty-nine-point-five degrees. It’s a swamp down there.’ Caia muttered, ‘We know.’ ‘Any communications?’ Augusta said. ‘We’re just getting static. Full surface scan commencing as soon as we hit optimum range.’ Jatoya asked, ‘Signs of hostility?’ ‘Nothing that doesn’t belong,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Life signs are minimal and all fully indigenous. Just the local predators, Sisters, nothing you’re not expecting.’ The screen showed more clouds. ‘How long before we’re in visual range of the town?’ Augusta asked. ‘Fourteen minutes,’ he said. ‘Will keep you updated.’ ‘Thank you.’ Viola, her heavy bolter now rested across her lap, voiced a curse. ‘I’ll be glad when we’re off this blood boat.’ ‘Blood boat?’ Akemi asked her, puzzled. ‘What is a blood boat?’ The newest Sister had a little fetish that she toyed with constantly, a tiny, silver feather that she flicked endlessly between the fingers of her left hand. ‘Old Imperial slang,’ Augusta said. ‘It means a cargo ship that travels a very long way, usually to secure grox-meat or similar.’ Frowning, her small, pallid face ever-serious, Akemi nodded. Augusta could see her twisting the little feather and filing the information away, every last detail where it belonged. Akemi had a remarkable memory; she had almost taken her Oath to the Convent’s Order Dialogous, the Order of the Quill. Now, fielded for the first time as a sworn soldier and a member of the Bloody Rose, her tension was becoming apparent. Yet Augusta had no doubts about the young woman’s readiness. The Sister Superior had spent the five weeks of their interstellar journey running her squad through endless pattern-drills and live-fire training manoeuvres. They’d jogged round the gantries, morning and night, in full wargear; they’d practised skirmish exercises until they knew and could anticipate each other’s reactions. And they’d observed their rituals of daily prayer – Matins, Lauds, Vespers, Compline – in the Sorex’s tiny chapel. The screen showed a brief flash of Lautis’ bloated, orangish sun, and Akemi’s little fetish glinted in the light. As if suddenly aware of her habit, she slipped it back into the cuff of her vambrace, then leaned back against the wall. Augusta could see her lips moving as she prayed. Throughout their journey, the Navy crew had stayed well away from the Sisters – too intimidated or awed by their presence, or by the legends that accompanied them. Sometimes, greatly daring, they’d watched from the farthest walkways, and once, goaded by mocking colleagues, a young officer had called a lewd remark at Akemi’s armoured back. The shipmaster had slung the man in the brig and had reminded the crew that the Sisters were servants of the God-Emperor, and soldiers like themselves. They were not saints to be iconised – the thought was outright blasphemy – nor objects to be ogled. Once the young man had been released, Sister Akemi had spoken to him face-to-face. Augusta didn’t know what she had said, but the man had left with his skin ashen and his knees shaking. And so, Augusta had thought, do the legends perpetuate themselves. But still, it had allayed any flickering doubt: Akemi had courage. The Emperor had called her to be a warrior, and a warrior she would be. ‘Reaching optimum range now, Sisters,’ said the shipmaster. ‘Scan of township commencing.’ The clouds had thinned to wisps and were parting completely as the shuttle dropped below their cover. The screen began to show a dull, greenish atmosphere, heavy with rising steam and trapped heat. Augusta studied it carefully, remembering an identical scan from their initial reconnaissance trip, now almost a Solar year before. Her hand touched the fleur-de-lys on her breastplate. ‘Lautis.’ Caia, sat next to her, gave a faint groan. ‘Not somewhere I ever needed to see a second time.’ Melia said, ‘At least we know what to expect.’ ‘Do we?’ Caia answered her. Always the sharpest of the squad, Sister Caia missed little. ‘Do we really?’ Her words were met with silence as their import sank home. The shuttle slowed, descending further, and the passing seethe of jungle became more visible. There were the familiar festoons of creepers, and the marshy deceits of the underlying swamp. There was the dark, volcanic rock, jagged and pitted with holes. There was the rising outcry of the indigenous wildlife, the loud and colourful birds and the lurking monsters of the stagnant water. Eyeing the waiting mire, Augusta’s belly tightened with the descent. Like Caia, she had not expected to come back here. The area was secure, she reminded herself. We slew the warlord. We hunted down the scattered remnants of its tribe. We offered the town our protection. She wanted to try her vox, to try to reach Felicity on the Order’s private channel, but she was still out of range. Data flickered across the bottom of the pict-screen, showing the angle of the planet’s rotation, its climate and weather systems, its twenty-two hour day. She reminded herself of the information as she studied the passing rush of the native flora, and searched for the particular pattern that marked the town itself – the habitation closest to the ruined cathedral. ‘Threat level green,’ the shipmaster said. ‘You’re in the clear. Requested landmark becoming visible in three… two… one…’ There was a faint note of relief in his voice as he said, ‘And there we are, right on schedule. Final approach now. Praise the God-Emperor, Sisters, we’re safe and sound.’ Augusta undid her straps and stood up, her back stiff. With one hand on the shuttle’s roof to steady herself, she came forwards to scrutinise the screen. And there it was: the looming, crumbling mass of the cathedral’s ruin, and, slightly closer, the square, black shape that was the town’s ancient ziggurat, its icon, temple and government. Around it spread the familiar mosaic of dark, stone buildings and odd, right-angled roads. To one side, there was the brief, rippling flash of moving water. Her belly lurched again as the shuttle slowed further. That was the same town, the one they’d saved, the place for which Sister Kimura had given her life. They’d given Kimura her Last Rites in the ruined cathedral, but the townspeople had celebrated her memory and their own gratitude. They’d raised firebrands to the Emperor’s name, singing hymns of local tradition. Carved into the stepped sides of the great ziggurat, Augusta remembered, there were armoured warriors, their features blunted, their weapons and armour stylised, but recognisable – symbols left over from the Great Crusade. Lautis was older than the Order, older than the Sisters themselves. And yet the town’s priest – she remembered the woman clearly – had understood the Sisters’ faith and their love for their Emperor. She had pointed at the ziggurat’s carvings and talked about their local legends– ‘No life signs,’ the shipmaster said. What? The comment stopped Augusta dead. Uncomprehending, she studied the screen. Though they were still too far away, she found herself searching for movement, for some way to deny the man’s words. Behind her, her squad were suddenly tense. Viola’s hands tightened on the heavy bolter; Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, turning over and over. Surprise and concern shot from Sister to Sister along the inside of the cargo bay. Augusta said, her tone grim, ‘Scan again.’ ‘Aye.’ Side-rockets fired. The floor tilted as the vessel turned, and Augusta caught at a rivet-studded upright to keep her feet. After a moment, the shipmaster said, ‘Scan radius expanding. Two miles from grid one-niner-seven by three-forty-five.’ There was a longer pause, and he repeated, ‘No life signs, Sister. Nothing. Not even the predators.’ ‘But…’ Viola sounded as shocked as Augusta felt, ‘…there’s a whole town down there.’ Felicity’s final report had said nothing about the town being threatened, nor about any incoming force or foe. Augusta said, ‘That township’s home to over three thousand people.’ ‘Sister.’ The shipmaster’s voice held respect, and complete certainty. ‘There’s no one down there.’ ‘Can you get a signal?’ The others were standing up now, checking weapons and wargear. The first flickerings of combat-readiness were stealing through the inside of the shuttle. ‘No communications, Sister,’ he returned, his tone even. ‘Even this close, there’s no response from the basecamp. Will keep trying.’ ‘Rotate frequencies,’ Augusta said. ‘Try every Imperial channel.’ ‘Trying all Imperial and all known Mechanicus frequencies, Sister. There’s no response.’ Akemi dropped her fetish and leaned over to pick it up. In the faint, green light, her small face was etched with worry. Viola’s fingers traced the carvings and the purity seals on the Godwyn-pattern heavy bolter. Aware of their tension, Augusta still watched the screen. The absence of the townspeople was a significant shift in their mission parameters – and removed almost all possibility that Felicity’s silence had been caused by some errant storm. It also meant that the townspeople could offer them neither information nor supplies. The Arvus was slowing still further now, dropping below the canopy; it smashed through the jungle, dense and green. Brackish, noxious waters reflected the vehicle’s belly-lights, and the pitted, dark stone of the town’s outer walls grew closer. Akemi’s gaze flicked back and forth, reading the scrolling data. Melia’s hand touched her fleur-de-lys, while Caia fiddled with the sight on her bolter, clicking and unclicking it, again and again. In the metal walls of the shuttle, the noise was oddly loud. The shipmaster’s voice said, ‘Do you wish to return to the Sorex, Sisters?’ ‘We do not,’ Augusta said. ‘Our mission is very clear. Take us to the landing point, shipmaster, and drop the hatch. Once our gear is unloaded, I want you out of here. Upon your return to the Sorex, please upload what we have found so far. We do not know what waits for us, but I wish the canoness to be aware of the situation.’ She didn’t need to add: In case we cannot make that communication ourselves. ‘Yes, Sister,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Landing point ETA, two minutes.’ The screen became murkier as the vessel passed into the treeline. The cargo bay seemed suddenly very dark. Caia’s clicking stopped. In the faint, greenish light, Augusta looked at her squad. ‘Very well.’ She was alert now, her mind sharp and working – they were in the field, and this was no time for doubt or hesitation. ‘Listen to me. When that hatch comes down, Viola, out and on point. Caia, Melia, you’ll take back up. Jatoya, Akemi, with me – we’ll need to unload our gear and let this shuttle get back into the air. It’s vulnerable, and I need it safely away.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘And once we’re down, our first priority is to secure the basecamp. Jatoya, take Viola, Caia and Melia. Do a full sweep and establish the perimeter. Akemi, with me – I’ll need you to access the camp’s records.’ She glanced at the young woman, her black hair shining. ‘You read machine dialect, yes?’ ‘A little, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘My training was very basic.’ ‘Good enough. See if you can get into Jencir’s records as well as Felicity’s.’ Augusta’s smile was grim, humourless. ‘You never know what you might find.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘I’ll take the field emitters and the gun emplacements, make sure everything is rearmed and fully operational. And once we’re secure, we’re going into that town.’ She was still watching the scan, watching the rising blur of stone that was the ziggurat, now looming close. ‘From this point, Sisters, we assume that Felicity’s squad has passed into the Emperor’s blessing, that the area is hostile, and that this is a full combat mission.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ They saluted her, fists to chestplates. ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘And may His light be with us all.’ Akemi dropped her fetish back into her vambrace. She picked up her helm, dropped it over her head, and twisted the seal closed. ‘Approaching the landing point,’ the shipmaster said. ‘Dropping speed-flaps now. Thirty seconds.’ Augusta could feel the vessel lowering, slowing to a hover. Her ears popped, and she lifted her own helm and snapped it into place. She flicked off the safety on her bolter, checked its ammo for the fourth time, and laid her other hand on her chainsword. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The alarm on the rear hatch started to blare. The lock released with an audible clunk. Hydraulics whined. Like uncoiling ribbons, light and steam stole down into the cargo-bay. Viola was already on her feet, heavy bolter in both hands. To Augusta, she looked like she wanted to fight. The Arvus hovered, jet engines thundering. The air reeked of promethium fuel and shimmered with oily heat. Bright belly lights showed the landing area – an open surface of cracked, dark stone that bordered the town on one side. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Under the engines’ noise, the words of the Litany of Battle flowed, steadying them. Line and verse wove from one voice to the next over the vox – where one Sister paused, another would take up the words, and the prayer rolled through and around them all, reminding them that this was His work, that they were here in His name. Here, upon Lautis. Again. Perhaps, Augusta thought, they were hoping that Felicity would hear them. The shuttle door lowered more fully, and the thick mist of the jungle flooded the back of the vehicle. Looking out at the swamp, the Sister Superior felt a pang of unease. She came to the side of the ramp to see more clearly, and saw that the rock of the landing area was speckled with green. There was only a tiny amount, but gentle, curling fronds of jungle vegetation had crept between the slabs, up through the various cracks. Small, perhaps, but with enough time, they could shatter the rock asunder. Obsessive to a fault, no tech-priest would permit such carelessness – no one had been out here in weeks. The lowering hatch thunked to a stop. Viola was already moving, boots crashing down the ramp, heavy bolter to her shoulder. She jumped from the ramp’s edge, landing in a combat kneel and moving her weapon in steady arcs. The heat of jet and jungle would confuse the preysight in her helmet, but Viola had the vehicle at her back and a clear field of fire – if anything moved, she’d see it. Nothing moved. Caia and Melia followed at a low run, dropping from the edge of the ramp. They crouched to offer Viola cover as she dashed forwards again. The Sisters’ skirmish-deployment was perfect, a smoothly functioning combat-machine. Their voices came back over the vox, now together, united in a quiet, steady chant of the hymnal – not the harmonised rage of full-on warfare, but the calm, clear caution of routine scouting. The still-firing engines drowned other noises out. The Arvus dangled in place, three inches above the stone ground, waiting. ‘Jatoya!’ Shouting to make herself heard, the Sister Superior instructed Jatoya to take the position at the ramp’s foot, flamer covering the approach. Then she gestured for Akemi to give her a hand with the gear. One by one, the two women threw the heavy cases out of the back of the shuttle. Silently cursing the absence of loaders, Augusta kept her bolter and chainsword holstered, and gestured to the side of the landing area, where the walls of the township could be clearly seen. ‘Over there! Stack it by the watchpost!’ The cathedral, further back and on the other side of the town, had faded to a shadowy blur, drowned in the planet’s noxious mist and the colossal overgrowth of flora. ‘Viola! Advance and secure the basecamp area! Caia, Melia, with Viola. Jatoya, Akemi, with me! Let’s get out of here!’ Breathless from the heat, ducking the noise of the Arvus and its hot convection winds, the Sisters picked up their gear and ran for the camp. Once they were clear, the shuttle lifted to the top of the canopy, its lights bright. It hovered there a moment, almost as if it were waiting for something, then it turned, and was swallowed by the trees.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR Sister Akemi crouched at the corner of a dark and moss-grown wall, her heart pounding. The wall was basalt, and carved in lines and patterns that still glowed faintly, as if with a biolume all of their own. Five paces ahead of Akemi’s position, Sister Viola crouched with the heavy bolter covering the roadway. Her armour glistened scarlet with condensing mist. Behind Viola’s shoulder, Sister Caia had her bolt pistol in one hand, and her auspex in the other. ‘The shipmaster was right,’ Caia said, over the vox. ‘There’s nothing out here.’ Akemi had read the reports, and she knew what the Sisters had been expecting. There should have been people here – hunters, foragers, crafters, builders. There should have been farmers, and the strange, pot-bellied livestock they called ‘paru’. There should have been soldiers, coming to welcome them, or to warn them away. There should have been the local priest, the leader of her people. But there was nothing. With its eerie, patterned gleam stretching outwards into the swamp-mist, the entire town looked empty. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The words of the hymnal were warming, familiar. …Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Be sure.’ Augusta’s tone was calm. ‘I’m sure, Sister,’ Caia told her. ‘There’s nothing moving, not so much as a beetle.’ ‘Very well,’ the Sister Superior said. ‘We remain in skirmish formation and proceed into the town. Viola, on point. Caia, on scan. Be alert, we cannot miss anything.’ ‘Aye.’ Viola moved forwards five paces, then crouched, again, to cover the roadway. Behind them, they’d found the basecamp empty. Allaying some of the squad’s initial fears, the fusion reactor and chemical batteries had been untouched; the interior lumens had shown pods and corridors in all their reinforced plasteel glory. Akemi had not known what to expect, and she’d found it oddly severe, carving its place out of the jungle with electro-fences and gun-emplacements, all still fully operational. The field emitters had even kept the flora at bay. Jencir, Augusta had commented, had extended the original camp – enlarged the area to accommodate his servitors, and the equipment he would need. But Jencir had gone. The servitors had gone. Felicity and their Sisters had all gone. The tiny chapel had been deserted, the pods echoing empty. The food in the storage units had been rotting in the heat, the water purifier all congealed with a thick, local moss. Even the tech-priest’s little brass cogitator had been left all alone, standing in his workshop with its metal beginning to corrode. While the squad had moved to secure the area, Akemi had studied the thing, trying to understand Jencir’s precisely noted analysis. But even from the tech-priest, there had been nothing – the reconnaissance of the cathedral had commenced on schedule, and the parts of his records that she could read had been chemical compositions, structural assessments, and endless, endless lists. She had tried to read more, struggling with the mist-rotted printouts, and she’d listened to Augusta’s attempts to make contact over the vox, listened to the bristle of static that was her only answer. The basecamp had been deserted. And now, the town was exactly the same. What had happened to the people? From the scourge of the Kraken… Suddenly, the silence seemed huge, and full of waiting. Her flesh crawling, Akemi fine-tuned her preysight. She wanted to see down the misted streets; she scanned the doorways and the windows and the tops of the walls. Surely there must be people still here somewhere, out in the farmlands, or standing by the odd, obelisk-shaped fountains and collecting the water that flowed down their sides? But even the water was stilled now, choked by the moss. The mist seethed, mocking, and she shuddered. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta said, ‘Keep moving.’ ‘Aye.’ Following Viola and Caia, Akemi ran to the next point and crouched again. This time, she’d ducked down beside a square, open-fronted stone building. Outside, a stylised figure, familiar armour crudely depicted, stood with its arms outstretched. Against it leaned a dozen electro-spears, their points ­scattered with rust, and glinting with moisture. From behind Akemi, Melia breathed, ‘Where did those come from?’ ‘Jencir, I would think – or Lyconides. A gift for the town.’ Augusta picked one up and thumbed the switch. The weapon fizzled and died. She put it back against its stone support, and said, ‘But I do not understand why the weapons are abandoned. If the people have left, then why are these still here?’ ‘Cross the jungle unarmed?’ Jatoya commented, from the back of the line. ‘Unwise, even without the orks.’ ‘Perhaps they’re all dead,’ Viola commented. ‘Then where are the bodies?’ Caia’s answer was bleak. ‘I dislike this.’ Even the Sister Superior sounded tense. ‘I want every building checked, every road, every corner.’ There was something in her tone that made Akemi’s fear rise again – Augusta usually seemed so indomitable. ‘Whatever’s happened here, we need to know, and we need this location secure before we move on to the cathedral. I’m not leaving our backs open.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved on. The hymnal was a breath now, almost subvocal as the squad listened to the silence of the town. From the blasphemy of the fallen… Another zig-zag crossroads, another fountain. The ancient stone patterns gleamed in green, all blurred by the mist. But nowhere was there movement. Not a bird cawed as it fled their advance; not a beetle scuttled as it escaped their boots. Even the surrounding jungle was utterly silent, as if the festooned loom of the trees was as bereft of life as everything else. Despite the environmental protections of her armour, Akemi was beginning to perspire. She had a sense of darkness and pressure, of rising claustrophobia; she felt like her helm had been broached, somehow, like she was inhaling the sweltering closeness of the atmosphere, the tightness of the sweat-thick air. …Our Emperor, deliver us. But none of the internal breach-warnings had been triggered, and sternly she told herself to breathe more deeply. Slowly, the moss grew thicker. It clustered in the corners of the walls and blotched the roadway like an infection. Desolation stretched out around them, endless and soundless. Side-road after side-road showed nothing – only the patterned lines in the dark stone. From the begetting of daemons… They crept onwards, even more slowly now, watching in every direction. The hymnal faded to almost a thrum, a steady rhythm that offered strength and faith, and the town gradually opened out into a sequence of wider, more regular crossings, many of them offering odd, metallic sculptures at their centres. These were huge and angled, impossible creations that rose high above the buildings and that defied Akemi’s comprehension. Jencir had recorded these, his drawings exquisite and exact – but she had not understood his extrapolations. Now, the moss had covered and blurred the metal. Thick and dark and rust-red, it clung to the sculptures, and to the stone, and to the fountainsides. It choked the waterflow, and it suffocated the flowers in the untended gardens. It swelled from the windows as if the very buildings were clogging from the inside. Surely, there had not been time for the moss to grow that thickly? Even the air felt thick, infecting their very breathing. Akemi could almost feel it, growing in her lungs. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta, however, showed little interest in the metalworks – she had seen them before. Instead, she gave the gesture for the squad to move on. Again and again, Akemi saw Viola kneel and watch, saw Caia pause to use the auspex, straining to find something – anything – some ghost of motion, some hint of life. And every time, she responded in the negative, and she and Viola ran on. ‘Where are they all?’ Melia asked, her words soft with horror. ‘Where did they go?’ Like Felicity, the entire population of the town had simply… …vanished. Akemi shuddered, sweat still sliding over her skin. She remembered running the gantries of the Sorex, the endless, repetitive drills. They’d been training missions to make her combat-responses reflexive, she knew that – but out here, the safety of the clattering metal walkways seemed very far away. ‘I feel like something’s watching me,’ Melia went on. ‘Or like something’s growing–’ ‘We walk in His light,’ Augusta said, her voice like steel. ‘With me, Sisters. From the curse of the mutant…’ ‘…Our Emperor, deliver us.’ Slowly, the buildings grew taller, more decorous. As they turned, at last, into a wide and ornate plaza, Akemi paused, surprised. More of the metal sculptures loomed here, brass and rust and steel – and these were even larger, stretching upwards into the mist. There was a circle of them, like twisted dancers, all fathomless and extreme. And they looked… wrong, somehow, their angles distorted, their struts and cogs and pipes a mystery and all covered in rot. With an odd flicker, Akemi understood that the other sculptures, the smaller ones, had all been part of the same construction and shape. Pieces of the same thing, perhaps? Jencir had drawn this one also, his recreation meticulous. ‘Wait. Sisters, wait!’ Augusta paused. As the Sister Superior nodded, Akemi moved to study the closest, to walk around it until she found what she was looking for… Writing. She blinked. Jencir had drawn this too, and the symbols were unknown to her. They seemed to writhe across the metal rather than being engraved within it. For a moment, the fear in her throat almost threatened to choke her. ‘What does it say?’ Caia asked her, auspex still in hand. The scanner was flickering, and its green light played on the sculpture’s metal. ‘I cannot read this, Sister,’ Akemi said, apologising. ‘It is not a language I comprehend.’ ‘Is this not machine dialect?’ Augusta asked, surprised. ‘We had concluded that these came from Mars, from the Ring of Iron. As the town and the ziggurat were first built by the Great Crusade, so the machines of the Mechanicus…’ Her voice faltered, and it was enough to bring Akemi out in a fresh sweat. Seeking reassurance, she said, ‘Sister, Jencir showed much interest in these… creations. They captivated him. But if this is – was – a machine, then its spirit is long, long dead.’ A ghost seemed to pass across all of them – a shiver of something other, something beyond their experience or comprehension. Melia was nervous, restlessly checking the empty roads; Caia was studying the auspex, as if puzzled by its behaviour. ‘What did his notes say?’ Augusta asked Akemi. ‘Exactly?’ ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I could not read his records very well.’ She had an urge to reach for her fetish, dismissed it. ‘He speculated a twenty-nine-point-eight per cent possibility that the machinery had been for ­mining, a thirty-four-point-two per cent possibility that its purpose had been construction. Those percentages… are not very high.’ The notes had gone into painstaking and unreadable detail, but Akemi paused as Augusta commented, ‘Then what would be the purpose of such devices?’ ‘I do not know,’ Akemi said. She offered her ignorance hesitantly, as if she expected a reprimand. But Augusta tapped a boot, thinking. ‘Did he offer speculation? A source – or purpose?’ ‘No, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Not that I could read.’ Restless, Viola kicked at a stone and sent it scuttling across the plaza. ‘Desist.’ Augusta snapped the order at the impatient younger Sister, and turned back to the metalwork. She considered it for a moment longer, then moved as if she’d made a decision. ‘Thank you, Sister Akemi. We will keep this information for the future. For now, we cannot make use of it. Jatoya, hold this point. Akemi, with me. There’s something else here that I need to check.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya commanded the squad to a compass defence, watching every approach; Augusta directed Akemi to the building beside the sculpture. It was the largest one they’d seen, the patterns on its walls more elaborate than the rest, and it was almost smothered in the thick, rusty lichen, creeping from its insides like decay. Her blood thumping, her mind still reciting the words of the litany, Akemi moved to the door. And stopped, her heart suddenly in her mouth. ‘Throne!’ Her exclamation was involuntary, and she knew Augusta was behind her, and she knew the drills. Controlling her initial shock, she dropped to one knee, her bolter covering the mess. Augusta swore, her words vicious enough to almost make Akemi blush. This building had a much larger living space, a room big enough to accommodate a group – maybe a town meeting or council. Its interior walls were carved in incredible patterns, and they lit its inside to a thick, green light. Behind her, Augusta’s voice was grim. ‘So, there was fighting here after all.’ In the living space, there were signs of a struggle. The furniture had been smashed and scattered, the rugs torn from the doorways. Augusta’s chainsword, still silent, pointed past Akemi’s shoulder, and the younger woman looked down. The floor-rug was shredded, as if by frantically scrabbling hands. Pieces of bright fabric were scattered across the black stone, alongside what looked like a familiar votive candle. But they were not what Augusta had indicated. Beside the rug’s remains, there was a long, rough smear, harder to see against the rock. But it looked like something – or someone – had been dragged from the building. Dragged, and fighting all the way. Following the line of the marks, Akemi found herself looking at a stain on the bottom corner of the doorway, right by her foot. One that looked very much like fingers, grasping at a forlorn and final hope. ‘Kawa Koumu lived here.’ Augusta named the priest who had governed her people, who had fought the orks as best she could, and who had welcomed the Sisters as protectors. ‘She was a good woman, strong in her faith.’ The Sister Superior stepped past Akemi and into the room, her armoured shoulders rigid with anger, and with tight, personal control. She picked up the candle and put it in its niche on the wall. ‘Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Whatever took her, it took her out towards the ziggurat.’ She used the muzzle of her weapon to gesture at the lines on the floor, how they curved when they passed the doorway. ‘She did not go willingly.’ ‘I doubt she would have,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak. ‘But why the priest?’ Akemi asked her. ‘This is the only place we’ve seen fighting. Why would she, alone, offer resistance?’ Augusta had crouched and was inspecting the stains. From behind them, Jatoya’s rejoinder was dark. ‘Perhaps because she was the only one that could.’ Akemi caught her breath, stopped herself from cursing. Gesturing for Akemi to remain in the doorway, Augusta moved carefully through the debris, shifting it with the end of her chainsword. But though they searched every corner, there was nothing else to find. They left Kawa’s home, and turned at last into the centre of the town. Here, close and looming, stood the ziggurat. It was huge and stern, its dark flanks stepped, its head and shoulders rising high above the levels of roofs and trees. The mist curled round its sides, making the stone gleam with moisture; carved warriors decorated its sides and two armoured figures stood like twin guards at the foot of its long flight of steps. And, at its peak, a lone figure waited, His chin lifted, His head haloed in light-rays. Akemi paused. The others may have seen this before, but this ancient depiction of the God-Emperor was new to her, and wondrous. She touched one gauntlet to the front of her armour and bowed her head. But the ziggurat, too, was blotched in moss. Viola muttered, her tones vicious. Here, the stains seemed a travesty, a confrontation – and the sight of them prickled the hairs on Akemi’s neck. And it wasn’t just at the moss, not just its blasphemous invasion of the stone; it was the creeping, suffocating anxiety that had been with them from the moment they’d left the Arvus. As Melia had said, it felt like they were being watched, like there was something lurking in one of the moss-splotched buildings, or in the surrounding streets. It was something dark, something inhuman, something hidden in the hot mist. Something that had all of them in its sights. But they had, at least, found the population of the town. Under the ziggurat, there lay bodies. At first, Akemi didn’t realise what she was seeing – the people lay in a wide half-circle, almost as if they were sky-gazing. Foolishly, she thought at first that they were unwell, and that she was seeing some sort of outdoor valetudinarium. And then she realised that the faint blur to her vision was not the smear of heat in her preysight. It was the flies. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ The curse was Melia, quiet with shock. ‘Sister?’ Augusta’s bark was subdued. Melia said, ‘They’re all dead. Have been for some time.’ She sounded shaken. ‘Whatever killed them must have laid them out like this. Done it deliberately.’ Akemi knew what would happen to a corpse, left outside and in this heat. She paused, her fear clamouring at her; she raised her eyes to the ancient God-Emperor as if asking Him for help. ‘Viola,’ Augusta said. ‘Follow the outside of the plaza until we get full visibility. If something has left this here intentionally, it could well be an ambush.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Akemi!’ Augusta’s bark was sharp in her vox-bead. ‘Move!’ Akemi jumped, did as she was ordered. They moved onwards, more cautiously now, circling the bodies and the lined grey-green of the plaza itself. It seemed almost that the blood-rust moss had started from here, had flowed outwards from the ziggurat’s foot and had spread like corrosion through the deserted streets. And then, Akemi saw something else. Every single one of the dead townspeople had been… ‘Where are their heads?’ Viola voiced her exact thought. Akemi faltered, stopped. The moss was in her lungs and she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t… A morte perpetua… ‘That’s not the only problem,’ Caia said. ‘Sisters, the plinth…’ ‘Hold this location.’ Augusta’s command was almost unnecessary; the Sisters had halted in a combat half-wheel, their backs to the nearest wall. They bristled bolters in every direction, waiting for that lurking foe, for that darkness that had stalked them through the town. …Domine, libra nos. Akemi, holding to the litany like she’d held to her little fetish, looked over at the single basalt plinth that occupied the centre of the plaza, and the foot of the ziggurat’s steps. A single figure lay upon it. It was arched backwards, chest thrown out, as if it still struggled, but it had been dead for many days. Its flesh had bloated and blackened, and it had started to decay. The flies hovered over it, fat and lazy. Its head, too, was gone. Its ribcage had been cracked open and parted like doors; its internal organs were ­liquefying in the heat. Black stains covered its robes and had spread down the sides of the plinth – black stains that now swelled with the thick, rust-red moss. She caught the stench and gagged. ‘Kawa,’ Augusta said, the word a breath, grieving. The Sister Superior dropped to one knee, touched one hand to the front of her armour. ‘Fighting to the last. Walk in His light, my friend.’ The Sisters repeated, ‘Walk in His light.’ Stretched out in some barbarous and heretical sacrifice, the town priest had lost her battle against whatever had dragged her from her home. Beneath the ziggurat, beneath the ancient stone gaze of the Emperor Himself, she had been executed – and in some vile act of mockery, in some rite of blood-worship that Akemi could not understand. But she made herself look, think. Kawa’s wrists and ankles showed no signs of restraints. It suggested that she had been rendered incapable of fighting, or that something – somethings – had been holding her down. And around her, her people lay headless, their blood staining the stone. Augusta said, ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, that Thou shouldst spare none…’ Reciting the litany, her chant grew in tension, and her voice trilled with tightly controlled fury. Akemi knew the squad’s history – the priest had been their friend and supporter, had welcomed them, as she’d welcomed Sister Felicity. ‘…That Thou shouldst pardon none, we beseech Thee, destroy them.’ The squad answered her. Viola’s voice seethed as she shaped the words. Jatoya’s deep tones were soaked in a low throb of pure wrath. Augusta looked up at the ziggurat as though she made her promise to the Emperor Himself. ‘Whatever did this, we will find it. ‘And we will be its ending.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR Sister Akemi crouched at the corner of a dark and moss-grown wall, her heart pounding. The wall was basalt, and carved in lines and patterns that still glowed faintly, as if with a biolume all of their own. Five paces ahead of Akemi’s position, Sister Viola crouched with the heavy bolter covering the roadway. Her armour glistened scarlet with condensing mist. Behind Viola’s shoulder, Sister Caia had her bolt pistol in one hand, and her auspex in the other. ‘The shipmaster was right,’ Caia said, over the vox. ‘There’s nothing out here.’ Akemi had read the reports, and she knew what the Sisters had been expecting. There should have been people here – hunters, foragers, crafters, builders. There should have been farmers, and the strange, pot-bellied livestock they called ‘paru’. There should have been soldiers, coming to welcome them, or to warn them away. There should have been the local priest, the leader of her people. But there was nothing. With its eerie, patterned gleam stretching outwards into the swamp-mist, the entire town looked empty. From plague, deceit, temptation and war… The words of the hymnal were warming, familiar. …Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Be sure.’ Augusta’s tone was calm. ‘I’m sure, Sister,’ Caia told her. ‘There’s nothing moving, not so much as a beetle.’ ‘Very well,’ the Sister Superior said. ‘We remain in skirmish formation and proceed into the town. Viola, on point. Caia, on scan. Be alert, we cannot miss anything.’ ‘Aye.’ Viola moved forwards five paces, then crouched, again, to cover the roadway. Behind them, they’d found the basecamp empty. Allaying some of the squad’s initial fears, the fusion reactor and chemical batteries had been untouched; the interior lumens had shown pods and corridors in all their reinforced plasteel glory. Akemi had not known what to expect, and she’d found it oddly severe, carving its place out of the jungle with electro-fences and gun-emplacements, all still fully operational. The field emitters had even kept the flora at bay. Jencir, Augusta had commented, had extended the original camp – enlarged the area to accommodate his servitors, and the equipment he would need. But Jencir had gone. The servitors had gone. Felicity and their Sisters had all gone. The tiny chapel had been deserted, the pods echoing empty. The food in the storage units had been rotting in the heat, the water purifier all congealed with a thick, local moss. Even the tech-priest’s little brass cogitator had been left all alone, standing in his workshop with its metal beginning to corrode. While the squad had moved to secure the area, Akemi had studied the thing, trying to understand Jencir’s precisely noted analysis. But even from the tech-priest, there had been nothing – the reconnaissance of the cathedral had commenced on schedule, and the parts of his records that she could read had been chemical compositions, structural assessments, and endless, endless lists. She had tried to read more, struggling with the mist-rotted printouts, and she’d listened to Augusta’s attempts to make contact over the vox, listened to the bristle of static that was her only answer. The basecamp had been deserted. And now, the town was exactly the same. What had happened to the people? From the scourge of the Kraken… Suddenly, the silence seemed huge, and full of waiting. Her flesh crawling, Akemi fine-tuned her preysight. She wanted to see down the misted streets; she scanned the doorways and the windows and the tops of the walls. Surely there must be people still here somewhere, out in the farmlands, or standing by the odd, obelisk-shaped fountains and collecting the water that flowed down their sides? But even the water was stilled now, choked by the moss. The mist seethed, mocking, and she shuddered. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta said, ‘Keep moving.’ ‘Aye.’ Following Viola and Caia, Akemi ran to the next point and crouched again. This time, she’d ducked down beside a square, open-fronted stone building. Outside, a stylised figure, familiar armour crudely depicted, stood with its arms outstretched. Against it leaned a dozen electro-spears, their points ­scattered with rust, and glinting with moisture. From behind Akemi, Melia breathed, ‘Where did those come from?’ ‘Jencir, I would think – or Lyconides. A gift for the town.’ Augusta picked one up and thumbed the switch. The weapon fizzled and died. She put it back against its stone support, and said, ‘But I do not understand why the weapons are abandoned. If the people have left, then why are these still here?’ ‘Cross the jungle unarmed?’ Jatoya commented, from the back of the line. ‘Unwise, even without the orks.’ ‘Perhaps they’re all dead,’ Viola commented. ‘Then where are the bodies?’ Caia’s answer was bleak. ‘I dislike this.’ Even the Sister Superior sounded tense. ‘I want every building checked, every road, every corner.’ There was something in her tone that made Akemi’s fear rise again – Augusta usually seemed so indomitable. ‘Whatever’s happened here, we need to know, and we need this location secure before we move on to the cathedral. I’m not leaving our backs open.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved on. The hymnal was a breath now, almost subvocal as the squad listened to the silence of the town. From the blasphemy of the fallen… Another zig-zag crossroads, another fountain. The ancient stone patterns gleamed in green, all blurred by the mist. But nowhere was there movement. Not a bird cawed as it fled their advance; not a beetle scuttled as it escaped their boots. Even the surrounding jungle was utterly silent, as if the festooned loom of the trees was as bereft of life as everything else. Despite the environmental protections of her armour, Akemi was beginning to perspire. She had a sense of darkness and pressure, of rising claustrophobia; she felt like her helm had been broached, somehow, like she was inhaling the sweltering closeness of the atmosphere, the tightness of the sweat-thick air. …Our Emperor, deliver us. But none of the internal breach-warnings had been triggered, and sternly she told herself to breathe more deeply. Slowly, the moss grew thicker. It clustered in the corners of the walls and blotched the roadway like an infection. Desolation stretched out around them, endless and soundless. Side-road after side-road showed nothing – only the patterned lines in the dark stone. From the begetting of daemons… They crept onwards, even more slowly now, watching in every direction. The hymnal faded to almost a thrum, a steady rhythm that offered strength and faith, and the town gradually opened out into a sequence of wider, more regular crossings, many of them offering odd, metallic sculptures at their centres. These were huge and angled, impossible creations that rose high above the buildings and that defied Akemi’s comprehension. Jencir had recorded these, his drawings exquisite and exact – but she had not understood his extrapolations. Now, the moss had covered and blurred the metal. Thick and dark and rust-red, it clung to the sculptures, and to the stone, and to the fountainsides. It choked the waterflow, and it suffocated the flowers in the untended gardens. It swelled from the windows as if the very buildings were clogging from the inside. Surely, there had not been time for the moss to grow that thickly? Even the air felt thick, infecting their very breathing. Akemi could almost feel it, growing in her lungs. …Our Emperor, deliver us. Augusta, however, showed little interest in the metalworks – she had seen them before. Instead, she gave the gesture for the squad to move on. Again and again, Akemi saw Viola kneel and watch, saw Caia pause to use the auspex, straining to find something – anything – some ghost of motion, some hint of life. And every time, she responded in the negative, and she and Viola ran on. ‘Where are they all?’ Melia asked, her words soft with horror. ‘Where did they go?’ Like Felicity, the entire population of the town had simply… …vanished. Akemi shuddered, sweat still sliding over her skin. She remembered running the gantries of the Sorex, the endless, repetitive drills. They’d been training missions to make her combat-responses reflexive, she knew that – but out here, the safety of the clattering metal walkways seemed very far away. ‘I feel like something’s watching me,’ Melia went on. ‘Or like something’s growing–’ ‘We walk in His light,’ Augusta said, her voice like steel. ‘With me, Sisters. From the curse of the mutant…’ ‘…Our Emperor, deliver us.’ Slowly, the buildings grew taller, more decorous. As they turned, at last, into a wide and ornate plaza, Akemi paused, surprised. More of the metal sculptures loomed here, brass and rust and steel – and these were even larger, stretching upwards into the mist. There was a circle of them, like twisted dancers, all fathomless and extreme. And they looked… wrong, somehow, their angles distorted, their struts and cogs and pipes a mystery and all covered in rot. With an odd flicker, Akemi understood that the other sculptures, the smaller ones, had all been part of the same construction and shape. Pieces of the same thing, perhaps? Jencir had drawn this one also, his recreation meticulous. ‘Wait. Sisters, wait!’ Augusta paused. As the Sister Superior nodded, Akemi moved to study the closest, to walk around it until she found what she was looking for… Writing. She blinked. Jencir had drawn this too, and the symbols were unknown to her. They seemed to writhe across the metal rather than being engraved within it. For a moment, the fear in her throat almost threatened to choke her. ‘What does it say?’ Caia asked her, auspex still in hand. The scanner was flickering, and its green light played on the sculpture’s metal. ‘I cannot read this, Sister,’ Akemi said, apologising. ‘It is not a language I comprehend.’ ‘Is this not machine dialect?’ Augusta asked, surprised. ‘We had concluded that these came from Mars, from the Ring of Iron. As the town and the ziggurat were first built by the Great Crusade, so the machines of the Mechanicus…’ Her voice faltered, and it was enough to bring Akemi out in a fresh sweat. Seeking reassurance, she said, ‘Sister, Jencir showed much interest in these… creations. They captivated him. But if this is – was – a machine, then its spirit is long, long dead.’ A ghost seemed to pass across all of them – a shiver of something other, something beyond their experience or comprehension. Melia was nervous, restlessly checking the empty roads; Caia was studying the auspex, as if puzzled by its behaviour. ‘What did his notes say?’ Augusta asked Akemi. ‘Exactly?’ ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I could not read his records very well.’ She had an urge to reach for her fetish, dismissed it. ‘He speculated a twenty-nine-point-eight per cent possibility that the machinery had been for ­mining, a thirty-four-point-two per cent possibility that its purpose had been construction. Those percentages… are not very high.’ The notes had gone into painstaking and unreadable detail, but Akemi paused as Augusta commented, ‘Then what would be the purpose of such devices?’ ‘I do not know,’ Akemi said. She offered her ignorance hesitantly, as if she expected a reprimand. But Augusta tapped a boot, thinking. ‘Did he offer speculation? A source – or purpose?’ ‘No, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Not that I could read.’ Restless, Viola kicked at a stone and sent it scuttling across the plaza. ‘Desist.’ Augusta snapped the order at the impatient younger Sister, and turned back to the metalwork. She considered it for a moment longer, then moved as if she’d made a decision. ‘Thank you, Sister Akemi. We will keep this information for the future. For now, we cannot make use of it. Jatoya, hold this point. Akemi, with me. There’s something else here that I need to check.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya commanded the squad to a compass defence, watching every approach; Augusta directed Akemi to the building beside the sculpture. It was the largest one they’d seen, the patterns on its walls more elaborate than the rest, and it was almost smothered in the thick, rusty lichen, creeping from its insides like decay. Her blood thumping, her mind still reciting the words of the litany, Akemi moved to the door. And stopped, her heart suddenly in her mouth. ‘Throne!’ Her exclamation was involuntary, and she knew Augusta was behind her, and she knew the drills. Controlling her initial shock, she dropped to one knee, her bolter covering the mess. Augusta swore, her words vicious enough to almost make Akemi blush. This building had a much larger living space, a room big enough to accommodate a group – maybe a town meeting or council. Its interior walls were carved in incredible patterns, and they lit its inside to a thick, green light. Behind her, Augusta’s voice was grim. ‘So, there was fighting here after all.’ In the living space, there were signs of a struggle. The furniture had been smashed and scattered, the rugs torn from the doorways. Augusta’s chainsword, still silent, pointed past Akemi’s shoulder, and the younger woman looked down. The floor-rug was shredded, as if by frantically scrabbling hands. Pieces of bright fabric were scattered across the black stone, alongside what looked like a familiar votive candle. But they were not what Augusta had indicated. Beside the rug’s remains, there was a long, rough smear, harder to see against the rock. But it looked like something – or someone – had been dragged from the building. Dragged, and fighting all the way. Following the line of the marks, Akemi found herself looking at a stain on the bottom corner of the doorway, right by her foot. One that looked very much like fingers, grasping at a forlorn and final hope. ‘Kawa Koumu lived here.’ Augusta named the priest who had governed her people, who had fought the orks as best she could, and who had welcomed the Sisters as protectors. ‘She was a good woman, strong in her faith.’ The Sister Superior stepped past Akemi and into the room, her armoured shoulders rigid with anger, and with tight, personal control. She picked up the candle and put it in its niche on the wall. ‘Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Whatever took her, it took her out towards the ziggurat.’ She used the muzzle of her weapon to gesture at the lines on the floor, how they curved when they passed the doorway. ‘She did not go willingly.’ ‘I doubt she would have,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak. ‘But why the priest?’ Akemi asked her. ‘This is the only place we’ve seen fighting. Why would she, alone, offer resistance?’ Augusta had crouched and was inspecting the stains. From behind them, Jatoya’s rejoinder was dark. ‘Perhaps because she was the only one that could.’ Akemi caught her breath, stopped herself from cursing. Gesturing for Akemi to remain in the doorway, Augusta moved carefully through the debris, shifting it with the end of her chainsword. But though they searched every corner, there was nothing else to find. They left Kawa’s home, and turned at last into the centre of the town. Here, close and looming, stood the ziggurat. It was huge and stern, its dark flanks stepped, its head and shoulders rising high above the levels of roofs and trees. The mist curled round its sides, making the stone gleam with moisture; carved warriors decorated its sides and two armoured figures stood like twin guards at the foot of its long flight of steps. And, at its peak, a lone figure waited, His chin lifted, His head haloed in light-rays. Akemi paused. The others may have seen this before, but this ancient depiction of the God-Emperor was new to her, and wondrous. She touched one gauntlet to the front of her armour and bowed her head. But the ziggurat, too, was blotched in moss. Viola muttered, her tones vicious. Here, the stains seemed a travesty, a confrontation – and the sight of them prickled the hairs on Akemi’s neck. And it wasn’t just at the moss, not just its blasphemous invasion of the stone; it was the creeping, suffocating anxiety that had been with them from the moment they’d left the Arvus. As Melia had said, it felt like they were being watched, like there was something lurking in one of the moss-splotched buildings, or in the surrounding streets. It was something dark, something inhuman, something hidden in the hot mist. Something that had all of them in its sights. But they had, at least, found the population of the town. Under the ziggurat, there lay bodies. At first, Akemi didn’t realise what she was seeing – the people lay in a wide half-circle, almost as if they were sky-gazing. Foolishly, she thought at first that they were unwell, and that she was seeing some sort of outdoor valetudinarium. And then she realised that the faint blur to her vision was not the smear of heat in her preysight. It was the flies. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ The curse was Melia, quiet with shock. ‘Sister?’ Augusta’s bark was subdued. Melia said, ‘They’re all dead. Have been for some time.’ She sounded shaken. ‘Whatever killed them must have laid them out like this. Done it deliberately.’ Akemi knew what would happen to a corpse, left outside and in this heat. She paused, her fear clamouring at her; she raised her eyes to the ancient God-Emperor as if asking Him for help. ‘Viola,’ Augusta said. ‘Follow the outside of the plaza until we get full visibility. If something has left this here intentionally, it could well be an ambush.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Akemi!’ Augusta’s bark was sharp in her vox-bead. ‘Move!’ Akemi jumped, did as she was ordered. They moved onwards, more cautiously now, circling the bodies and the lined grey-green of the plaza itself. It seemed almost that the blood-rust moss had started from here, had flowed outwards from the ziggurat’s foot and had spread like corrosion through the deserted streets. And then, Akemi saw something else. Every single one of the dead townspeople had been… ‘Where are their heads?’ Viola voiced her exact thought. Akemi faltered, stopped. The moss was in her lungs and she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t… A morte perpetua… ‘That’s not the only problem,’ Caia said. ‘Sisters, the plinth…’ ‘Hold this location.’ Augusta’s command was almost unnecessary; the Sisters had halted in a combat half-wheel, their backs to the nearest wall. They bristled bolters in every direction, waiting for that lurking foe, for that darkness that had stalked them through the town. …Domine, libra nos. Akemi, holding to the litany like she’d held to her little fetish, looked over at the single basalt plinth that occupied the centre of the plaza, and the foot of the ziggurat’s steps. A single figure lay upon it. It was arched backwards, chest thrown out, as if it still struggled, but it had been dead for many days. Its flesh had bloated and blackened, and it had started to decay.

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Lautis cathedral was not as Augusta remembered it. Walking down the ruined aisle, the building hollow and roofless over her head, the Sister Superior let her boots ring from the stone. Kawa’s fate and the desecration of the town had left her tight with anger, and she walked bolter in hand, the weapon issuing an outright challenge to whatever was lurking here. With her, her squad walked in double-file. But they could not reach the steps. Unlike their previous visit, the nave was filled with rubble – tumbled pillars, collapsed walls, smashed pieces of fallen buttresses. Augusta knew the pattern of krak grenade debris all too well; she recognised the scars in the stonework where the ammunition of her Sisters had chewed chunks from the rock. She halted, Caia behind her, auspex in hand. ‘Full suppression bursts,’ Caia said. ‘Bolter and heavy bolter alike.’ She paused, studying the spreads of the scars. ‘They fought a retreating action, backwards, up the aisle.’ Turning slowly, studying the instrument in her hand, she pointed. ‘There!’ From beneath the rubble she saw a single, augmetic foot, grip-talons extended as if in some final act of rage or pain. Scatters of warm rain misted across the air. Augusta knelt, carefully moving the rocks. ‘Common construction servitor.’ The thing was smashed to a pulp, the flesh parts of its face rotting and the cogs in its skull all starting to corrode. ‘Melia?’ ‘Been dead longer than the townspeople.’ Melia dropped to one careful knee beside the Sister Superior and turned what was left of the head with a red-gauntleted hand. ‘Flesh doesn’t last in this climate – there’s nothing left but tools and circuitry.’ ‘Jatoya, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved more of the fallen stone. The heap groaned and shifted; scatters of dust and pebbles rolled down its sides. Slowly, they exposed more of the thing, its chest a disintegrating mess of cybernetic organs, its left arm ending in a heavy, stonecutter saw. Its right arm was completely missing. ‘It was fighting something.’ Melia tapped the dried stains on the sawblade. Augusta nodded. ‘They must have been surrounded, or overwhelmed.’ ‘But what could do this?’ Melia asked her. ‘What could move with this sort of swiftness? Overwhelm a squad of our Sisters and a contingent of fully-equipped construction servitors?’ ‘And was it the same thing that emptied the town?’ Augusta’s question was rhetorical; she was still moving the rubble, searching. ‘I do not yet comprehend this, Sisters, not this place and its mysteries, and not this foe. I fear that there are darker things here than orks.’ Melia said nothing. The other four had deployed to a compass defence, covering pillars and archways; Caia still moved her auspex in careful arcs. Augusta’s mention of the orks had returned the memory of their previous battle, and the squad had no intention of being caught a second time. The Sister Superior moved more of the pile. It shuddered and shifted, exposing a second, semi-human body, this one with its face all but missing. She looked down at it, gauging. Servitors could put up a hard and nasty fight – there were worse melee weapons than heavy construction tools. And, like Melia, she did not understand what could have overcome them so swiftly. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We scout by twos, roll call every ninety seconds. Melia, with me. This puzzle requires an answer.’ The squad deployed as it had done once before, spreading out to explore what was left of the transept and cloisters. Augusta kept Melia with her, needing the woman’s medical training – Melia was not a Hospitaller, but her field knowledge was excellent. What they found were pieces. The dismembered remains of the servitors were spread throughout the nave – almost as if some predator had gone on a hunting rampage and had scattered leftovers in its wake. Not one of the corpses remained intact: many of them were missing heads, or limbs, or tools, or tracks. Many more had been disembowelled and their internal organs spread out around them. Yet they found no sign of Jencir himself – and nothing to show what had happened to the Sisters. Melia picked up a servitor’s detached clamp-arm and turned it over. ‘This was bitten,’ she said. She held it out. ‘What can bite through plasteel?’ ‘Very big teeth,’ Augusta commented, taking the limb to examine it. Over the vox, Viola said, ‘There were gun-servitors in the east transept. There’s no sign of whatever took them down.’ ‘Which way are they facing?’ Augusta asked. ‘They’re a mess,’ Viola commented. ‘But my instincts say the attack came from the nave.’ ‘Understood,’ Augusta said. ‘Keep looking.’ ‘Aye.’ Picking their way past the fallen stonework, pieces of it as large as an immolator tank, Augusta and Melia reached the bottom of the steps. Electro-candles had been left here, one on each step climbing towards the altar, but they stood rusting and lightless, now – forgotten. But still, not a single flash of scarlet armour. Bitten. A suspicion was starting to grow in Augusta’s heart. Over the vox, Jatoya’s voice said, ‘West transept clear, proceeding into the cloisters. Looks like the repairs started as scheduled, Sister, there’s a full support framework out here, platforms and scaffolding.’ ‘What of the defences?’ ‘Gun-servitors here, too,’ Jatoya said. ‘Weapons are still half-loaded. Whatever took them down was fast.’ Augusta’s suspicion was solidifying with every word Jatoya said. She paused before the top step. The drop to her knee was as much a part of her faith as drawing breath, but this time, she stayed standing. And her hand tightened on her bolter as the anger surged in her soul. On the Emperor’s high altar, there sat a skull. Just the one. It was – or had been – human, but its plates and eyestalks and mechadendrites identified it easily. Jencir. It had been flayed of all skin and placed in the altar’s centre, exactly where the Holy Aquila should have been. To one side of it lay a rosarius. To the other, a single fleur-de-lys blade. All three items were stained with dried and flaking blood. It had been poured lavishly over them. It had streamed from Jencir’s eye sockets; it had covered the top of the altar, coated its sides and spread out across the stone like a stain. A flicker of sweat stole across Augusta’s skin – like an echo of a dark disquiet. I know this… Melia had stopped at her shoulder. Softly, the Sister Superior murmured a prayer – for the tech-priest, for the profaned altar. She spent a long moment looking, then she stepped onto the top step, the Holy of Holies. With a surge of anger and the slam of one armoured fist, she knocked the skull sideways. It clattered across the chancel and rolled to a stop. ‘Noli timere,’ she said. ‘Feruntur Lucem.’ The words were soft, aimed at the bloodstains, at the dark and eerie creeping in her skin. I do not fear you. I carry the Light. Carefully she picked up the blade and the rosarius and tucked them into her belt. Then she turned around and drew the chainsword with a rasp that echoed down through the nave. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘To me. We are played.’ Melia had put her back to the altar stone, was covering the approach with her bolter. ‘What do you mean?’ Augusta’s suspicions had become a certainty, cold and hard. ‘This was a gift,’ she said. ‘A taunt.’ She stood still, framed by the desecrated altar, by the empty window where the Emperor should have been, resplendent in glassiac and glory. ‘All of you, to me.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya’s tones were dangerous; Augusta could hear the squad moving, running for the steps. ‘I have faced this foe before,’ she told them. ‘Witnessed the depths of the horror it brings. It thirsts for blood, and for warfare. It haunts my dreams, and it wakes me in a cold sweat.’ The admission was a warning, not a weakness. ‘And it knows that other members of the Order must come, seeking their Sisters.’ She turned to look through the nave, searching. ‘It has been waiting for us.’ Then she snapped, ‘Like that!’ Unsurprised, she used the blade to point down the steps, indicating a curl of red flesh that crept around the base of a pillar. The motion was sinewy and horribly familiar. It brought a mouthful of anger and bile, echoes of images she could never forget. But her faith burned fiercely and she held herself still, her flickers of fear and fury absolutely controlled. She said, ‘What has teeth that could bite through plasteel?’ Melia cursed. ‘What in Dominica’s name is that? It looks like it’s been…’ ‘Skinned alive.’ She knew these things, these things that brought terror like a herald, like a rush of sickness to their hearts. ‘There.’ She pointed the blade again, at another one, a second slide of hot, red skin. ‘And there.’ And at another, around the pillar opposite. At a fourth, a fifth. Blade still in her hand, she raised her bolter, and began to recite the Litany of Mettle. ‘Et Tu quaeris tibi fortitudinem stare coram nobis…’ We stand before You and ask for Your strength… And more and more of them crept into her line of sight. Augusta knew exactly what the creatures were, had faced them before. On the industrial world of Hephaestus, down in the heart of the ash-choked mines, too much death had summoned them, and they had come. Come hunting. The things were quadrupedal and big; their spiked and sloping shoulders were the height of Augusta’s hip. They had long, yellow fangs, and eyes that burned with unholy light, bright as bloodlust and cruelty. Some had horns on their muzzles; others had back-ridges that spread like batwings. But every single one of them was as red as glistening gore, as red as a newly flayed victim, as red as the Sisters’ own armour. As they crept forwards, they stared, unblinking, at the women. ‘Flesh hounds,’ Augusta said. ‘Denizens of Ruin.’ She held the gaze of the lead beast and stared it down, confronting the fear, the memories. Her heart pounded as the litany trilled through the vox. ‘They can tear through flesh and bone and metal. Overwhelm servo-skulls and servitors alike.’ Beside her, Melia had bolter in hand, but her aim was trembling as she watched the things slink low across the floor. They moved like blood, like the rise of night, and the fear came off them in a wave. Augusta raised her bolter, but she did not fire, not yet. She watched. She watched as more and more of them came into view. They skulked behind the rubble-piles; they lurked in the half-light. Their eyes glowed with hellish colours, and steam rose from their backs. She felt like she was struggling to breathe, like there was a knot of tension in the top of her chest. ‘Single shots,’ she said. ‘Aim carefully and conserve your ammunition – there may be more. Hold steady, my Sisters. The fear is but an illusion, a trick of the dark. His light is with us.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia raised her bolter and shot a creature in the face. It shook its head and growled at her, teeth bared. Saliva sizzled as it hit the stone. At the sound, the others started to snarl, a low, bubbling rasp. It echoed throughout the ruin, rising in volume and fury. The air grew thicker still. Augusta’s grip tightened on blade and bolter both. Then she heard Jatoya, ‘A morte perpetua!’, saw the fierce whoosh of fire as it leapt in an arc from one side. Two of the creatures exploded into flame; one of them staggered. It voiced a horrific, hollow howling, a sound that almost tore the litany from the air… …and then it detonated, a nightmare banished. The flames flickered in its wake. The second beast, its flesh burning, turned and threw itself at the women. Beside Jatoya, Akemi hesitated for just too long; the beast landed full on her chest, knocking her over. Eyes and skin afire, its sharp, slavering teeth went for her gorget. Frantically, she scrabbled backwards, her bolter lost, both panicked hands reaching for the thing’s bronze collar. Jatoya leaned down and picked the hound up, one-handed, almost without effort. With pure, physical strength, she slammed it bodily against the nearest pillar. Augusta heard it crack. It fell to the floor, twitching, burning. Firmly, Jatoya brought her boot down on its skull. It exploded with a force that sprayed blood across armour and stone. The flicker of the remaining flames made the building dance with shadows. Jatoya reached her gauntlet to pull Akemi to her feet. ‘Never freeze in battle,’ she said. Her voice was firm but carried no judgment. ‘You know this, Sister. There is no fear. The Emperor is with you.’ ‘Aye.’ Akemi’s tone was full of failure. ‘Say it, Sister Akemi.’ ‘The Emperor is with me.’ Nodding, Jatoya raised the Litany of Battle and Augusta saw Akemi raise her head; she felt her own blood surge in response. She saw Viola stop by a headless pillar, check her field of fire and then take down a single creature with a short, precise burst. Caia called, ‘My auspex is broken, I think. But there are more incoming, Sisters. They’re everywhere!’ Augusta said, ‘To me, all of you. We will hold at the altar!’ They ran. Behind them, the growl rose in volume. It sounded eager, like hunger made manifest, like the creatures of the darkest teachings brought to snarling life. But Augusta knew this, remembered it – she held to the words of the litany and took aim on a skulking hound. Beside her, Melia fired careful, single shots, her breathing tight with fear. The creatures’ snarls grew louder; they were coiling to spring, and any minute now… ‘Viola!’ The other four Sisters had raced up the steps. As she reached Augusta’s location, Viola turned, raised the heavy bolter and cursed. ‘All the rubble’s in the way…’ As Augusta had done, she took the final step, right up to the altar, and turned around. ‘Now.’ Viola grinned, the thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands. ‘Sentio de ira Imperatoris!’ The weapon roared into full life. With it, she thundered the words of the litany. All through the nave, the hounds reeled under the suppression. They shuddered and twisted and crumpled under the impacts. They tried to flee but instead whimpered and detonated, vanishing back to the warp. Some staggered sideways, leaving red smears on the floor, others broke into a full lope, leaping forwards with froth on their chests and their teeth bared. Still more, further back, tried to duck behind the rubble, but Viola’s elevation meant they had nowhere to hide. Music and gunfire boomed from the headless walls. Stone rumbled, and the remains of a pillar cascaded down over the aisle, crushing the hounds beneath. A red mist rose in their wake. Augusta shouted, ‘Hold!’ The bolter was silenced, and the quiet was deafening. Dust blew through the air. ‘Caia.’ Caia said, ‘The screen keeps glitching, I can’t read it properly.’ Viola went to move, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘Stay there. Reload.’ Unmoving, almost unbreathing, the Sisters watched the nave. Augusta watched the auspex in Caia’s hand. Its light flickered and danced. It showed nothing. No motion. No life. The whole cathedral seemed to hold its breath, waiting. And then… One blip. Two. Five. Ten. All clustered down by the main doorway. ‘Where are they coming from?’ Akemi asked. ‘From the crypts,’ Augusta told her, watching the auspex. ‘Viola?’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Hold until I give the word.’ More of the red shapes were coming back into view now, creeping up the ruined aisle. Augusta said, ‘Jatoya, guard our backs. Akemi, that one, there.’ She pointed her chainsword at the nearest snarling hound. ‘Shoot it.’ ‘Sister?’ ‘Shoot it, Sister Akemi, and then keep shooting. Single shots, to the head if you can.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Aware of Akemi’s tension, Augusta took up the litany once more, and felt the younger woman steady. Akemi raised her bolter in both hands, sighted on the bared teeth of the lead hound and pulled the trigger. She hit it clean in the face. Its skull exploded with the impact; the body twisted and was gone. More gore splashed across the stone. ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Like that.’ Augusta shot another, and another. She kept speaking over the barking of the weapon, over the rhythm of the litany. ‘For every stain they’ve made upon this cathedral, we’ll make one of our own. For every death brought by Chaos, we’ll bring a death for the Light of the Emperor. Keep firing, Sister Akemi, and feel His light as you do.’ With Viola still standing above them, heavy bolter in her hands and waiting for the order to resume, the Sisters of the Order raised their voices to the broken walls and shot at the incoming hounds. But the air was still thickening, still choking them. The beasts surged forwards, and Melia fell back. ‘Sister! I… can’t…’ ‘I said keep firing!’ Augusta’s order was a sharp bark. ‘Switch to short bursts, these things cannot be permitted to reach the altar!’ Impossibly, their numbers were still swelling; a seething mass of scarlet that covered the floor of the nave and flowed higher and higher over the rubble. Augusta could feel Viola’s tautness – feel her itching to open fire. She shouted, ‘Now!’ Again, the heavy bolter roared and the beasts smashed backwards in the sudden blast of destruction. But there were too many of them – as the ones in the centre exploded, one after another, there came others, surging at the flanks. Caia cried out as one bounded up at her, teeth bared and hellish eyes glowing. As it opened its jaws, she fell back, tried to put the bolter muzzle in its mouth. But it was too close, and its teeth closed on her elbow. She cried out. Her armour splintered as the thing bit down, and her voice hit a crescendo of pain. She couldn’t use her bolter, but then Melia was beside her, shouting, clubbing the thing on the head with her own weapon, over and over and over again, finding a release for her fear in the sheer fury of the action. Augusta barked an order. Both women fell back as the heavy bolter turned its suppression towards that side of the steps. But the weapon clunked to a stop as the magazine emptied. Cursing, Viola reached for another. Augusta turned and beheaded the closest hound, but they were still coming. Still snarling. And the fear was still clamouring in her chest. The Sister Superior knew that Sister Felicity Albani must have done this. Exactly this. Faced these monsters, this onslaught. And Felicity had surely fallen. But her squad would not. Could not. As Viola replaced her magazine and opened fire once more, as the full suppression drove the beasts back, Augusta prayed aloud. Because she knew, as Felicity must have known, that these were only the vanguard. Somewhere, they had huntmasters, monsters that drove them on. Like the flesh hounds themselves: daemons. Her hand tightened on the bolter. Daemons that had ripped their way through the mines of Hephaestus, driving the people to madness and screaming death. Daemons that had profaned this altar, this place of the Saint and of the God-Emperor. Daemons that had slain her Sisters. Viola gave a shout of defiance and victory – the tide was beginning to falter. Augusta gave her the command to drop back, but still the Sister Superior did not lose her focus. She raised her own weapon to blow the last of them away. But the fight, she knew, was only beginning.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Lautis cathedral was not as Augusta remembered it. Walking down the ruined aisle, the building hollow and roofless over her head, the Sister Superior let her boots ring from the stone. Kawa’s fate and the desecration of the town had left her tight with anger, and she walked bolter in hand, the weapon issuing an outright challenge to whatever was lurking here. With her, her squad walked in double-file. But they could not reach the steps. Unlike their previous visit, the nave was filled with rubble – tumbled pillars, collapsed walls, smashed pieces of fallen buttresses. Augusta knew the pattern of krak grenade debris all too well; she recognised the scars in the stonework where the ammunition of her Sisters had chewed chunks from the rock. She halted, Caia behind her, auspex in hand. ‘Full suppression bursts,’ Caia said. ‘Bolter and heavy bolter alike.’ She paused, studying the spreads of the scars. ‘They fought a retreating action, backwards, up the aisle.’ Turning slowly, studying the instrument in her hand, she pointed. ‘There!’ From beneath the rubble she saw a single, augmetic foot, grip-talons extended as if in some final act of rage or pain. Scatters of warm rain misted across the air. Augusta knelt, carefully moving the rocks. ‘Common construction servitor.’ The thing was smashed to a pulp, the flesh parts of its face rotting and the cogs in its skull all starting to corrode. ‘Melia?’ ‘Been dead longer than the townspeople.’ Melia dropped to one careful knee beside the Sister Superior and turned what was left of the head with a red-gauntleted hand. ‘Flesh doesn’t last in this climate – there’s nothing left but tools and circuitry.’ ‘Jatoya, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved more of the fallen stone. The heap groaned and shifted; scatters of dust and pebbles rolled down its sides. Slowly, they exposed more of the thing, its chest a disintegrating mess of cybernetic organs, its left arm ending in a heavy, stonecutter saw. Its right arm was completely missing. ‘It was fighting something.’ Melia tapped the dried stains on the sawblade. Augusta nodded. ‘They must have been surrounded, or overwhelmed.’ ‘But what could do this?’ Melia asked her. ‘What could move with this sort of swiftness? Overwhelm a squad of our Sisters and a contingent of fully-equipped construction servitors?’ ‘And was it the same thing that emptied the town?’ Augusta’s question was rhetorical; she was still moving the rubble, searching. ‘I do not yet comprehend this, Sisters, not this place and its mysteries, and not this foe. I fear that there are darker things here than orks.’ Melia said nothing. The other four had deployed to a compass defence, covering pillars and archways; Caia still moved her auspex in careful arcs. Augusta’s mention of the orks had returned the memory of their previous battle, and the squad had no intention of being caught a second time. The Sister Superior moved more of the pile. It shuddered and shifted, exposing a second, semi-human body, this one with its face all but missing. She looked down at it, gauging. Servitors could put up a hard and nasty fight – there were worse melee weapons than heavy construction tools. And, like Melia, she did not understand what could have overcome them so swiftly. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We scout by twos, roll call every ninety seconds. Melia, with me. This puzzle requires an answer.’ The squad deployed as it had done once before, spreading out to explore what was left of the transept and cloisters. Augusta kept Melia with her, needing the woman’s medical training – Melia was not a Hospitaller, but her field knowledge was excellent. What they found were pieces. The dismembered remains of the servitors were spread throughout the nave – almost as if some predator had gone on a hunting rampage and had scattered leftovers in its wake. Not one of the corpses remained intact: many of them were missing heads, or limbs, or tools, or tracks. Many more had been disembowelled and their internal organs spread out around them. Yet they found no sign of Jencir himself – and nothing to show what had happened to the Sisters. Melia picked up a servitor’s detached clamp-arm and turned it over. ‘This was bitten,’ she said. She held it out. ‘What can bite through plasteel?’ ‘Very big teeth,’ Augusta commented, taking the limb to examine it. Over the vox, Viola said, ‘There were gun-servitors in the east transept. There’s no sign of whatever took them down.’ ‘Which way are they facing?’ Augusta asked. ‘They’re a mess,’ Viola commented. ‘But my instincts say the attack came from the nave.’ ‘Understood,’ Augusta said. ‘Keep looking.’ ‘Aye.’ Picking their way past the fallen stonework, pieces of it as large as an immolator tank, Augusta and Melia reached the bottom of the steps. Electro-candles had been left here, one on each step climbing towards the altar, but they stood rusting and lightless, now – forgotten. But still, not a single flash of scarlet armour. Bitten. A suspicion was starting to grow in Augusta’s heart. Over the vox, Jatoya’s voice said, ‘West transept clear, proceeding into the cloisters. Looks like the repairs started as scheduled, Sister, there’s a full support framework out here, platforms and scaffolding.’ ‘What of the defences?’ ‘Gun-servitors here, too,’ Jatoya said. ‘Weapons are still half-loaded. Whatever took them down was fast.’ Augusta’s suspicion was solidifying with every word Jatoya said. She paused before the top step. The drop to her knee was as much a part of her faith as drawing breath, but this time, she stayed standing. And her hand tightened on her bolter as the anger surged in her soul. On the Emperor’s high altar, there sat a skull. Just the one. It was – or had been – human, but its plates and eyestalks and mechadendrites identified it easily. Jencir. It had been flayed of all skin and placed in the altar’s centre, exactly where the Holy Aquila should have been. To one side of it lay a rosarius. To the other, a single fleur-de-lys blade. All three items were stained with dried and flaking blood. It had been poured lavishly over them. It had streamed from Jencir’s eye sockets; it had covered the top of the altar, coated its sides and spread out across the stone like a stain. A flicker of sweat stole across Augusta’s skin – like an echo of a dark disquiet. I know this… Melia had stopped at her shoulder. Softly, the Sister Superior murmured a prayer – for the tech-priest, for the profaned altar. She spent a long moment looking, then she stepped onto the top step, the Holy of Holies. With a surge of anger and the slam of one armoured fist, she knocked the skull sideways. It clattered across the chancel and rolled to a stop. ‘Noli timere,’ she said. ‘Feruntur Lucem.’ The words were soft, aimed at the bloodstains, at the dark and eerie creeping in her skin. I do not fear you. I carry the Light. Carefully she picked up the blade and the rosarius and tucked them into her belt. Then she turned around and drew the chainsword with a rasp that echoed down through the nave. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘To me. We are played.’ Melia had put her back to the altar stone, was covering the approach with her bolter. ‘What do you mean?’ Augusta’s suspicions had become a certainty, cold and hard. ‘This was a gift,’ she said. ‘A taunt.’ She stood still, framed by the desecrated altar, by the empty window where the Emperor should have been, resplendent in glassiac and glory. ‘All of you, to me.’ ‘Aye.’ Jatoya’s tones were dangerous; Augusta could hear the squad moving, running for the steps. ‘I have faced this foe before,’ she told them. ‘Witnessed the depths of the horror it brings. It thirsts for blood, and for warfare. It haunts my dreams, and it wakes me in a cold sweat.’ The admission was a warning, not a weakness. ‘And it knows that other members of the Order must come, seeking their Sisters.’ She turned to look through the nave, searching. ‘It has been waiting for us.’ Then she snapped, ‘Like that!’ Unsurprised, she used the blade to point down the steps, indicating a curl of red flesh that crept around the base of a pillar. The motion was sinewy and horribly familiar. It brought a mouthful of anger and bile, echoes of images she could never forget. But her faith burned fiercely and she held herself still, her flickers of fear and fury absolutely controlled. She said, ‘What has teeth that could bite through plasteel?’ Melia cursed. ‘What in Dominica’s name is that? It looks like it’s been…’ ‘Skinned alive.’ She knew these things, these things that brought terror like a herald, like a rush of sickness to their hearts. ‘There.’ She pointed the blade again, at another one, a second slide of hot, red skin. ‘And there.’ And at another, around the pillar opposite. At a fourth, a fifth. Blade still in her hand, she raised her bolter, and began to recite the Litany of Mettle. ‘Et Tu quaeris tibi fortitudinem stare coram nobis…’ We stand before You and ask for Your strength… And more and more of them crept into her line of sight. Augusta knew exactly what the creatures were, had faced them before. On the industrial world of Hephaestus, down in the heart of the ash-choked mines, too much death had summoned them, and they had come. Come hunting. The things were quadrupedal and big; their spiked and sloping shoulders were the height of Augusta’s hip. They had long, yellow fangs, and eyes that burned with unholy light, bright as bloodlust and cruelty. Some had horns on their muzzles; others had back-ridges that spread like batwings. But every single one of them was as red as glistening gore, as red as a newly flayed victim, as red as the Sisters’ own armour. As they crept forwards, they stared, unblinking, at the women. ‘Flesh hounds,’ Augusta said. ‘Denizens of Ruin.’ She held the gaze of the lead beast and stared it down, confronting the fear, the memories. Her heart pounded as the litany trilled through the vox. ‘They can tear through flesh and bone and metal. Overwhelm servo-skulls and servitors alike.’ Beside her, Melia had bolter in hand, but her aim was trembling as she watched the things slink low across the floor. They moved like blood, like the rise of night, and the fear came off them in a wave. Augusta raised her bolter, but she did not fire, not yet. She watched. She watched as more and more of them came into view. They skulked behind the rubble-piles; they lurked in the half-light. Their eyes glowed with hellish colours, and steam rose from their backs. She felt like she was struggling to breathe, like there was a knot of tension in the top of her chest. ‘Single shots,’ she said. ‘Aim carefully and conserve your ammunition – there may be more. Hold steady, my Sisters. The fear is but an illusion, a trick of the dark. His light is with us.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia raised her bolter and shot a creature in the face. It shook its head and growled at her, teeth bared. Saliva sizzled as it hit the stone. At the sound, the others started to snarl, a low, bubbling rasp. It echoed throughout the ruin, rising in volume and fury. The air grew thicker still. Augusta’s grip tightened on blade and bolter both. Then she heard Jatoya, ‘A morte perpetua!’, saw the fierce whoosh of fire as it leapt in an arc from one side. Two of the creatures exploded into flame; one of them staggered. It voiced a horrific, hollow howling, a sound that almost tore the litany from the air… …and then it detonated, a nightmare banished. The flames flickered in its wake. The second beast, its flesh burning, turned and threw itself at the women. Beside Jatoya, Akemi hesitated for just too long; the beast landed full on her chest, knocking her over. Eyes and skin afire, its sharp, slavering teeth went for her gorget. Frantically, she scrabbled backwards, her bolter lost, both panicked hands reaching for the thing’s bronze collar. Jatoya leaned down and picked the hound up, one-handed, almost without effort. With pure, physical strength, she slammed it bodily against the nearest pillar. Augusta heard it crack. It fell to the floor, twitching, burning. Firmly, Jatoya brought her boot down on its skull. It exploded with a force that sprayed blood across armour and stone. The flicker of the remaining flames made the building dance with shadows. Jatoya reached her gauntlet to pull Akemi to her feet. ‘Never freeze in battle,’ she said. Her voice was firm but carried no judgment. ‘You know this, Sister. There is no fear. The Emperor is with you.’ ‘Aye.’ Akemi’s tone was full of failure. ‘Say it, Sister Akemi.’ ‘The Emperor is with me.’ Nodding, Jatoya raised the Litany of Battle and Augusta saw Akemi raise her head; she felt her own blood surge in response. She saw Viola stop by a headless pillar, check her field of fire and then take down a single creature with a short, precise burst. Caia called, ‘My auspex is broken, I think. But there are more incoming, Sisters. They’re everywhere!’ Augusta said, ‘To me, all of you. We will hold at the altar!’ They ran. Behind them, the growl rose in volume. It sounded eager, like hunger made manifest, like the creatures of the darkest teachings brought to snarling life. But Augusta knew this, remembered it – she held to the words of the litany and took aim on a skulking hound. Beside her, Melia fired careful, single shots, her breathing tight with fear. The creatures’ snarls grew louder; they were coiling to spring, and any minute now… ‘Viola!’ The other four Sisters had raced up the steps. As she reached Augusta’s location, Viola turned, raised the heavy bolter and cursed. ‘All the rubble’s in the way…’ As Augusta had done, she took the final step, right up to the altar, and turned around. ‘Now.’ Viola grinned, the thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands. ‘Sentio de ira Imperatoris!’ The weapon roared into full life. With it, she thundered the words of the litany. All through the nave, the hounds reeled under the suppression. They shuddered and twisted and crumpled under the impacts. They tried to flee but instead whimpered and detonated, vanishing back to the warp. Some staggered sideways, leaving red smears on the floor, others broke into a full lope, leaping forwards with froth on their chests and their teeth bared. Still more, further back, tried to duck behind the rubble, but Viola’s elevation meant they had nowhere to hide. Music and gunfire boomed from the headless walls. Stone rumbled, and the remains of a pillar cascaded down over the aisle, crushing the hounds beneath. A red mist rose in their wake. Augusta shouted, ‘Hold!’ The bolter was silenced, and the quiet was deafening. Dust blew through the air. ‘Caia.’ Caia said, ‘The screen keeps glitching, I can’t read it properly.’ Viola went to move, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘Stay there. Reload.’ Unmoving, almost unbreathing, the Sisters watched the nave. Augusta watched the auspex in Caia’s hand. Its light flickered and danced. It showed nothing. No motion. No life. The whole cathedral seemed to hold its breath, waiting. And then… One blip. Two. Five. Ten. All clustered down by the main doorway. ‘Where are they coming from?’ Akemi asked. ‘From the crypts,’ Augusta told her, watching the auspex. ‘Viola?’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Hold until I give the word.’ More of the red shapes were coming back into view now, creeping up the ruined aisle. Augusta said, ‘Jatoya, guard our backs. Akemi, that one, there.’ She pointed her chainsword at the nearest snarling hound. ‘Shoot it.’ ‘Sister?’ ‘Shoot it, Sister Akemi, and then keep shooting. Single shots, to the head if you can.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Aware of Akemi’s tension, Augusta took up the litany once more, and felt the younger woman steady. Akemi raised her bolter in both hands, sighted on the bared teeth of the lead hound and pulled the trigger. She hit it clean in the face. Its skull exploded with the impact; the body twisted and was gone. More gore splashed across the stone. ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Like that.’ Augusta shot another, and another. She kept speaking over the barking of the weapon, over the rhythm of the litany. ‘For every stain they’ve made upon this cathedral, we’ll make one of our own. For every death brought by Chaos, we’ll bring a death for the Light of the Emperor. Keep firing, Sister Akemi, and feel His light as you do.’ With Viola still standing above them, heavy bolter in her hands and waiting for the order to resume, the Sisters of the Order raised their voices to the broken walls and shot at the incoming hounds. But the air was still thickening, still choking them. The beasts surged forwards, and Melia fell back. ‘Sister! I… can’t…’ ‘I said keep firing!’ Augusta’s order was a sharp bark. ‘Switch to short bursts, these things cannot be permitted to reach the altar!’ Impossibly, their numbers were still swelling; a seething mass of scarlet that covered the floor of the nave and flowed higher and higher over the rubble. Augusta could feel Viola’s tautness – feel her itching to open fire. She shouted, ‘Now!’ Again, the heavy bolter roared and the beasts smashed backwards in the sudden blast of destruction. But there were too many of them – as the ones in the centre exploded, one after another, there came others, surging at the flanks. Caia cried out as one bounded up at her, teeth bared and hellish eyes glowing. As it opened its jaws, she fell back, tried to put the bolter muzzle in its mouth. But it was too close, and its teeth closed on her elbow. She cried out. Her armour splintered as the thing bit down, and her voice hit a crescendo of pain. She couldn’t use her bolter, but then Melia was beside her, shouting, clubbing the thing on the head with her own weapon, over and over and over again, finding a release for her fear in the sheer fury of the action. Augusta barked an order. Both women fell back as the heavy bolter turned its suppression towards that side of the steps. But the weapon clunked to a stop as the magazine emptied. Cursing, Viola reached for another. Augusta turned and beheaded the closest hound, but they were still coming. Still snarling. And the fear was still clamouring in her chest. The Sister Superior knew that Sister Felicity Albani must have done this. Exactly this. Faced these monsters, this onslaught. And Felicity had surely fallen. But her squad would not. Could not. As Viola replaced her magazine and opened fire once more, as the full suppression drove the beasts back, Augusta prayed aloud. Because she knew, as Felicity must have known, that these were only the vanguard. Somewhere, they had huntmasters, monsters that drove them on. Like the flesh hounds themselves: daemons. Her hand tightened on the bolter. Daemons that had ripped their way through the mines of Hephaestus, driving the people to madness and screaming death. Daemons that had profaned this altar, this place of the Saint and of the God-Emperor. Daemons that had slain her Sisters. Viola gave a shout of defiance and victory – the tide was beginning to falter. Augusta gave her the command to drop back, but still the Sister Superior did not lose her focus. She raised her own weapon to blow the last of them away. But the fight, she knew, was only beginning.",

And like the echoes of bright lights on closed eyes, they had left red smears across Augusta’s vision. Caia stood with her hand wrapped over her elbow, blood oozing between the fingers of her gauntlet. The wound was deep, but Melia was beside her, chirurgeon’s tools ready. ‘Witch bane and tetraporfaline,’ she said. ‘This will cleanse and heal the wound. Can you move your elbow?’ ‘Not very well,’ Caia said. ‘I feel foolish, letting it get that close.’ She turned to Augusta. ‘What did you say these were?’ Neither Sister had been there upon Hephaestus; they’d never seen these beasts before, never felt their hot breath, never witnessed the destruction they could bring. ‘They’re flesh hounds,’ Augusta said. ‘Khorne’s pets.’ Her voice was tight with anger. ‘They hunt us, test our mettle, wear us down.’ ‘Sister Felicity fought these things?’ Viola asked. ‘I would think so,’ Augusta said. ‘But these are not the things that slew Kawa, nor emptied the town.’ She paused, then said, ‘No, somewhere, these things have a master. Something with purpose.’ Her boot tapped, restless, on the stone. ‘And whatever that purpose may be, we must prevent it. Sisters, we have been called here for this, exactly this. We carry His blade, His bolter, and His name. The forces of darkness cannot withstand us. And we do not fear.’ Augusta placed her gauntleted hand on Akemi’s shoulder. ‘Confidunt in Eo, Akemi. Believe.’ ‘I believe.’ The young woman’s response was fervent. Her bolter had taken lives now, and it had not left her hand. And she had not hesitated again. ‘He is with me.’ ‘Always,’ Augusta said. She let Akemi go, then pulled the data-slate from her belt to call up the maps that Felicity had left them. A wash of pale light bathed their armour. ‘We will progress into the crypts,’ she said. ‘Here.’ She pointed, then indicated various other lines on the map. ‘They’re simple, underchapel, valetudinarium, reliquary – we observed them upon our previous reconnaissance.’ ‘The shipmaster said there were no life signs,’ Viola commented. ‘The density of the stone could have defeated the scans,’ Caia told her. ‘The Sister Superior is right – these beasts must have come from below.’ Jatoya commented, ‘They always come from below.’ Jatoya had been there, upon Hephaestus. Like Augusta, she remembered the screaming. The fire. The hooks. ‘But…’ Viola studied the map, confused. ‘There’s not enough room. How can they?’ ‘A breach in the warp, perhaps,’ Jatoya commented. ‘Though such things are relatively rare.’ Augusta said, ‘Or simply enough bloodshed, somewhere beneath this building… The false gods of Chaos can ­manifest wherever such deeds are performed, even if it is not in their names.’ ‘I have a suggestion.’ The voice was Akemi’s, surprising Augusta slightly, but she let the young woman speak. ‘During the Great Crusade, the cathedrals of the Emperor were often built upon older, local sites. Perhaps this is true of the town?’ ‘Just so.’ Augusta placed the data-slate back in the pack. ‘It may perhaps explain the town’s metalworks – dead things, left over from the Age of Strife.’ The thought made her pause as something in her mind caught on the presence of the tech-priest. Jencir had volunteered for this mission to Lautis, and now she found herself wondering why. She considered for a moment, then banished the thought in favour of more practical matters. ‘I suspect the crypts are not as we remember them.’ Viola snorted, counting her remaining ammunition. She pulled the half-empty magazine from the heavy bolter and replaced it with a full one, slamming the thing home with a noise like pure defiance. ‘Whatever’s lurking down there,’ she said, ‘we will send it straight back to the hell it came from.’ ‘We will cleanse this place,’ Jatoya told her. ‘By His light,’ Augusta said. She sheathed her sword almost regretfully. ‘Viola, on point. Jatoya take the rear. Akemi, stay by me. We fear neither rift nor daemon.’ The crypts were high and vaulted, their ceilings and pillars all swarming with dark clusters of roots. Navigating by jury-rigged strips of lumens – more evidence of Jencir’s explorations – the Sisters came to the bottom of the dipped-smooth steps. Before them, stone sarcophagi lay in a silent circle. Some bore recumbent, robed statues upon their lids, each with his or her hands still crossed in the sign of the aquila. They had been swept clear of dust, and candles left upon them. By the dates on their sides, these were the cathedral’s builders, more recent than the Great Crusade. But something had changed. The air down here should have been still, thick with age. Last time, there had been a single, root-clogged exit – a gap that opened out into an old oubliette – but that had been all. Now a hot wind blew past them like the exhalation from a planet-core forge. ‘No motion,’ Caia said. Her wound had been bound and treated, but the vambrace of her armour was in pieces, and they could not afford to go back for a replacement. Her left gauntlet was missing completely, her hand and forearm bandaged, but bare. ‘But the air’s at thirty-three degrees, and the humidity’s fallen significantly.’ They held a defensive formation while Caia continued to scan. Then she said, ‘It’s coming from the valetudinarium.’ And there it was – the error that Augusta had made. Something so simple, and something that the tech-priest must have found so easily. The room had changed. Augusta remembered it as small – a hospice to serve the people of the town. Now, it stretched outwards, far beyond her memory of it and back into the dark – a huge stone chamber, crumbling with age. Augusta could see where the rubble from the previous wall was tumbled at the room’s edges; the marks of Jencir’s servitors were still visible in the stone. Beside her, Caia watched the auspex. She shook her head as Augusta glanced around. ‘Nothing.’ ‘Look,’ Akemi said, pointing. ‘What’s that?’ Amid the tumbled stone at the wallside, there were fragments that looked different – curves like carved armour. ‘I recall no statue,’ Augusta said. ‘Perhaps it was on the other side?’ Caia’s suggestion drew no answers. Akemi was already kneeling by the pile, finding more of the pieces. ‘It’s not very big,’ she said, finding another, and another, and fitting them like parts of a puzzle. ‘It must have been recessed into the wall.’ Viola stifled a grumble. ‘Do we have time for this?’ ‘Wait,’ Augusta said. Fragments laid out on the floor, the statue was coming together. ‘Sisters…!’ Akemi sat back on her heels. Augusta stared. The statue was familiar – a female figure with her sword held aloft. The blade itself was still missing, but the armour was just like their own… Augusta touched a hand to her fleur-de-lys, but said nothing. She watched as Akemi picked up the final pieces: the statue’s boots and plinth. Akemi said, ‘There’s an inscription.’ As the Sister Superior looked at her, she went on, ‘Fluxu sanguinis vitae nostrae, Et in supplementum it et liber: De quomodo eraserit magos et quod, Velint beatificare illos quasi impotens!’ She brushed at the dust. ‘It’s an older verse, and it means “our Blood and Sacrifice”, but it could… it could be translated in other ways. It could mean “bleeding for survival”, or “blood for our lives”… It must have been a part of the fallen wall.’ ‘Blood for our lives,’ Augusta repeated. The statue was the Saint herself, of course it was, but Augusta could make no sense of it. Why had she not seen it before? Why had it been on the other side of the wall? And in her head, she was remembering Hephaestus’ daemons – creatures of greed and laughter and cruelty. They’d slavered in the mines’ darkness, roared with flame and blood. Their appetites had been more than human, more than– Blood for our lives… She found herself shuddering, and stopped. ‘The curiosity of the Mechanicus is often their undoing,’ Jatoya commented. She indicated a fallen servo-skull, apparently crushed by the tumbling rock. ‘Whatever they loosed in here, it slew them all.’ Her words brought silence as they contemplated the darkness. Fear yammered at them, taunting at the edges of their awareness. The screaming. The fire. The hooks… ‘We are missing something,’ Augusta said. ‘Some piece of the history of this place…’ ‘Sister?’ Akemi stood up, curious. ‘I studied Lautis in some detail, and there is nothing–’ ‘Our answers lie ahead of us,’ Augusta said. ‘We will proceed.’ ‘Aye.’ Viola flicked on her suitlight. Jatoya said, her voice soft, ‘From the begetting of daemons…’ Taking up the prayer, they stepped out of the crypt’s illumination, and into the unknown. As they walked, the construction of the walls began to change. The stone became rougher cut, as if the work had been left somehow unfinished, and the air became steadily hotter and thicker. Augusta was not surprised to see the devices of the sanatorium: the suspended cages, the steel chairs with their swing-down bridles, the tiny cells set back against the walls. But – and the question loomed large in her mind – to whom had they actually belonged? Here, the symbols of the Creed had gone. They had been replaced with odd, geometric designs that looked more like the unnamed machinery in the centre of the town. Augusta stopped, struggling with her memories, with screams that, once again, were echoing in her mind. The town’s machines had come from the Age of Strife, but her understanding of that fact had been academic. Now, she found herself trying to encompass what that really meant. That this had been a godless world, a world of no faith. The concept made the place seem suddenly, horrifically empty. It was a vacuum, bereft of hope or purpose or meaning. Blood for our lives… Blood for the Blood God. For a moment, the horror threatened to bring her down. She longed for a warship – for the armaments to eradicate this hell-planet, once and for all… But she did not have that power, or that choice. She had her faith, and that was enough. The far end of the room opened out onto a balustrade, a walkway that circled the smooth edge of a pit. In the faint illumination of the Sisters’ curious suitlights, it seemed to stretch downwards to the planet’s very heart. When Augusta picked up a stone and dropped it over the edge, there was no sound of it hitting the bottom. About her, the squad had drawn together, tension in their voices as they recited their prayers. Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, and even Viola seemed subdued – her grip on the heavy bolter was vice-tight, as if the weapon was the focus of her courage. On the far side of the room, across the yawning threat of the pit, there waited five – six – other entranceways, each a carved arch in the rock. They were crumbling, layered with moss and roots and vast age. Too regular for mining tunnels – but it no longer mattered. The squad needed to progress, to face their fears, and to find the masters of the hounds… ‘Catacombs.’ Melia shuddered. ‘I wonder what’s down there.’ No one offered an answer. With no choice, they ventured onwards. But Caia’s sense of direction was as sharp as her wits. Despite the still-flickering auspex, she directed them carefully and they moved downwards, always downwards. They passed rusting doorways into more cells, many of them empty. Some showed cold firepits, or elaborate metal frameworks, each sized to hold a human body. Several bore faded red tally marks, hundreds of them, decorating every wall – and leaving them with images of prisoners, abandoned and rotting in eternity. Sometimes, the squad encountered rockfalls or dead ends, and then had to loop back on themselves to try another route. And sometimes they paused, confused, convinced that they had explored this tunnel before. But at last, wordlessly weary, they stumbled into a second open space. And stopped. Here, the roots could no longer penetrate – but eight sarcophagi stood about the walls, each one bearing a grotesque face, its tear-ducts caked with fluid. At the room’s centre, there was a pool, stained to darkness with a layer of desiccating flakes. The chamber offered two further exits, each one carved in the shape of an open mouth. Still on point, Viola’s breathing was harsh. ‘Which way?’ she asked, paused at the entranceway, her head bowed. ‘Or are we just going to get lost again?’ ‘You try navigating,’ Caia answered her, tone sharpening. The Sisters were tired, and the fear of this place was strong – but such behaviour was not to be tolerated. ‘That’s enough.’ Augusta’s order brought silence. ‘This is frustrating, and I understand. But our faith is tested in many ways – and patience is one of them.’ The words were a warning, and the younger members of the squad fell silent. ‘Let us rest,’ Jatoya suggested. ‘And pray. Clear our minds and our hearts. We have good lines of sight and a defensible location. Fifteen-minute rotations for trail rations and water. Viola, Akemi, you first.’ ‘Aye.’ While Melia took a longer look at Caia’s injury, and Jatoya prowled restlessly, flamer in hand, the two chosen Sisters sat on the raised lip of the pool and removed their helmets. Viola’s red hair and freckled skin were sticky with sweat; with a slight shock, the Sister Superior saw that the young woman was more afraid than she’d realised. Viola was hiding it well, but her reactionary bravado was the only thing that was keeping her on her feet. And it may yet get her, and the squad, into trouble. Beside her, Akemi’s pale face was drawn and worried, her shining black bob of hair a curtain as she bowed her head. Augusta came to sit beside them. ‘Pray with me, Sisters,’ she said. ‘For courage to face the darkness. Ego veritatem tuam. Vos ipsi nos docuit non timere, quia tu omnia superare.’ I hold to Your truth. You have taught us not to fear, for You have overcome all. Leaving Caia to study the sarcophagi, Melia broke out the flatbreads that were their ration packs – condensed, super-nutritional foodstuffs that tasted like solidified gruel. As Augusta finished speaking, she handed one to each of the younger Sisters. Viola, her helmet in her lap, pulled a face. ‘Might be easier to starve.’ Her quip sounded almost like relief. It made Akemi laugh. The sound was so unexpected – and so utterly out of place – that Augusta turned away, hiding a smile. In the midst of all this horror, a prayer could still bring strength and joy. ‘Eat it,’ Melia said, her tones amused. ‘You cannot battle monsters on an empty belly.’ Caia had paused at one of the sarcophagi, frowning. ‘These are hollow,’ she said. She tapped the metal sculpture and then used her fleur-de-lys blade to prise the front of it open. Akemi leapt upright, spitting her rations across the stone. Augusta stared, her memories suddenly moving, curling like smoke… The screaming… The fire… The hooks… From inside had slumped a body, run through with two dozen metal spikes. The corpse was recent, dried out like old grox-leather, and still in the garb of the town. ‘The townsfolk came here?’ Caia said. Her voice was soaked in dismay. Wordless, Jatoya pointed her flamer-muzzle downwards, indicating the floor. At the sarcophagus’ feet, there was a gutter in the rock, a straight line that led to the pool. It, too, was caked in the now-familiar flaking darkness. ‘More blood,’ Augusta said. She was tense, shaking; her head echoed with remembered cries of pain. ‘And more blood. The taint of Chaos is strong here, and it lured them from their homes.’ ‘Perhaps it has been here from the beginning,’ Jatoya said, her tone bleak. ‘Soaked into the stone.’ Melia said, ‘Perhaps that’s why the wall in the valetudinarium was constructed. When the Great Crusade came to Lautis, the people wished to embrace the Light, to forget the bloodshed of their past–’ ‘The cathedral is younger than the Crusade,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘It was built many centuries later than the town.’ ‘Then perhaps it was built to convert the more reluctant,’ Caia said, ‘and then walled off when it was no longer of use. Either way–’ ‘Either way.’ Augusta said, her tone like steel. ‘We will cleanse this holy place of the presence of Chaos.’ ‘Maybe we should feed them some of this – it’s guaranteed to kill anything.’ Viola stashed the last of her rations, and clicked her helmet back into place. She picked up the heavy bolter, checked its ammunition. Jatoya said, ‘We will cut the rest of the break until we have a better location. Sister Caia?’ A glimmer of green bathed Caia’s faceplate. ‘Scanning.’ Augusta’s preysight could see the faint blur of warmth that came from each entrance, the constant, exhaled sigh that was the hot breath of Chaos. But they both glowed the same, neither brighter than the other. Caia shook her head, shrugged. ‘I’m sorry, Sister, I still have no reading. We could walk down here until we perished from exhaustion. Which way do we choose?’ The squad remained silent, oddly reluctant. Augusta could feel the darkness as if it blurred the sharp edges of her mind. She whispered, ‘Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris.’ Guide me, my Emperor. ‘Contact!’ Caia suddenly said, her voice like a pulse of alarm. ‘Left-hand tunnel.’ The prayer of thanks was a rush, a touch of His grace in the silence of this sweating hell. She said, ‘How close?’ The light from the auspex glittered green. ‘Five hundred yards,’ Caia said. ‘And closing.’ ‘Defensive formation, we’ll hold back from the doorway. Jatoya, watch the other exit.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘What is it?’ Viola’s tone was sharp. ‘More hounds?’ Caia said, ‘Too slow for hounds. Moving wrong.’ Then Augusta saw a faint flicker of light from the far side of the chamber. In the tunnel mouth opposite, there was a figure, a brass firebrand raised in one hand. It moved slowly, but the sight of it was completely unexpected. She stared. It was an ork, its bolt-on steel jaw pitted with rust-red moss. Viola raised the heavy bolter. ‘Wait!’ Augusta said, puzzled. Behind the ork came a second greenskin, this one smaller and slighter. Both creatures had great, carved scars in their hides, spikes of brass embedded in their skin. And then, behind them, came a woman in the garb of the township, her clothing torn and bloody, her eyes torn out. She carried an orkish axe in one thin hand. More figures closed in behind her, their flesh ripped open, their faces scarred with staples and stitches. And all of them stared at the Sisters with teeth bared and gazes that burned like fire. Like fanaticism. Every one of them, orks included, had the same symbol upon the flesh of their foreheads, etched there in dripping black fluid. Khorne. Tightly, Augusta let out her breath. The townspeople had not been slain – they’d deserted their homes and farms and workshops, left everything behind them. Kawa, the priest, had resisted, had fought and been executed – the headless bodies in the town plaza must have been those with the strength to have followed her. But the rest had faltered from their faith, drawn by some ancient, buried bloodlust that had stirred in their darkest hearts, in their deepest ancestry. Khorne. It made her wonder about the town’s strange machines – had they somehow been made of the darkness here, inspired by the long presence of Chaos? More figures were assembling now, eyes flaming with madness. Like the daemonic hounds, they had no sense; they were hungry, thirsty, greedy. Their teeth were bared in skull-grins. For an instant, everything was still. And then, howling, the horde came at them. The people had no weapons, no armour, no technology. They carried the occasional axe, left over from the orks’ raids, or farm tools brought from the town itself. Some bore pieces of Jencir’s fallen scaffolding. But they had nothing to face, or to resist, the Sisters’ bolters. ‘Viola!’ Augusta ordered. The first suppression cut them down in their scores. But they didn’t care; they threw themselves over the dead and the dying, and they just kept coming. Augusta knew what this was – knew what they were doing. This was just more blood, more lives, more fuel, but there was no other choice. If they did not defend themselves, these people would do their best to tear the Sisters to pieces. And they were heretics, and deserved no mercy. On another command, Viola fell back to reload and the other four bolters opened up. Melia chanted the litany in the vox, her voice angry. Always the gentlest of them, this was not how she saw her faith, and Augusta knew that she did not wish to do this. Yet still, she was a warrior to her core, and she fired without hesitation. A large, balding man pushed to the fore, a ball of flames seeming to burn in his overhanging belly. She took him down with a single shot. Somewhere, Augusta thought she could hear laughing, deep and harsh and exultant. ‘Hold!’ Viola had slammed another magazine in the bolter. ‘Sister?’ She raised the weapon, unsure what the Sister Superior was doing. ‘Hold your fire.’ The furious barking of the bolters stopped. The people kept coming, clawing over the top of one another. Their hands were covered in the blood of their fellows; they picked up fallen weapons and left their friends to suffer and die. They had no awareness of themselves, or of each other, or of what they had been. Or of the occasional greenskin, no different to the rest. ‘Cover me,’ Augusta said. Viola nodded. ‘Aye.’ The Sister Superior clipped her bolter back to her belt, drew her blade, but did not start the mechanism. She stepped in front of her squad and began to recite, her voice ringing from the stone. ‘Quod haereticum de prioribus surrexit. Videt Imperator non est Lux…’ The heretic has risen, he sees not the Emperor’s Light… Behind her, her squad joined the words of the Litany of Banishment, the strength of their faith fighting back against the mad eyes of the incoming villagers. But it was not enough. If Augusta had hoped to stop the people by the power of her faith alone, she was failing – the grip of the bloodlust was too old, and too strong. As they reached her, she slashed at first one and then another with the still-silent chainsword, then stepped back and gave the order for Viola to resume firing. The heavy bolter cut the people down and covered the stone in more blood, and more blood. Slowly, the runnels and the pool filled with it. Melia shook her head, but she raised her bolter and shot again. And then they saw something else.",

About her, the squad had drawn together, tension in their voices as they recited their prayers. Akemi’s fetish was back in her fingers, and even Viola seemed subdued – her grip on the heavy bolter was vice-tight, as if the weapon was the focus of her courage. On the far side of the room, across the yawning threat of the pit, there waited five – six – other entranceways, each a carved arch in the rock. They were crumbling, layered with moss and roots and vast age. Too regular for mining tunnels – but it no longer mattered. The squad needed to progress, to face their fears, and to find the masters of the hounds… ‘Catacombs.’ Melia shuddered. ‘I wonder what’s down there.’ No one offered an answer. With no choice, they ventured onwards. But Caia’s sense of direction was as sharp as her wits. Despite the still-flickering auspex, she directed them carefully and they moved downwards, always downwards. They passed rusting doorways into more cells, many of them empty. Some showed cold firepits, or elaborate metal frameworks, each sized to hold a human body. Several bore faded red tally marks, hundreds of them, decorating every wall – and leaving them with images of prisoners, abandoned and rotting in eternity. Sometimes, the squad encountered rockfalls or dead ends, and then had to loop back on themselves to try another route. And sometimes they paused, confused, convinced that they had explored this tunnel before. But at last, wordlessly weary, they stumbled into a second open space. And stopped. Here, the roots could no longer penetrate – but eight sarcophagi stood about the walls, each one bearing a grotesque face, its tear-ducts caked with fluid. At the room’s centre, there was a pool, stained to darkness with a layer of desiccating flakes. The chamber offered two further exits, each one carved in the shape of an open mouth. Still on point, Viola’s breathing was harsh. ‘Which way?’ she asked, paused at the entranceway, her head bowed. ‘Or are we just going to get lost again?’ ‘You try navigating,’ Caia answered her, tone sharpening. The Sisters were tired, and the fear of this place was strong – but such behaviour was not to be tolerated. ‘That’s enough.’ Augusta’s order brought silence. ‘This is frustrating, and I understand. But our faith is tested in many ways – and patience is one of them.’ The words were a warning, and the younger members of the squad fell silent. ‘Let us rest,’ Jatoya suggested. ‘And pray. Clear our minds and our hearts. We have good lines of sight and a defensible location. Fifteen-minute rotations for trail rations and water. Viola, Akemi, you first.’ ‘Aye.’ While Melia took a longer look at Caia’s injury, and Jatoya prowled restlessly, flamer in hand, the two chosen Sisters sat on the raised lip of the pool and removed their helmets. Viola’s red hair and freckled skin were sticky with sweat; with a slight shock, the Sister Superior saw that the young woman was more afraid than she’d realised. Viola was hiding it well, but her reactionary bravado was the only thing that was keeping her on her feet. And it may yet get her, and the squad, into trouble. Beside her, Akemi’s pale face was drawn and worried, her shining black bob of hair a curtain as she bowed her head. Augusta came to sit beside them. ‘Pray with me, Sisters,’ she said. ‘For courage to face the darkness. Ego veritatem tuam. Vos ipsi nos docuit non timere, quia tu omnia superare.’ I hold to Your truth. You have taught us not to fear, for You have overcome all. Leaving Caia to study the sarcophagi, Melia broke out the flatbreads that were their ration packs – condensed, super-nutritional foodstuffs that tasted like solidified gruel. As Augusta finished speaking, she handed one to each of the younger Sisters. Viola, her helmet in her lap, pulled a face. ‘Might be easier to starve.’ Her quip sounded almost like relief. It made Akemi laugh. The sound was so unexpected – and so utterly out of place – that Augusta turned away, hiding a smile. In the midst of all this horror, a prayer could still bring strength and joy. ‘Eat it,’ Melia said, her tones amused. ‘You cannot battle monsters on an empty belly.’ Caia had paused at one of the sarcophagi, frowning. ‘These are hollow,’ she said. She tapped the metal sculpture and then used her fleur-de-lys blade to prise the front of it open. Akemi leapt upright, spitting her rations across the stone. Augusta stared, her memories suddenly moving, curling like smoke… The screaming… The fire… The hooks… From inside had slumped a body, run through with two dozen metal spikes. The corpse was recent, dried out like old grox-leather, and still in the garb of the town. ‘The townsfolk came here?’ Caia said. Her voice was soaked in dismay. Wordless, Jatoya pointed her flamer-muzzle downwards, indicating the floor. At the sarcophagus’ feet, there was a gutter in the rock, a straight line that led to the pool. It, too, was caked in the now-familiar flaking darkness. ‘More blood,’ Augusta said. She was tense, shaking; her head echoed with remembered cries of pain. ‘And more blood. The taint of Chaos is strong here, and it lured them from their homes.’ ‘Perhaps it has been here from the beginning,’ Jatoya said, her tone bleak. ‘Soaked into the stone.’ Melia said, ‘Perhaps that’s why the wall in the valetudinarium was constructed. When the Great Crusade came to Lautis, the people wished to embrace the Light, to forget the bloodshed of their past–’ ‘The cathedral is younger than the Crusade,’ Augusta reminded her. ‘It was built many centuries later than the town.’ ‘Then perhaps it was built to convert the more reluctant,’ Caia said, ‘and then walled off when it was no longer of use. Either way–’ ‘Either way.’ Augusta said, her tone like steel. ‘We will cleanse this holy place of the presence of Chaos.’ ‘Maybe we should feed them some of this – it’s guaranteed to kill anything.’ Viola stashed the last of her rations, and clicked her helmet back into place. She picked up the heavy bolter, checked its ammunition. Jatoya said, ‘We will cut the rest of the break until we have a better location. Sister Caia?’ A glimmer of green bathed Caia’s faceplate. ‘Scanning.’ Augusta’s preysight could see the faint blur of warmth that came from each entrance, the constant, exhaled sigh that was the hot breath of Chaos. But they both glowed the same, neither brighter than the other. Caia shook her head, shrugged. ‘I’m sorry, Sister, I still have no reading. We could walk down here until we perished from exhaustion. Which way do we choose?’ The squad remained silent, oddly reluctant. Augusta could feel the darkness as if it blurred the sharp edges of her mind. She whispered, ‘Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris.’ Guide me, my Emperor. ‘Contact!’ Caia suddenly said, her voice like a pulse of alarm. ‘Left-hand tunnel.’ The prayer of thanks was a rush, a touch of His grace in the silence of this sweating hell. She said, ‘How close?’ The light from the auspex glittered green. ‘Five hundred yards,’ Caia said. ‘And closing.’ ‘Defensive formation, we’ll hold back from the doorway. Jatoya, watch the other exit.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘What is it?’ Viola’s tone was sharp. ‘More hounds?’ Caia said, ‘Too slow for hounds. Moving wrong.’ Then Augusta saw a faint flicker of light from the far side of the chamber. In the tunnel mouth opposite, there was a figure, a brass firebrand raised in one hand. It moved slowly, but the sight of it was completely unexpected. She stared. It was an ork, its bolt-on steel jaw pitted with rust-red moss. Viola raised the heavy bolter. ‘Wait!’ Augusta said, puzzled. Behind the ork came a second greenskin, this one smaller and slighter. Both creatures had great, carved scars in their hides, spikes of brass embedded in their skin. And then, behind them, came a woman in the garb of the township, her clothing torn and bloody, her eyes torn out. She carried an orkish axe in one thin hand. More figures closed in behind her, their flesh ripped open, their faces scarred with staples and stitches. And all of them stared at the Sisters with teeth bared and gazes that burned like fire. Like fanaticism. Every one of them, orks included, had the same symbol upon the flesh of their foreheads, etched there in dripping black fluid. Khorne. Tightly, Augusta let out her breath. The townspeople had not been slain – they’d deserted their homes and farms and workshops, left everything behind them. Kawa, the priest, had resisted, had fought and been executed – the headless bodies in the town plaza must have been those with the strength to have followed her. But the rest had faltered from their faith, drawn by some ancient, buried bloodlust that had stirred in their darkest hearts, in their deepest ancestry. Khorne. It made her wonder about the town’s strange machines – had they somehow been made of the darkness here, inspired by the long presence of Chaos? More figures were assembling now, eyes flaming with madness. Like the daemonic hounds, they had no sense; they were hungry, thirsty, greedy. Their teeth were bared in skull-grins. For an instant, everything was still. And then, howling, the horde came at them. The people had no weapons, no armour, no technology. They carried the occasional axe, left over from the orks’ raids, or farm tools brought from the town itself. Some bore pieces of Jencir’s fallen scaffolding. But they had nothing to face, or to resist, the Sisters’ bolters. ‘Viola!’ Augusta ordered. The first suppression cut them down in their scores. But they didn’t care; they threw themselves over the dead and the dying, and they just kept coming. Augusta knew what this was – knew what they were doing. This was just more blood, more lives, more fuel, but there was no other choice. If they did not defend themselves, these people would do their best to tear the Sisters to pieces. And they were heretics, and deserved no mercy. On another command, Viola fell back to reload and the other four bolters opened up. Melia chanted the litany in the vox, her voice angry. Always the gentlest of them, this was not how she saw her faith, and Augusta knew that she did not wish to do this. Yet still, she was a warrior to her core, and she fired without hesitation. A large, balding man pushed to the fore, a ball of flames seeming to burn in his overhanging belly. She took him down with a single shot. Somewhere, Augusta thought she could hear laughing, deep and harsh and exultant. ‘Hold!’ Viola had slammed another magazine in the bolter. ‘Sister?’ She raised the weapon, unsure what the Sister Superior was doing. ‘Hold your fire.’ The furious barking of the bolters stopped. The people kept coming, clawing over the top of one another. Their hands were covered in the blood of their fellows; they picked up fallen weapons and left their friends to suffer and die. They had no awareness of themselves, or of each other, or of what they had been. Or of the occasional greenskin, no different to the rest. ‘Cover me,’ Augusta said. Viola nodded. ‘Aye.’ The Sister Superior clipped her bolter back to her belt, drew her blade, but did not start the mechanism. She stepped in front of her squad and began to recite, her voice ringing from the stone. ‘Quod haereticum de prioribus surrexit. Videt Imperator non est Lux…’ The heretic has risen, he sees not the Emperor’s Light… Behind her, her squad joined the words of the Litany of Banishment, the strength of their faith fighting back against the mad eyes of the incoming villagers. But it was not enough. If Augusta had hoped to stop the people by the power of her faith alone, she was failing – the grip of the bloodlust was too old, and too strong. As they reached her, she slashed at first one and then another with the still-silent chainsword, then stepped back and gave the order for Viola to resume firing. The heavy bolter cut the people down and covered the stone in more blood, and more blood. Slowly, the runnels and the pool filled with it. Melia shook her head, but she raised her bolter and shot again. And then they saw something else.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN In among the people of the town, there was a face Augusta knew. An older face, male, lined with sun and smiling – she remembered his name as Subul. He had been one of Kawa’s followers, strong in his faith. Now he had the symbol of Khorne carved deep into his forehead, and his own blood was caked dark around his eyes. ‘Hold!’ She commanded the squad to cease fire. The people were stopping. They looked like the hounds, snarling and straining, but Subul seemed to be their leader and their voice, and they paused to let him come forwards. ‘I knew you would come back,’ he said to her. ‘Sister.’ His voice was deep and layered with power. He wore horror like a cloak. He raised his chin, facing her down. Around him, the villagers stared, their eyes full of lunacy. A single ork stood with them, as daemon-crazed as the rest. ‘It was you,’ Augusta said. ‘You led them here.’ ‘Of course.’ He grinned. ‘They followed me, and willingly. They dragged Kawa from her home, and offered her to the oldest god of all, the god of our past! Some offered their skulls, others… still wait for that honour.’ He spread his hands like a conjurer. ‘Witness,’ he said. ‘Innocent lives – the lives you once swore to protect and save. What will you do, Sister? Will you gun them down?’ ‘They have turned from the Light,’ Augusta said. ‘Forsaken the Emperor–’ ‘Emperor, Emperor, Emperor.’ Subul snorted. ‘What is your Emperor but a corpse? What is your Emperor but a rotting excuse for your barbarous acts? How many times have you witnessed his punishments, the horrors done in his name – they all lurk here, Sister, you have seen them! We are the same, you and I – soaked in the blood of innocents.’ He was staring at her, his expression livid, intense. ‘Join us, Augusta. Join us as your Sisters did.’ What? That stung. Her hand tightened on her blade and she stood to her full height, inhaling the hot stink. ‘Felicity would not surrender her faith. She is a member of the Order, a follower–’ ‘Of Saint Mina?’ His laugh was harsh, mocking, laden with implication. ‘Felicity saw the truth, Augusta. Saw the truth of your Order’s history, its thirst for blood. Saw what you red-clad women really are.’ ‘You will perish by my hand,’ Augusta told him. ‘By my faith.’ ‘You and your false God.’ Subul grinned, the expression savage and somehow wider than his face. His teeth were sharp and coated in gore, in shreds of flesh. ‘Do you not know where you are, Sister Superior, where you have blundered in your ignorance and your blind faith? You have your eyes so fixed on Terra, you cannot even see your boots.’ ‘I do not play these word games.’ Augusta snorted. ‘You are a heretic, and I am done speaking with you.’ The people were chanting now, rhythmic and soft. It sounded almost like the Sisters’ battle litany, but the words had been warped, twisted. That we wouldst bring them only death… That we wouldst spare none… The villagers began to move forwards again, their eyes afire, their hands outstretched. They passed Subul and spread outwards into the chamber. Augusta stepped back, allowing her squad their field of fire. ‘Then gun them down,’ Subul said, as they surrounded and concealed him. ‘They are weaponless, defenceless. Gun them down and fulfil your warlike cravings!’ ‘You cannot assail my faith,’ Augusta said. ‘They are heretics. I shall not suffer their lives.’ Behind her, five bolters cocked ready with a noise that rang from the rock. The people of the town died. Despite Subul’s taunting, Augusta had no doubts – the people had followed falsehood, and their lives were forfeit so that their souls might still be saved. They had no hope facing the Sisters’ weapons, and they fell and they bled and they died, and their lives leaked slowly into the filling pool. As the bolters finally silenced, as Caia and Melia walked among the dead, Augusta found herself staring at the floor. The blood was soaking into stone, spreading out through the rock by some strange osmosis, some chemical effect that she did not fully understand. Soaked into the stone, Jatoya had said. The truth of your Order’s history… An odd, cold chill went down her back – something she was missing, something else that was happening here… Not just the daemon, something more. Akemi, her armour spattered in blood and her bolter still smoking, said, ‘He made us take the daemon’s lives for it.’ She was beside Augusta, staring at the now-full pool, and her voice contained the first hints of anger, new and jagged. ‘He made us feed it.’ ‘These people, Akemi,’ Augusta told her, ‘have been saved twice. They walk in the Light.’ Akemi looked around at the destruction, the twisted spread of death that the Sisters had wrought. ‘I understand that,’ she said. ‘But I… I dislike being a game piece.’ ‘Hold to your anger, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘It a gift from the Emperor and it brings you courage, and resolve. But…’ she paused, holding Akemi’s gaze through her visor, ‘…control it. Never let it master you.’ The vox crackled as the responding channel opened, but before Akemi could voice her answer, Augusta heard something else. Something moving. Something big. The vox-channel closed again as all six women stopped to listen. The corruption was moving, out there in the tunnels. It felt like power, like cruelty, like hunger, like anger. It seemed to pulse through the very stone. ‘I cannot see Subul,’ Jatoya commented. Augusta looked round at her second-in-command. ‘We must find him.’ ‘He is not among the dead,’ Melia said. ‘He must have used the people to cover his escape. Though where he was going…’ ‘Can we not follow him?’ Augusta asked. ‘I suspect he will lead us to the heart of this complex.’ The truth of your Order’s history… Do you not know where you are? What had he meant? But she dismissed the thought – she had no time for speculation. Akemi was right, somewhere, the hounds’ masters were gathering power, sucking in the blood and the souls that had been shed within their auspice. As if it had heard her, the sound came again – deep laughter, mocking and rich and hot. It came with a flare of pure greed, a craving sense of fury and appetite that made the sweat slide down Augusta’s back. We are the same, you and I – soaked in the blood of innocents… Viola raised the heavy bolter. She indicated the far side of the chamber, and the doorway that Caia was now scanning with the auspex. ‘We can follow him,’ Caia said. ‘If we move swiftly, and he stays within our range.’ ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Let us not release him from our sight.’ Viola stood up, heavy bolter reloaded and ready to take point, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘No, Sister,’ she said. ‘Walk rearguard and ensure nothing is following us. Jatoya, take point.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad’s second-in-command came forward to take Viola’s place, and Viola moved as ordered – but Augusta did not miss the resentful flash in the younger woman’s bright green eyes. They headed further into the maze. Here, the walls of the tunnels were studded with skulls in the manner of an ossuary, bleached-white bones in elaborate patterns, streaked with blackened and ancient blood. In places, the angled and leering spirits of the Age of Strife were etched into the stone, their obsidian and mica covered with long-congealed gore. The Sisters’ suitlights moved across the patterns of the dead. Between the bones, silent archways opened in every direction, caked with the rust-coloured moss. Behind them, endless corridors led away into the darkness. The Sisters had no idea where they were. Augusta found herself fighting for breath, fighting the sensation that the weight of the rock above her was pressing, down, down upon her shoulders, that she would falter and fall, and the darkness would rise to swallow them as it had done upon Hephaestus. Beside her, Melia had stopped. She was leaning against the wall, trying to reload her already loaded bolter. Augusta put a hand on her arm. ‘Stop. The weapon is ready. It holds the faith of our Order and its own strength. Remember to pray, Melia, the Litany of Truth. It will clear your mind of the darkness.’ Melia said, her voice shaking, ‘Ego veritatem tuam.’ ‘We must go on. Cleanse the core of this place.’ Do you not know where you are? A curl of fear was growing in Augusta’s heart. She knew that they should check every tunnel, that they should ensure their exit route, and not leave the possibility of enemies at their backs. But she also knew that they could not let Subul get too far ahead of them. And her instinct told her to head down, always down, that the thing they sought lurked somewhere in the catacombs’ bowels. And that they needed to reach it before Subul assaulted them again, and its power grew. At last they came through the final skull-framed archway and turned down a wider, stone tunnel that was precarious with its sharp descent. Here, the moss was even thicker. It made their footing soft and slippery, and it filled the air with spores that seemed to hover like insects. It also interfered with their preysight, and further confused the auspex in Caia’s hand. But still, they headed steadily down. Side exits became smaller and more uneven, and many led upwards, back towards the light; tiny rooms offered stone beds that indicated cells, these ones empty of devices. At some point, people had lived down here. But those people were long gone – now, there was only the darkness. And the more they progressed, the more Augusta could feel it, that hot, close pressure that seemed to condense in her chest, making her breathing thick and heavy. She began to recite the Litany of Mettle, feeling the others steady as she did so. They moved on, Jatoya’s quiet strength at their head. As they advanced, the hot wind became stronger, blowing in their faces from something ahead of them. From the place, Augusta was sure, where the daemon would be manifest. But when they reached the end of the tunnel, even the Sister Superior stopped to draw in a breath. The tunnel opened out onto a walkway, a flat and narrow span of stone that crossed a chamber like some vast and bottomless pit. Jatoya had paused in the cover of the tunnel-mouth – her flamer was a shorter-range weapon and of little use unless they were attacked upon the bridge. Augusta came forwards to look out over the drop. Beside the bridge and stretching down into the darkness were eight titanic, carved figures, hundreds of yards tall. They bore masks with gruesome, tooth-filled grins, carried blades or great whips in iron and brass and volcanic stone. And at their feet, somewhere far below, there was the faintest glimmer of flame. Augusta’s certainty was absolute – the Emperor had guided them. This was exactly where they were meant to be. ‘We will find a way down,’ Augusta said. ‘Caia?’ ‘Subul has turned away from the main passage, and is still ahead of us.’ She indicated the last of the side-tunnels, a maw into darkness. ‘If we want to keep him in range, we’ll need to follow him, and swiftly.’ ‘There is corruption below us,’ Augusta said. ‘I can hear it, feel it. We must face it.’ ‘Is the bridge secure?’ Jatoya asked. ‘The density of the stone is unchanging, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘The bridge is secure.’ ‘Good,’ she said. ‘Sister Superior – what is your decision? Do we pursue Subul, or do we cross?’ Augusta came to the very edge of the tunnel and looked out over the drop, her belly lurching. The floor was too far to see, but the flashes of firelight were unmistakeable. ‘We cross by twos,’ she said. ‘Jatoya, Caia, you first, and secure the far side. The rest of you, watch and give covering fire. If anything moves, shoot it.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. She paused to eye the open expanse of the bridge. ‘On the double, Sister Caia. Ready?’ The two women timed themselves the count of three and then ran, tiny red figures in the expanse of the chamber, their black and white cloaks snapping behind them as they raced across. Caia slipped and Jatoya paused to steady her companion, but they reached the far side without mishap. ‘Melia, Akemi.’ Two more red figures ran. At the rear, Augusta glanced at Viola. She had left them until the last deliberately, and now she put her hand on the younger woman’s shoulder. Over a private vox-channel, she said, ‘Steady, Viola. You are strong, and you’ve come a long way from the young woman who shot the ork warlord.’ Viola said only, ‘Aye.’ She seemed to think about it for a moment, then added, ‘I wish this were that simple.’ Augusta chuckled, the sound one of long years of battle experience. ‘One thing the God-Emperor teaches,’ she said, ‘is that no two fights, no two foes, are ever the same. Trust in His wisdom and remain strong.’ Viola nodded, looked as though she was about to say something further, but a cry across the vox made them both look up and across the chasm. ‘Sister!’ The voice was Jatoya. ‘You need to bear witness!’ Augusta gave Viola’s shoulder a brief, tight grip, then let her go. And they ran. Augusta was not wild about heights. She wasn’t afraid of them, exactly, but they made her queasy to the pit of her stomach – of all the tests of her faith, drop-pod missions were about her least favoured. But, as ever, she pushed the nausea aside – she could not indulge such things. As she ran, though, she was still painfully aware that they had no cover, and that if anything shot at them, there would be nothing they could do – even if a bullet did not penetrate their armour, the impact would be enough to make them fall. Down, down into the depths… They reached the far side safely. As they crossed once more into the security of the surrounding stone, Caia was there to meet them, her injured arm cradled to her, her breathing harsh. ‘We found the others.’ Her voice caught. ‘But Felicity…’ The weight of the sentence was enough. Augusta pushed past her and into the last room, the final room of the complex that was not the lurking pit below. ‘By the Light!’ Dropping to her knees, she touched the front of her armour, her heart in her mouth. Another mockery, another taunt. In here lay the remains of Sister Felicity’s squad – ­shattered armour, rotting and dismembered limbs. They had been arranged in a pattern, deliberate, some ghoulish mockery or design, and five flayed skulls sat in a pile in the centre, all of them covered in blood. Five. Not six. Felicity herself was still missing. Viola had stayed by the exit and was still watching the bridge. The rest of the squad joined the Sister Superior, kneeling to the members of their Order, now lost to the darkness. ‘Blessed be their memories.’ They stayed like that for a long moment, repeating the prayer. Then Melia pulled a small candle from her kit and placed it upon the floor, lighting it with a prayer of her own. ‘We will not let this pass,’ Melia said. She, too, was beginning to sound angry. ‘We will finish this.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta told her. ‘We will. And then we will place the monster’s head upon the altar of the cathedral itself.’",

They walk in the Light.’ Akemi looked around at the destruction, the twisted spread of death that the Sisters had wrought. ‘I understand that,’ she said. ‘But I… I dislike being a game piece.’ ‘Hold to your anger, Sister,’ Augusta told her. ‘It a gift from the Emperor and it brings you courage, and resolve. But…’ she paused, holding Akemi’s gaze through her visor, ‘…control it. Never let it master you.’ The vox crackled as the responding channel opened, but before Akemi could voice her answer, Augusta heard something else. Something moving. Something big. The vox-channel closed again as all six women stopped to listen. The corruption was moving, out there in the tunnels. It felt like power, like cruelty, like hunger, like anger. It seemed to pulse through the very stone. ‘I cannot see Subul,’ Jatoya commented. Augusta looked round at her second-in-command. ‘We must find him.’ ‘He is not among the dead,’ Melia said. ‘He must have used the people to cover his escape. Though where he was going…’ ‘Can we not follow him?’ Augusta asked. ‘I suspect he will lead us to the heart of this complex.’ The truth of your Order’s history… Do you not know where you are? What had he meant? But she dismissed the thought – she had no time for speculation. Akemi was right, somewhere, the hounds’ masters were gathering power, sucking in the blood and the souls that had been shed within their auspice. As if it had heard her, the sound came again – deep laughter, mocking and rich and hot. It came with a flare of pure greed, a craving sense of fury and appetite that made the sweat slide down Augusta’s back. We are the same, you and I – soaked in the blood of innocents… Viola raised the heavy bolter. She indicated the far side of the chamber, and the doorway that Caia was now scanning with the auspex. ‘We can follow him,’ Caia said. ‘If we move swiftly, and he stays within our range.’ ‘Good,’ Augusta said. ‘Let us not release him from our sight.’ Viola stood up, heavy bolter reloaded and ready to take point, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘No, Sister,’ she said. ‘Walk rearguard and ensure nothing is following us. Jatoya, take point.’ ‘Aye.’ The squad’s second-in-command came forward to take Viola’s place, and Viola moved as ordered – but Augusta did not miss the resentful flash in the younger woman’s bright green eyes. They headed further into the maze. Here, the walls of the tunnels were studded with skulls in the manner of an ossuary, bleached-white bones in elaborate patterns, streaked with blackened and ancient blood. In places, the angled and leering spirits of the Age of Strife were etched into the stone, their obsidian and mica covered with long-congealed gore. The Sisters’ suitlights moved across the patterns of the dead. Between the bones, silent archways opened in every direction, caked with the rust-coloured moss. Behind them, endless corridors led away into the darkness. The Sisters had no idea where they were. Augusta found herself fighting for breath, fighting the sensation that the weight of the rock above her was pressing, down, down upon her shoulders, that she would falter and fall, and the darkness would rise to swallow them as it had done upon Hephaestus. Beside her, Melia had stopped. She was leaning against the wall, trying to reload her already loaded bolter. Augusta put a hand on her arm. ‘Stop. The weapon is ready. It holds the faith of our Order and its own strength. Remember to pray, Melia, the Litany of Truth. It will clear your mind of the darkness.’ Melia said, her voice shaking, ‘Ego veritatem tuam.’ ‘We must go on. Cleanse the core of this place.’ Do you not know where you are? A curl of fear was growing in Augusta’s heart. She knew that they should check every tunnel, that they should ensure their exit route, and not leave the possibility of enemies at their backs. But she also knew that they could not let Subul get too far ahead of them. And her instinct told her to head down, always down, that the thing they sought lurked somewhere in the catacombs’ bowels. And that they needed to reach it before Subul assaulted them again, and its power grew. At last they came through the final skull-framed archway and turned down a wider, stone tunnel that was precarious with its sharp descent. Here, the moss was even thicker. It made their footing soft and slippery, and it filled the air with spores that seemed to hover like insects. It also interfered with their preysight, and further confused the auspex in Caia’s hand. But still, they headed steadily down. Side exits became smaller and more uneven, and many led upwards, back towards the light; tiny rooms offered stone beds that indicated cells, these ones empty of devices. At some point, people had lived down here. But those people were long gone – now, there was only the darkness. And the more they progressed, the more Augusta could feel it, that hot, close pressure that seemed to condense in her chest, making her breathing thick and heavy. She began to recite the Litany of Mettle, feeling the others steady as she did so. They moved on, Jatoya’s quiet strength at their head. As they advanced, the hot wind became stronger, blowing in their faces from something ahead of them. From the place, Augusta was sure, where the daemon would be manifest. But when they reached the end of the tunnel, even the Sister Superior stopped to draw in a breath. The tunnel opened out onto a walkway, a flat and narrow span of stone that crossed a chamber like some vast and bottomless pit. Jatoya had paused in the cover of the tunnel-mouth – her flamer was a shorter-range weapon and of little use unless they were attacked upon the bridge. Augusta came forwards to look out over the drop. Beside the bridge and stretching down into the darkness were eight titanic, carved figures, hundreds of yards tall. They bore masks with gruesome, tooth-filled grins, carried blades or great whips in iron and brass and volcanic stone. And at their feet, somewhere far below, there was the faintest glimmer of flame. Augusta’s certainty was absolute – the Emperor had guided them. This was exactly where they were meant to be. ‘We will find a way down,’ Augusta said. ‘Caia?’ ‘Subul has turned away from the main passage, and is still ahead of us.’ She indicated the last of the side-tunnels, a maw into darkness. ‘If we want to keep him in range, we’ll need to follow him, and swiftly.’ ‘There is corruption below us,’ Augusta said. ‘I can hear it, feel it. We must face it.’ ‘Is the bridge secure?’ Jatoya asked. ‘The density of the stone is unchanging, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘The bridge is secure.’ ‘Good,’ she said. ‘Sister Superior – what is your decision? Do we pursue Subul, or do we cross?’ Augusta came to the very edge of the tunnel and looked out over the drop, her belly lurching. The floor was too far to see, but the flashes of firelight were unmistakeable. ‘We cross by twos,’ she said. ‘Jatoya, Caia, you first, and secure the far side. The rest of you, watch and give covering fire. If anything moves, shoot it.’ ‘Aye,’ Jatoya said. She paused to eye the open expanse of the bridge. ‘On the double, Sister Caia. Ready?’ The two women timed themselves the count of three and then ran, tiny red figures in the expanse of the chamber, their black and white cloaks snapping behind them as they raced across. Caia slipped and Jatoya paused to steady her companion, but they reached the far side without mishap. ‘Melia, Akemi.’ Two more red figures ran. At the rear, Augusta glanced at Viola. She had left them until the last deliberately, and now she put her hand on the younger woman’s shoulder. Over a private vox-channel, she said, ‘Steady, Viola. You are strong, and you’ve come a long way from the young woman who shot the ork warlord.’ Viola said only, ‘Aye.’ She seemed to think about it for a moment, then added, ‘I wish this were that simple.’ Augusta chuckled, the sound one of long years of battle experience. ‘One thing the God-Emperor teaches,’ she said, ‘is that no two fights, no two foes, are ever the same. Trust in His wisdom and remain strong.’ Viola nodded, looked as though she was about to say something further, but a cry across the vox made them both look up and across the chasm. ‘Sister!’ The voice was Jatoya. ‘You need to bear witness!’ Augusta gave Viola’s shoulder a brief, tight grip, then let her go. And they ran. Augusta was not wild about heights. She wasn’t afraid of them, exactly, but they made her queasy to the pit of her stomach – of all the tests of her faith, drop-pod missions were about her least favoured. But, as ever, she pushed the nausea aside – she could not indulge such things. As she ran, though, she was still painfully aware that they had no cover, and that if anything shot at them, there would be nothing they could do – even if a bullet did not penetrate their armour, the impact would be enough to make them fall. Down, down into the depths… They reached the far side safely. As they crossed once more into the security of the surrounding stone, Caia was there to meet them, her injured arm cradled to her, her breathing harsh. ‘We found the others.’ Her voice caught. ‘But Felicity…’ The weight of the sentence was enough. Augusta pushed past her and into the last room, the final room of the complex that was not the lurking pit below. ‘By the Light!’ Dropping to her knees, she touched the front of her armour, her heart in her mouth. Another mockery, another taunt. In here lay the remains of Sister Felicity’s squad – ­shattered armour, rotting and dismembered limbs. They had been arranged in a pattern, deliberate, some ghoulish mockery or design, and five flayed skulls sat in a pile in the centre, all of them covered in blood. Five. Not six. Felicity herself was still missing. Viola had stayed by the exit and was still watching the bridge. The rest of the squad joined the Sister Superior, kneeling to the members of their Order, now lost to the darkness. ‘Blessed be their memories.’ They stayed like that for a long moment, repeating the prayer. Then Melia pulled a small candle from her kit and placed it upon the floor, lighting it with a prayer of her own. ‘We will not let this pass,’ Melia said. She, too, was beginning to sound angry. ‘We will finish this.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta told her. ‘We will. And then we will place the monster’s head upon the altar of the cathedral itself.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT Akemi knew it was there – she could feel it. Like the choking density of the town’s air, she could feel the presence of Chaos, feel it whispering in the back of her mind. It knew they were coming; it wanted them. It hungered for their company and for the blood-games that would follow. And they would scream before it was over. The thought of it pulled her breath from her lungs. Sister Akemi had never doubted the change in her calling, the shift from her novitiate classes in scriptology and linguistics to the lessons of bolter and blade. It had been a matter of faith, and unquestioned. But this was her first real mission, the first time she had ever left the quiet security of the Convent Sanctorum for longer than her Trials of Ordination. And here she was, descending the last of the circling stone steps to the very bottom of the pit – the dark hole in Lautis’ heart. She was a warrior of the Order, and she knew she should not be afraid. But she could not help it. ‘Tenebris,’ Augusta said softly. The Sisters’ suitlights went out. In the sudden plunge of darkness, the walls offered a familiar glow. The same eerie green gleam that had lined the town lurked also down here, jagged patterns that glittered like veins, calling them onwards. Akemi felt the shift in angle that was the bottom of the steps. And a voice in the blackness spoke to them. ‘Ah, my Sisters. So at last you have come.’ With a boom like the command of a general, it said, ‘Let there be light.’ A rush of flame flared round the walls. The protections in her visor prevented her from blinking, but Akemi took a step back, almost unable to stop herself from crying out. Now, conjured to hot and flickering life, a huge firepit occupied the centre of the floor. It was piled high with skulls, the ones at the top recent, the last of their flesh now burning, the ones at the bottom so old that they were all but dust. Brass spikes ran around its outside, all pointing inwards and downwards – anything that was cast into that hole would have no way to escape. The thought of it made her shudder. But that was only the beginning. Around it, the bases of the eight stone statues stood like monstrous pillars, their dancing shadows cast upon the walls behind. Before them, sconces stood in the stone, all of them bright with a rich, blood-red fire. And everywhere, the carvings ran with the blood from the pool above, the red seeping into the green. The ancient figures seemed to glint with hunger and glee. But even that was not what made Akemi stop. Before the pit itself stood three creatures, each one horned and scarlet-skinned. Their legs were back-bent, their arms heavily muscled, ending in outstretched hands and the talons of a predator. They made her heart shake in her chest – the fire and blood-walls limned them in power, in a slavering rage of cruelty. They reminded her strangely of the hounds, and she did not need Augusta to tell her that these were their masters, the leaders of their hunt. Each one carried a blade that shone with the same, unholy glare. Like a splinter of Chaos itself. The voice said, ‘Welcome, Augusta. Your martial reputation precedes you – you are a true warrior of your Order.’ Its laugh rolled from the walls. ‘Now,’ it said. ‘Show me.’ Long tongues extending, the things licked their teeth. ‘Move!’ Augusta barked the order. ‘On the double. Let’s give ourselves some range, an open field of fire. We don’t want these things close!’ Skidding, her hand gripping her bolter and her boots going from under her, Akemi ran. Somewhere, something in her heart wanted to just keep running – to flee this place, flee this horror. Flee the writhing, shimmering colours of these creatures’ eyes and swords… Confidunt in Eo, Akemi. She believed. Augusta was still shouting. ‘That statue – that one – put it at our backs!’ But behind them, the creatures, too, had broken into a run. They were faster than Akemi had expected; they covered the ground so quickly that she barely had time to reach the statue, then turn to raise both bolter and litany like the twin flags of her faith. But the incoming creatures didn’t care – they slowed down and bared their teeth at the Sisters, as if sneering. The squad fired and wounds appeared in the beasts’ chests and shoulders, mists of blood and steam pouring from their skin. They did not stop. They came on like a promise – like they would tear the Sisters’ hearts out and cast their skulls into the pit. In response, Augusta’s shout came over the vox. ‘Viola! Fire!’ ‘From the begetting of daemons!’ With a shout of defiance, Viola loosed the full power of the thrice-blessed heavy bolter. The creatures juddered under the full suppression; they shook and they staggered, but that was all. Furious, Viola kept firing, kept singing the litany so the words, too, would drive the creatures back. One took a round in the leg, blowing it apart. It faltered and fell, hissing at them, daring them to go closer. ‘Leave it,’ Augusta barked. ‘Viola, concentrate your fire, one target at a time. The one on the left!’ ‘But, Sister! I can kill–!’ ‘Follow the order!’ Flinching at Augusta’s tone, Viola switched targets, letting the left-hand creature take the full force of the weapon. The things were getting close now, and Akemi wanted desperately to quail away from them. She could feel the tension in her throat rising – she wanted to scream to release the pressure. She kept singing. Augusta shouted, ‘The rest of you, take out the injured one!’ Gunfire and harmonies rang from the rock. Akemi resumed shooting, trying to hit the injured creature’s weak points – its joints, its eyes. Beside her, Caia shot with her uninjured hand, holding her auspex in the other. The wound in her elbow was swollen, and the auspex flickered and flared. She cursed the thing, slung it back on her belt, and concentrated fully on the bolter. But the closest creature was almost on them now. Eyes burning brighter than the fire, it raised the blade as if to cut them down. Panicked, Akemi felt a powerful urge to switch targets, to shoot it before it could reach them, but she knew she had to follow her orders, focus… With a rasp, Augusta started her chainsword and stepped out to meet it. Over the vox, the litany came from her in a low, angry rumble – like a threat of incoming thunder. Akemi had admired Augusta’s steel resolve, her unwavering faith, her utter fearlessness – but this… to stand blade to blade against this creature of Ruin, against such ferocity and rage… The creature paused. It splayed its talons and bared its teeth; its tongue curled and rolled. The sword in its hand glowed like red hell; as Augusta brought her own blade up to cut the thing open from hip to shoulder, it parried, and hard. Sparks sizzled on the stone. ‘Akemi!’ The command was Jatoya, and it made Akemi jump. She raised her pistol once more. Beside her, Viola had the heavy bolter braced against her shoulder. Her target creature was moving through a mist of its own blood, still taking round after round – it had slowed under the onslaught, but that was all. And Viola’s anger was as high as Augusta’s, raging completely and without limit. The litany roared from her, and Akemi could feel it – the surge of it in her heart and her soul, the pure zeal of the Sisters’ rage. She found herself joining the shout, both furious and praising, as if daring the fear to come back. She shot, and shot again. The injured creature snarled at her. Struggling to stand, it looked up and met her eyes. And then, suddenly, she couldn’t see – only the darkness, only the brass hooks, embedded in her skin, only the seething writhe of Chaos. She cried out, unable to help it – her shouts torn down like a dropped banner. The flash was too strong, overwhelming– Jatoya’s gauntlet struck the side of her face – not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to make her jump. ‘Your orders were to keep firing!’ ‘Aye!’ She aimed her bolter at the thing’s other knee and pulled the trigger. She saw the round strike its flesh – blow the back of the joint clean out of its leg. It stumbled further and spat in pain; a drool of saliva ran from its teeth. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Akemi found the litany coming from her mouth in celebration, now, in harmony to the thundering rage of her Sisters. Facing the daemon, her courage and anger were annealing, fusing suddenly into something new and bright. It felt like a forging of her faith into a new weapon, a new light. She was a Sister of the Bloody Rose, a follower of Saint Mina, a Daughter of the Emperor, and this was why she’d been called. Beside her, Viola was still shouting, still shooting; smoke was starting to come from the heavy bolter. But Viola’s aim was good; she dropped into a kneel, leaned back, braced the weapon against her shoulder… Akemi saw the weapon start to overheat, saw the rounds hit the thing clean in the face. And she saw the daemon finally waver – too much damage, too many wounds. It staggered to its knees, then toppled, twisting in the air in the same way that the hounds had done, becoming a spiral of detonating blackness. And then it was gone, and the red mist was all that was left. Smooth and swift, Viola turned the smoking bolter on Akemi’s injured creature and blew its head clean from its shoulders. Another detonation, and it, too, was gone. Akemi wanted to raise a prayer of thanks, or relief – but the fight was not over. There were still two struggling figures, silhouettes against the firepit. To one side of them, the last of the creatures was circling the Sister Superior, swift and light on its feet, and grinning through razor-sharp teeth. As Akemi watched, Augusta spun her blade one-handed and struck at it, once, twice. And each time, the creature’s blood-shining sword parried the blow with a harsh, metallic crash. The chainsword scraped and grated. Sparks flew. Over the vox, Jatoya said, ‘Remember Hephaestus?’ Puzzled, Akemi glanced at the others. No one moved. Only Jatoya. As Augusta shifted, forcing the daemon to turn to face her and expose its back to the Sisters, the second-in-command dropped one shoulder and broke into a run. She hit the creature full-on. It tried to keep its feet, failed. And as it hit the floor, Augusta stepped forwards and took its head straight off its shoulders. The resulting detonation covered both women in gore – but it, too, had gone. The chamber was silent. Nothing moved. Only the running teeth of the chainsword. Only the dancing crackle of the flames. And then, the voice began to laugh. Rich and deep and dark, the laughter came from all around them. Akemi could not see the owner of the sound, but she realised that the creatures they’d faced were just more minions. There was something else down here. Something bigger. ‘Impressive,’ said a voice. ‘A display like that is almost worthy of a Champion of Khorne.’ ‘Coward!’ Augusta shouted the word to the stone. ‘Come out and face me yourself!’ The laughter twisted, the sound harsh and unpleasant – whatever it was, she’d made it angry. It snarled, its voice now layered with many tones. ‘Stay your tongue, wench. I’ll deal with you soon enough.’ Muttering over the vox, Jatoya commented bleakly, ‘Wench, is it? I’ll pull out its lungs and make it eat them.’ Augusta made no comment. Instead, she shouted, ‘I’ve cut down your hounds, creature, your bloodletters, your cultists. What else can you bring me?’ ‘Very well.’ It sounded amused. ‘I think you’ve earned your boon.’ With a rumble, the wall before them came down. Akemi was on the floor, scrabbling frantically away, her mind shrieking something that might have been a prayer. The thing filled her vision, her head, her thoughts. It choked her with the reek of blood and death; it kicked its way through the rubble as if the rock were nothing but sand, and it paused on the far side of the fire. She had understood that these beasts existed, but had never believed, never even begun to imagine, what that could actually mean. The thing was almost as tall as the chamber, its matted and filthy fur clad in brass that flashed in the firelight. Great wings framed it in darkness and power. In one hand, it bore an axe, the notched blade longer than Akemi was tall. In the other, it bore a huge, brass-spiked whip. It lashed the thongs around its head, the harsh noise snapping from the walls. Akemi was dimly aware that the rest of the squad had fallen back, that the hymnal had faded from the air. Her mind screamed only terror and absolute, utter incomprehension. And then she heard a voice. Augusta’s voice. ‘Et Imperatoris nomen, non vereor vobis.’ In the Emperor’s name, I do not fear you. Her tiny, armoured figure silhouetted by the monster, the Sister Superior had stood her ground. Unflinching, she took up the hymnal once more, her words cold and strong. They came over the vox like a blessing, and Akemi realised that she’d fallen. Ashamed of herself, she scrabbled upright, her bolter still in her hand. Other voices were joining the recitation, now; she raised her own, striving to remember her electric rush of faith from before. But the monster only laughed at them. The noise seemed to come from all around it, from out of the very rock. ‘Are you Mina, little girl? I think not. Greater warriors than you have faced this death, Augusta,’ the voice said. ‘Greater swordswomen than you have failed. They faltered, and they fell, and they begged for their lives.’ It hissed at her, mocking. ‘And they were drained, blood and soul, and their skulls cast upon the flames. And now, Augusta Santorus, you think yourself the equal of your betters? You will die screaming.’ Beside Akemi, Viola was still on her knees. She was reciting the hymnal like a woman demented, the same words, over and over and over. She seemed to be fiddling with something held across her lap. As Akemi leaned to see, she saw that she was reloading the heavy bolter with shaking gauntlets. Jatoya had moved to stand at Augusta’s shoulder, another silhouette against the enormity and the flame. Caia and Melia were further away, but back on their feet. They faced the thing together, weapons in hands. The daemon took a step forwards, and the whole chamber shook. It leaned down, teeth bared, its spread horns almost as wide as the firepit, and said, ‘Look at you, Augusta. At your bloodlust, at your fury, at your red armour all soaked in gore. Are you not just like us, Sister Superior? Are you, too, not a creature of warfare and death?’ She said, her voice flat, ‘I fight by the Will of the Emperor, and by His command–’ It laughed again, blasphemous and scornful. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ Still reciting the hymnal, Augusta didn’t move. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death…’ The creature exhaled, a hiss of spittle and flame. ‘You still do not understand, little one. Did you not come here seeking truth? Seeking artefacts and icons? The building above us, that you so revere, was indeed raised in the name of your Saint. It is her statues that you have seen. It has shed blood in her name. Blood, to punish the heretic, blood to convert the unbeliever, blood for those who failed your Emperor, blood for those who did not bend their knee quite fast enough…’ ‘That Thou shouldst spare none…’ ‘But she did not build it, Augusta, nor did her followers.’ It paused, almost grinning. ‘We did. We have used her name to further the ancient powers of this place – we have made sure that every sacrifice made in the Emperor’s name fed us, kept us, strengthened us. That every act made in the name of your Saint has been what you would term a “blasphemy”. And for thousands of years.’ It was celebrating now, exultant in rage and power. ‘We hold a vial of Mina’s own blood here, taken from her last stand upon Hydraphur. That is the artefact that you first came here seeking. Do you want it?’ ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none…’ ‘We are the same, you and I. Linked by blood. Celebrate your skills, Augusta. Rejoice in them! Set yourself free from the bondage of your foolish faith!’ ‘We beseech Thee…’ ‘Stubborn as ever.’ The daemon sneered, scornful and angry. ‘…Destroy them.’ ‘So be it,’ the creature said. It raised the whip. Listening to the daemon, Akemi had realised something else. It had taken her a moment – in the first shock of terror, she had not known what was happening, but now her mind was back at the schola. She could see her old tutor, the text on the data-slate; she was scrambling after old information, after a half-forgotten novitiate class, so many years before. She faced the daemon, trying not to blink, watching its mouth as it spoke… Or didn’t. Its teeth were as long as chainswords, but that was not what she was looking for. She was having the oddest sensation that the daemon itself was not speaking. That its voice was coming from somewhere else. She found herself scrabbling to remember – something. There was a piece of information that she needed, that she knew she had… …but the daemon was filling her head. Akemi clung to the words of the hymnal, and tried to clear her thoughts. The whip coiled and snapped again, the sound sharp and harsh. Remember, I must remember… Emperor, help me, help me clear my mind… She was staring at the symbol on the beast’s armour, the symbol of the Blood God, the same one that had been engraved in the skin of Subul’s forehead… Augusta said, quite clearly, ‘…destroy them.’ ‘So be it.’ The beast stood upright, its bass laughter thundering like a rockfall. But yes, Akemi realised, she had been right – it was not the beast that was laughing. Its huge fangs were bared, but the laughter was not coming out of its mouth– And then, the memory hit her like the long ruler of her one-time novitiate tutor… ‘Sister!’ She shouted out loud and over the vox, desperate to make Augusta hear her. ‘Sister! I think… I think we may have a chance!’",

They made her heart shake in her chest – the fire and blood-walls limned them in power, in a slavering rage of cruelty. They reminded her strangely of the hounds, and she did not need Augusta to tell her that these were their masters, the leaders of their hunt. Each one carried a blade that shone with the same, unholy glare. Like a splinter of Chaos itself. The voice said, ‘Welcome, Augusta. Your martial reputation precedes you – you are a true warrior of your Order.’ Its laugh rolled from the walls. ‘Now,’ it said. ‘Show me.’ Long tongues extending, the things licked their teeth. ‘Move!’ Augusta barked the order. ‘On the double. Let’s give ourselves some range, an open field of fire. We don’t want these things close!’ Skidding, her hand gripping her bolter and her boots going from under her, Akemi ran. Somewhere, something in her heart wanted to just keep running – to flee this place, flee this horror. Flee the writhing, shimmering colours of these creatures’ eyes and swords… Confidunt in Eo, Akemi. She believed. Augusta was still shouting. ‘That statue – that one – put it at our backs!’ But behind them, the creatures, too, had broken into a run. They were faster than Akemi had expected; they covered the ground so quickly that she barely had time to reach the statue, then turn to raise both bolter and litany like the twin flags of her faith. But the incoming creatures didn’t care – they slowed down and bared their teeth at the Sisters, as if sneering. The squad fired and wounds appeared in the beasts’ chests and shoulders, mists of blood and steam pouring from their skin. They did not stop. They came on like a promise – like they would tear the Sisters’ hearts out and cast their skulls into the pit. In response, Augusta’s shout came over the vox. ‘Viola! Fire!’ ‘From the begetting of daemons!’ With a shout of defiance, Viola loosed the full power of the thrice-blessed heavy bolter. The creatures juddered under the full suppression; they shook and they staggered, but that was all. Furious, Viola kept firing, kept singing the litany so the words, too, would drive the creatures back. One took a round in the leg, blowing it apart. It faltered and fell, hissing at them, daring them to go closer. ‘Leave it,’ Augusta barked. ‘Viola, concentrate your fire, one target at a time. The one on the left!’ ‘But, Sister! I can kill–!’ ‘Follow the order!’ Flinching at Augusta’s tone, Viola switched targets, letting the left-hand creature take the full force of the weapon. The things were getting close now, and Akemi wanted desperately to quail away from them. She could feel the tension in her throat rising – she wanted to scream to release the pressure. She kept singing. Augusta shouted, ‘The rest of you, take out the injured one!’ Gunfire and harmonies rang from the rock. Akemi resumed shooting, trying to hit the injured creature’s weak points – its joints, its eyes. Beside her, Caia shot with her uninjured hand, holding her auspex in the other. The wound in her elbow was swollen, and the auspex flickered and flared. She cursed the thing, slung it back on her belt, and concentrated fully on the bolter. But the closest creature was almost on them now. Eyes burning brighter than the fire, it raised the blade as if to cut them down. Panicked, Akemi felt a powerful urge to switch targets, to shoot it before it could reach them, but she knew she had to follow her orders, focus… With a rasp, Augusta started her chainsword and stepped out to meet it. Over the vox, the litany came from her in a low, angry rumble – like a threat of incoming thunder. Akemi had admired Augusta’s steel resolve, her unwavering faith, her utter fearlessness – but this… to stand blade to blade against this creature of Ruin, against such ferocity and rage… The creature paused. It splayed its talons and bared its teeth; its tongue curled and rolled. The sword in its hand glowed like red hell; as Augusta brought her own blade up to cut the thing open from hip to shoulder, it parried, and hard. Sparks sizzled on the stone. ‘Akemi!’ The command was Jatoya, and it made Akemi jump. She raised her pistol once more. Beside her, Viola had the heavy bolter braced against her shoulder. Her target creature was moving through a mist of its own blood, still taking round after round – it had slowed under the onslaught, but that was all. And Viola’s anger was as high as Augusta’s, raging completely and without limit. The litany roared from her, and Akemi could feel it – the surge of it in her heart and her soul, the pure zeal of the Sisters’ rage. She found herself joining the shout, both furious and praising, as if daring the fear to come back. She shot, and shot again. The injured creature snarled at her. Struggling to stand, it looked up and met her eyes. And then, suddenly, she couldn’t see – only the darkness, only the brass hooks, embedded in her skin, only the seething writhe of Chaos. She cried out, unable to help it – her shouts torn down like a dropped banner. The flash was too strong, overwhelming– Jatoya’s gauntlet struck the side of her face – not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to make her jump. ‘Your orders were to keep firing!’ ‘Aye!’ She aimed her bolter at the thing’s other knee and pulled the trigger. She saw the round strike its flesh – blow the back of the joint clean out of its leg. It stumbled further and spat in pain; a drool of saliva ran from its teeth. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ Akemi found the litany coming from her mouth in celebration, now, in harmony to the thundering rage of her Sisters. Facing the daemon, her courage and anger were annealing, fusing suddenly into something new and bright. It felt like a forging of her faith into a new weapon, a new light. She was a Sister of the Bloody Rose, a follower of Saint Mina, a Daughter of the Emperor, and this was why she’d been called. Beside her, Viola was still shouting, still shooting; smoke was starting to come from the heavy bolter. But Viola’s aim was good; she dropped into a kneel, leaned back, braced the weapon against her shoulder… Akemi saw the weapon start to overheat, saw the rounds hit the thing clean in the face. And she saw the daemon finally waver – too much damage, too many wounds. It staggered to its knees, then toppled, twisting in the air in the same way that the hounds had done, becoming a spiral of detonating blackness. And then it was gone, and the red mist was all that was left. Smooth and swift, Viola turned the smoking bolter on Akemi’s injured creature and blew its head clean from its shoulders. Another detonation, and it, too, was gone. Akemi wanted to raise a prayer of thanks, or relief – but the fight was not over. There were still two struggling figures, silhouettes against the firepit. To one side of them, the last of the creatures was circling the Sister Superior, swift and light on its feet, and grinning through razor-sharp teeth. As Akemi watched, Augusta spun her blade one-handed and struck at it, once, twice. And each time, the creature’s blood-shining sword parried the blow with a harsh, metallic crash. The chainsword scraped and grated. Sparks flew. Over the vox, Jatoya said, ‘Remember Hephaestus?’ Puzzled, Akemi glanced at the others. No one moved. Only Jatoya. As Augusta shifted, forcing the daemon to turn to face her and expose its back to the Sisters, the second-in-command dropped one shoulder and broke into a run. She hit the creature full-on. It tried to keep its feet, failed. And as it hit the floor, Augusta stepped forwards and took its head straight off its shoulders. The resulting detonation covered both women in gore – but it, too, had gone. The chamber was silent. Nothing moved. Only the running teeth of the chainsword. Only the dancing crackle of the flames. And then, the voice began to laugh. Rich and deep and dark, the laughter came from all around them. Akemi could not see the owner of the sound, but she realised that the creatures they’d faced were just more minions. There was something else down here. Something bigger. ‘Impressive,’ said a voice. ‘A display like that is almost worthy of a Champion of Khorne.’ ‘Coward!’ Augusta shouted the word to the stone. ‘Come out and face me yourself!’ The laughter twisted, the sound harsh and unpleasant – whatever it was, she’d made it angry. It snarled, its voice now layered with many tones. ‘Stay your tongue, wench. I’ll deal with you soon enough.’ Muttering over the vox, Jatoya commented bleakly, ‘Wench, is it? I’ll pull out its lungs and make it eat them.’ Augusta made no comment. Instead, she shouted, ‘I’ve cut down your hounds, creature, your bloodletters, your cultists. What else can you bring me?’ ‘Very well.’ It sounded amused. ‘I think you’ve earned your boon.’ With a rumble, the wall before them came down. Akemi was on the floor, scrabbling frantically away, her mind shrieking something that might have been a prayer. The thing filled her vision, her head, her thoughts. It choked her with the reek of blood and death; it kicked its way through the rubble as if the rock were nothing but sand, and it paused on the far side of the fire. She had understood that these beasts existed, but had never believed, never even begun to imagine, what that could actually mean. The thing was almost as tall as the chamber, its matted and filthy fur clad in brass that flashed in the firelight. Great wings framed it in darkness and power. In one hand, it bore an axe, the notched blade longer than Akemi was tall. In the other, it bore a huge, brass-spiked whip. It lashed the thongs around its head, the harsh noise snapping from the walls. Akemi was dimly aware that the rest of the squad had fallen back, that the hymnal had faded from the air. Her mind screamed only terror and absolute, utter incomprehension. And then she heard a voice. Augusta’s voice. ‘Et Imperatoris nomen, non vereor vobis.’ In the Emperor’s name, I do not fear you. Her tiny, armoured figure silhouetted by the monster, the Sister Superior had stood her ground. Unflinching, she took up the hymnal once more, her words cold and strong. They came over the vox like a blessing, and Akemi realised that she’d fallen. Ashamed of herself, she scrabbled upright, her bolter still in her hand. Other voices were joining the recitation, now; she raised her own, striving to remember her electric rush of faith from before. But the monster only laughed at them. The noise seemed to come from all around it, from out of the very rock. ‘Are you Mina, little girl? I think not. Greater warriors than you have faced this death, Augusta,’ the voice said. ‘Greater swordswomen than you have failed. They faltered, and they fell, and they begged for their lives.’ It hissed at her, mocking. ‘And they were drained, blood and soul, and their skulls cast upon the flames. And now, Augusta Santorus, you think yourself the equal of your betters? You will die screaming.’ Beside Akemi, Viola was still on her knees. She was reciting the hymnal like a woman demented, the same words, over and over and over. She seemed to be fiddling with something held across her lap. As Akemi leaned to see, she saw that she was reloading the heavy bolter with shaking gauntlets. Jatoya had moved to stand at Augusta’s shoulder, another silhouette against the enormity and the flame. Caia and Melia were further away, but back on their feet. They faced the thing together, weapons in hands. The daemon took a step forwards, and the whole chamber shook. It leaned down, teeth bared, its spread horns almost as wide as the firepit, and said, ‘Look at you, Augusta. At your bloodlust, at your fury, at your red armour all soaked in gore. Are you not just like us, Sister Superior? Are you, too, not a creature of warfare and death?’ She said, her voice flat, ‘I fight by the Will of the Emperor, and by His command–’ It laughed again, blasphemous and scornful. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ Still reciting the hymnal, Augusta didn’t move. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death…’ The creature exhaled, a hiss of spittle and flame. ‘You still do not understand, little one. Did you not come here seeking truth? Seeking artefacts and icons? The building above us, that you so revere, was indeed raised in the name of your Saint. It is her statues that you have seen. It has shed blood in her name. Blood, to punish the heretic, blood to convert the unbeliever, blood for those who failed your Emperor, blood for those who did not bend their knee quite fast enough…’ ‘That Thou shouldst spare none…’ ‘But she did not build it, Augusta, nor did her followers.’ It paused, almost grinning. ‘We did. We have used her name to further the ancient powers of this place – we have made sure that every sacrifice made in the Emperor’s name fed us, kept us, strengthened us. That every act made in the name of your Saint has been what you would term a “blasphemy”. And for thousands of years.’ It was celebrating now, exultant in rage and power. ‘We hold a vial of Mina’s own blood here, taken from her last stand upon Hydraphur. That is the artefact that you first came here seeking. Do you want it?’ ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none…’ ‘We are the same, you and I. Linked by blood. Celebrate your skills, Augusta. Rejoice in them! Set yourself free from the bondage of your foolish faith!’ ‘We beseech Thee…’ ‘Stubborn as ever.’ The daemon sneered, scornful and angry. ‘…Destroy them.’ ‘So be it,’ the creature said. It raised the whip. Listening to the daemon, Akemi had realised something else. It had taken her a moment – in the first shock of terror, she had not known what was happening, but now her mind was back at the schola. She could see her old tutor, the text on the data-slate; she was scrambling after old information, after a half-forgotten novitiate class, so many years before. She faced the daemon, trying not to blink, watching its mouth as it spoke… Or didn’t. Its teeth were as long as chainswords, but that was not what she was looking for. She was having the oddest sensation that the daemon itself was not speaking. That its voice was coming from somewhere else. She found herself scrabbling to remember – something. There was a piece of information that she needed, that she knew she had… …but the daemon was filling her head. Akemi clung to the words of the hymnal, and tried to clear her thoughts. The whip coiled and snapped again, the sound sharp and harsh. Remember, I must remember… Emperor, help me, help me clear my mind… She was staring at the symbol on the beast’s armour, the symbol of the Blood God, the same one that had been engraved in the skin of Subul’s forehead… Augusta said, quite clearly, ‘…destroy them.’ ‘So be it.’ The beast stood upright, its bass laughter thundering like a rockfall. But yes, Akemi realised, she had been right – it was not the beast that was laughing. Its huge fangs were bared, but the laughter was not coming out of its mouth– And then, the memory hit her like the long ruler of her one-time novitiate tutor… ‘Sister!’ She shouted out loud and over the vox, desperate to make Augusta hear her. ‘Sister! I think… I think we may have a chance!’",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Watching the monster, Augusta listened to Akemi’s frantic outline, her memory of her lesson from the schola. The Sister Superior had faced daemons before, and she knew the truth of what Akemi was saying. ‘Sister Akemi, you are truly blessed with wisdom.’ Augusta inhaled, made her decision, gave her orders, soft and urgent. ‘Go. Take the others with you. Find him. Jatoya, stay with me.’ ‘I would not be anywhere else,’ Jatoya said. The touch of her second’s strength and friendship was powerful, a touch of faith in the clamouring dark. She heard the others scrabble as they crossed the cavern floor. The colossal might of the daemon laughed ever harder. ‘So you flee, little Sisters? So much for your devotion.’ ‘We have devotion, daemon!’ The voice was Viola’s. A flash of pure adrenaline shot through Augusta’s nerves. ‘Viola.’ Her words over the vox were swift and quiet. ‘Follow your orders.’ She didn’t turn, couldn’t take her attention from the titanic, looming height of the monster, but she could still hear the bootsteps as the younger Sister walked across the floor of the cavern. ‘I am a Daughter of the Emperor,’ Viola called. ‘A Sister of the Bloody Rose. A follower of Saint Mina. And I do not fear you, daemon, any more than I fear orks, or any other denizen of the darkness! I defy you!’ Her voice was shaking with outrage – but Augusta could hear the truth of it. Viola’s boldness was pure swagger; under the pressure of the daemon’s presence, she had a need to prove herself worthy, to live up to the thrice-blessed weapon that she bore. ‘And I will send you back!’ ‘Viola!’ The Sister Superior’s bark was stronger, this time. ‘Follow your orders!’ But Viola did not reply – she may even have turned off her vox. She came forwards into Augusta’s peripheral vision, an upright figure in blood-soaked scarlet, her cloak blackened by flames, her single merit-bead flickering in the firelight. The heavy bolter was raised, nestled against her shoulder. ‘Child,’ the daemon said. Its voice was soaked in scorn. ‘I will peel every inch of skin from your body.’ ‘Try it,’ Jatoya muttered. Whether it heard her or not, it raised the whip, curling its thongs upwards and over its head. Augusta knew that one lash from that weapon would break Viola in half, armour and all. But as it came down, Jatoya was already moving. Akemi scrambled across the floor of the cavern, away from the monster and the firelight and towards the bottom of the staircase. Words tumbled from her as she ran. ‘Subul,’ she said. ‘We need to find him. And fast.’ The others followed her as ordered, their confusion not voiced aloud. She replied to it anyway. ‘Think about it,’ she said. ‘There has been so much bloodshed here, and for thousands of years – from the Age of Strife, and in the cathedral’s valetudinarium… Sister Jatoya was right – the blood-worship is soaked into the very stone here.’ ‘What about the town?’ Caia asked. ‘They embraced the Emperor, welcomed the return to their faith of the Great Crusade…’ ‘Many embraced the Emperor, certainly,’ Melia said. ‘But the darkness has always been here, twisting and lying and deceiving. This whole world is a battleground.’ ‘Then we will win that battle,’ Caia said, simply. ‘Once and for all.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Kawa tried to fight,’ Akemi said, still thinking aloud. ‘Maybe Subul used her death as a summoning ritual, maybe the summoning itself was accidental – just too much bloodshed – I don’t know. But…’ she paused, turned round, ‘Subul bears the mark of Khorne, and if we can find him…’ ‘We will banish the daemon?’ ‘We will banish the daemon.’ Caia had her flickering auspex in her hand and was trying to understand the endless tangles of tunnels, the erratic distant blips of motion. They raced back up the long curve of the steps to the last side passage, and the direction that Subul had taken. But Caia shook her head. ‘The signal’s gone. This place is like a nightmare. How do we find him in all this?’ Akemi controlled her rising impatience, resisted the urge to grab the auspex and look for herself. Then Melia pointed, ‘There.’ On the stone ahead of them: a tiny smear of red. ‘Quietly, Sisters,’ she said. ‘Let us take this carefully and not let him know we’re coming.’ Akemi wanted to point out that they didn’t have time to spare – but she also didn’t want to doubt the strength and faith of the Sisters now below them. Then Caia suddenly said, ‘Where’s Viola?’ The crack of the whip sent a sharp detonation through the air. The stone shook. Augusta did not move. She saw Jatoya slam Viola clean in the belly, taking the younger Sister off her feet. The whip curled over Viola’s head just as the pair of them hit the ground. They rolled back upright in seconds. In defiance of her orders, Viola was again raising the bolter. Augusta would discipline her squad member later. Now, she bellowed, ‘To me, both of you!’ Both Sisters started to move, but the descending clang of the axeblade was too close, and it sent them sprawling. Snarling, the daemon raised the weapon just enough to crush both of them where they lay– ‘Wait!’ Augusta stepped forwards, bellowing up at the thing. ‘You’ll face me, daemon, not them.’ ‘What are you doing?’ Jatoya asked. The squad’s second was pulling Viola to her feet, but the younger Sister was struggling to rise. She was chanting the same line of the litany, over and over again. From the begetting of daemons… the begetting of daemons… Augusta said, ‘Giving Akemi time.’ The daemon hissed through long, stained teeth. ‘Why? I could kill all of you with a flick, with a finger. I could hold you over the fire and flay you while you still lived.’ Because the error of this place was mine, and they should not pay for it… ‘You don’t fear me, do you?’ Her shout rang from the stone, mocking. ‘Do you fear to lose?’ Caught, the thing mantled its wings and hissed, stooping forwards to study her. Its head was bigger than she was, its eyes like pits of fire and death. As it came close, Augusta felt her throat close, her blood turn utterly cold. The screaming… The blood… The hooks… But she could also see a red Sabbat-pattern helmet, bloodied skull still within, that was hung about its neck like a trophy. It was the one that had been missing from the previous chamber. Felicity. And her anger came flooding back to her, her faith and her strength. ‘A morte perpetua. Domine, libra nos.’ The monster snarled. ‘You foolish women are all the same.’ Its breath was caustic, polluted. ‘So proud, so eager to die.’ ‘I will take you with me.’ That made it laugh again, a deep rumble like falling stone. It stood back upright and threw back its head… …but now, Augusta could see that Akemi had been right – the voice did not belong to the creature. ‘Your Sister said exactly the same thing,’ it said, but the words were posturing, empty. And hope unfurled like a flag in her chest. Three scarlet figures slunk along the edge of the wall. They had no need for the auspex; they could hear the movement, now, hear the voices from ahead of them. Hear the many-layered bass boom that was Subul, the summoner. Akemi was beginning to understand that the daemon had always been here, that the blood shed down through the generations had called it back to the stone, again and again. And she could remember the stylised illustration in the schola’s manuscript – the cult leader with his symbol, his arms raised. They needed to find and slay him, and end this ordeal. Then they could return to the cathedral, and to the town, and they could begin their work anew. Or raze the building completely. The three Sisters turned the last corner of the tunnel. Ahead of them, there was light. It was the same rich, red light that came from the fire below – as if the flames themselves were somehow thick with blood. It had all come from here. The chamber was bright with flame – it had an open viewing port that allowed its occupants to see down into the pit. Down there, Augusta would face the daemon and she would try to give Akemi enough time… But Subul was not alone. One of the smaller creatures stood with him, flanking him like a guard, its hooves tamping restlessly on the rough stone floor. About its ankles curled another three of the red-skinned hounds. And Subul himself. He stood before an angled metal machine – a smaller thing, but a thing that looked exactly like the dead sculptures of the town. This one, however, was very much alive – and it defied her vision, its corners impossible, its edges bright with a hot, brass gleam. Writing writhed about it, seething in the air, and it contained an outline like some ancient mirror, a thing that roiled with mists of scarlet. It did not reflect the room, nor the figures within. Not a construction device, as Jencir had first guessed, but a portal. In its presence, Caia’s auspex flickered, guttered and burst into flame. With a startled curse, she dropped it. At the sound, the summoner turned around, the vortex in the mirror haloing him in pure, Chaotic power. Subul’s grin was unchanged, and the symbol on his head still ran scarlet with his own blood. The flow had blinded him completely, but his sightlessness was not a hindrance and he laughed the bass laugh of the daemon. ‘Ah,’ he said. ‘You are wise indeed, little Sisters.’ The hounds curled at his feet, bristling and snarling. ‘But you are not nearly strong enough. I can call forth endless foes, an army to walk over your corpses and to own this planet entire. And when your canoness comes – which she will – I can take her shuttles, and her ships. I can access the moon, and the fuel that it bears. And then, I can be freed from this rock.’ ‘So that’s it,’ Melia said. ‘You want the warships.’ ‘Your Mechanicus are easy bait, and your Order both warlike and prideful. You are simple to lead, and simple to slay. And this will be your ending, once and for all.’ His grin broadened, wider than his face. ‘Fitting, that Mina’s Order should make its last stand here, facing its oldest foes. And I… I will be free to leave. To carry the power of the Blood God across the galaxy!’ Melia made no response. She raised her bolter and pulled the trigger. But Subul was no longer there. Somehow, he’d slipped sideways and the round hit the flaming, churning, seething mass that was the centre of the mirror. The daemon hissed as if it were laughing. And the hounds leapt forwards. Down her long years of combat, there were many times that Augusta had been thankful for the care and attention she gave her armour, for the faith and training and discipline that kept her wargear immaculate. As the impossibly huge axeblade crashed to the floor just beside where she’d been standing, this was one of those times. The armour would not have stopped the blow, but it moved fluidly despite its weight, and it allowed her to dodge and roll. She came to her feet, blade still in hand, the Litany of Battle rumbling in her throat like a growl. But, defiance aside, she also had a solidly practical understanding of the might of the daemon – if that axe hit her, she would not get up again. And she had to give Akemi time. Facing the thing, she fought to banish its darkness from her mind, seeking a weak point, an advantage. She had better reactions, more manoeuvrability – yet its words had caught her, like a hook in her skin. Like your whole blood-armoured Order… This beast had slain Felicity. Dismembered her squad. Peeled the skin from Jencir’s skull and soaked the high altar in his life. In her head, she could hear the tech-priest, screaming like the Hephaestian miners… Snarling denial, she roared, ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ The whip-thongs circled and snapped over its head, the noise of them deafening. Brass spikes sparked with flame. But as the baffles in her vox-bead kicked in, she became aware of Jatoya’s deep voice, urgent words in her ear. She softened the litany to a whisper, fierce and quiet. ‘His hand has guided us, Sister. He has shown us the way.’ ‘What do you intend?’ Augusta said. ‘Quickly!’ She threw herself backwards as the whip snapped at her again, an inch from her gorget. The detonation of it almost made her stumble. ‘Viola!’ Jatoya barked the order. The roaring bark of the heavy bolter was familiar, a relief. Viola couldn’t take the monster down, but she could slow it, keep it back. The daemon juddered under the impacts. It paused, mouth open, hissing in frustration. ‘Are you such a weakling, Sister? Tumbling and fleeing?’ Augusta ignored the goad, kept moving. ‘The statue!’ Jatoya said. ‘You must observe this for yourself!’ The bolter hammered, flashes of rounds impacting from the daemon and from the surrounding stone. The creature was closer now. It raised a foot, stamping at the Sisters as Augusta had once stamped at the gretchin in the cathedral above, then slashed the axe at them, snarling. Fire flashed from the blade. Seeing it coming, Jatoya moved, but she was not fast enough; the edge of it caught her full in the chest, lifted her from the floor and slammed her back into the wall. The crunch of ceramite was unmistakeable, like the cry in the vox that was suddenly cut short. She slid to the floor, broken. ‘Jatoya!’ Viola was shouting, raw and wild. But the crumple of armour lay still. Wrath rose in Augusta’s heart – the sort of anger that burned from her skin, her weapons, her voice. She drew the chainsword, started the mechanism. She may not be able to kill this thing, but she was a Sister of Battle, a Daughter of the Emperor, and Jatoya was her second and her friend. The creature peered downwards. ‘You foolish little woman.’ The words were an accusation, a goad. ‘You think you can fight me?’ Augusta tightened her grip on the chainsword and the litany rose in her heart like the bells of the convent itself. But revenge was personal, prideful, and a sin. She was the faith and fist of the Imperial Creed – she fought in the name of the Emperor, not in her own. This thing was daemon and defiler, and she must stop it with whatever means she could muster… She had a mission to complete. She cast her gaze around and saw what Jatoya’s plan had been. In one of the colossal statues, the huge pillars of carved stone that stretched all the way to the roof of the chamber, there was a crack. A long crack, a fault-line that split the thing almost to the top. And in it, she had placed a krak grenade. The falling rock may well kill all of them, but it would slow the monster enough. ‘Truly,’ Augusta whispered softly, ‘you are blessed with wit as well as weaponry.’ Then, over the vox: ‘Akemi,’ she said, ‘how much time do you need?’ But it was Melia who replied, ‘Sister! We are under attack!’ There were only the three of them – no heavy bolter, no flamer, no chainsword. Subul stood with the impossible brass mirror behind him, its roil and seethe surrounding his flesh with the raw, hot churn of Chaos. They could hear the daemon, its voice interwoven with Subul’s, mocking Augusta for her cowardice; they could feel their own rage, but they were focused upon the advancing hounds. Shoulders low and bellies slinking, the beasts approached the three women, savage and eager. Melia’s orders were calm, clear. ‘Short, focused bursts. And sing, my Sisters, for the Emperor is with us!’ The hounds’ daemon master snarled the order to attack. Three bolters barked; one of the beasts twisted and faded, its essence sucked back towards the portal. But two were still moving and their master came with them, blade shining red in the light. ‘Again!’ Melia’s order was unnecessary; a split-second later, the bolters barked a second time. But the beasts were close now, too close. Akemi heard the conversation in the pit, the words in the vox. She heard Jatoya’s cry. Then one of the things was upon her, leaping for her throat. She went backwards, grappling for its collar. The daemon driving them was snarling and hissing in a language that made chills chase along her skin. And the beast was right in her face, yammering at her. Its teeth were bared and its breath was making her visor steam over; she couldn’t see, couldn’t think, couldn’t move. Panic rose in her heart. She heard Caia swear, heard Melia bark another order but the creature was right there and the words were lost in the chaos… Chaos. Another flash of memory: her brief studies of the Ruinous Powers, in the schola, all of them strictly supervised. She had opened the scrolls and read the words and felt her flesh crawling in response. But the memory was gone again, lost under the weight of the thing, under the horror of it so close and the smog of its breath in her visor. It stank like sulphur; its jaws were either side of her gorget, and she could feel it, straining to bite down. She remembered the litany, the words rising almost reflexively. Her frantic hands found the thing’s collar and dragged it away from her face. It scrabbled, claws scraping on ceramite with a noise that set her teeth on edge. She gripped it in one hand, brought the bolter up in the other. With its bared teeth no more than a smoky smear, she put the bolter against its skull, and pulled the trigger. Red splattered, blinding her completely. The creature’s weight was gone. She came up to her feet, shaking, her gauntlet scraping the blood from her face. In the chamber, only one of the creatures was still upright, coiling at its master’s hooved feet. The blood­letter had raised its blade and was facing the three of them. The glow of the portal shone from its eyes. Akemi felt Caia and Melia as they pulled together, felt the strong bond of her Sisters. Subul, furious, was roaring, his many-layered voice half-chant, half-outrage. The colours at the centre of the mirror had changed hue; they were fierce and bright, rich with the tones of brass and blood. And there were noises coming from it now, echoes of screams and warfare, of clashing weapons and gunfire, of massive, rumbling engines. Instinctively, Akemi knew that there were more of the creatures coming. And then more, and then more. They would never end; the portal would spew them forth in their thousands. ‘We have to stop him!’ She raised her bolter, unaware she’d said the words aloud. Subul’s chant grew higher. And then, with a thunderous roar, the whole chamber shook. The detonation knocked Augusta from her feet. Above her, the statue trembled, tottered and fell. One side slid clear, a cascade of heavy stone that hit the daemon’s shoulders and rocked it on its hooves; the other side stayed upright for a moment, then followed it down. It went over sideways in a single piece that struck the thing an immense, heavy blow. The daemon faltered, stumbled. Its axe hit the floor with a crash. But even as it was getting up again, reaching for the weapon, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Target its hands!’ The heavy bolter roared, its full rate of fire aimed at the monster’s whip-hand. It wasn’t enough – even under the repeated impacts of the heavy bolter, the daemon seemed to shrug off the damage. It came back to its feet, rocks sliding from it; it reached to pick up the axe. Its anger was tangible, now; it filled the air. The steam that poured from its shoulders was thick, ropes of it rising to the roof of the cavern, boiling like the jungle’s mist. Teeth bared, it roared at them, inarticulate and furious. The hate was like a fist in the face, a punch in the gut – only the bright flame of Augusta’s faith was keeping her on her feet. ‘I do not fear you,’ she told it. ‘In the Emperor’s name, we finish this.’ The concussion had knocked the bloodletter from its feet. It was scrambling back upright even as the detonation faded, but it was not fast enough. Melia was after it in a moment, kicking its blade away from its hand, finishing the last hound with a single, accurate shot. Behind her, Caia placed one boot on the daemon’s chest. Even as Akemi was gathering her wits, Caia snarled a war-prayer, and shot the thing in the face. Gore splashed; the creature snarled and struggled. But Caia kept firing, and kept firing, one round after another, again and again, her voice rising to a paean that was almost a shriek. The thing finally detonated and she stumbled forwards, falling to her knees. She stopped, her shoulders shaking, blood leaking down her injured arm. But Akemi had turned to Subul, and to the mirror. The summoner was snarling his chant, his face distorted. The symbol on his head pulsed with blood and light; its red glare lit the walls. He was savage, furious, and the daemon’s roars were echoing out of his mouth. Steam was starting to steal across the roof of the chamber, but it was too late. Subul may have the voice of the daemon, but he was only a man. Only a heretic, who had dared to risk his soul for the false powers of Chaos. ‘I do not fear you.’ Akemi repeated Augusta’s words. ‘In the Emperor’s name, we finish this.’ She aimed her bolter at the symbol on his forehead, and pulled the trigger.",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Watching the monster, Augusta listened to Akemi’s frantic outline, her memory of her lesson from the schola. The Sister Superior had faced daemons before, and she knew the truth of what Akemi was saying. ‘Sister Akemi, you are truly blessed with wisdom.’ Augusta inhaled, made her decision, gave her orders, soft and urgent. ‘Go. Take the others with you. Find him. Jatoya, stay with me.’ ‘I would not be anywhere else,’ Jatoya said. The touch of her second’s strength and friendship was powerful, a touch of faith in the clamouring dark. She heard the others scrabble as they crossed the cavern floor. The colossal might of the daemon laughed ever harder. ‘So you flee, little Sisters? So much for your devotion.’ ‘We have devotion, daemon!’ The voice was Viola’s. A flash of pure adrenaline shot through Augusta’s nerves. ‘Viola.’ Her words over the vox were swift and quiet. ‘Follow your orders.’ She didn’t turn, couldn’t take her attention from the titanic, looming height of the monster, but she could still hear the bootsteps as the younger Sister walked across the floor of the cavern. ‘I am a Daughter of the Emperor,’ Viola called. ‘A Sister of the Bloody Rose. A follower of Saint Mina. And I do not fear you, daemon, any more than I fear orks, or any other denizen of the darkness! I defy you!’ Her voice was shaking with outrage – but Augusta could hear the truth of it. Viola’s boldness was pure swagger; under the pressure of the daemon’s presence, she had a need to prove herself worthy, to live up to the thrice-blessed weapon that she bore. ‘And I will send you back!’ ‘Viola!’ The Sister Superior’s bark was stronger, this time. ‘Follow your orders!’ But Viola did not reply – she may even have turned off her vox. She came forwards into Augusta’s peripheral vision, an upright figure in blood-soaked scarlet, her cloak blackened by flames, her single merit-bead flickering in the firelight. The heavy bolter was raised, nestled against her shoulder. ‘Child,’ the daemon said. Its voice was soaked in scorn. ‘I will peel every inch of skin from your body.’ ‘Try it,’ Jatoya muttered. Whether it heard her or not, it raised the whip, curling its thongs upwards and over its head. Augusta knew that one lash from that weapon would break Viola in half, armour and all. But as it came down, Jatoya was already moving. Akemi scrambled across the floor of the cavern, away from the monster and the firelight and towards the bottom of the staircase. Words tumbled from her as she ran. ‘Subul,’ she said. ‘We need to find him. And fast.’ The others followed her as ordered, their confusion not voiced aloud. She replied to it anyway. ‘Think about it,’ she said. ‘There has been so much bloodshed here, and for thousands of years – from the Age of Strife, and in the cathedral’s valetudinarium… Sister Jatoya was right – the blood-worship is soaked into the very stone here.’ ‘What about the town?’ Caia asked. ‘They embraced the Emperor, welcomed the return to their faith of the Great Crusade…’ ‘Many embraced the Emperor, certainly,’ Melia said. ‘But the darkness has always been here, twisting and lying and deceiving. This whole world is a battleground.’ ‘Then we will win that battle,’ Caia said, simply. ‘Once and for all.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Kawa tried to fight,’ Akemi said, still thinking aloud. ‘Maybe Subul used her death as a summoning ritual, maybe the summoning itself was accidental – just too much bloodshed – I don’t know. But…’ she paused, turned round, ‘Subul bears the mark of Khorne, and if we can find him…’ ‘We will banish the daemon?’ ‘We will banish the daemon.’ Caia had her flickering auspex in her hand and was trying to understand the endless tangles of tunnels, the erratic distant blips of motion. They raced back up the long curve of the steps to the last side passage, and the direction that Subul had taken. But Caia shook her head. ‘The signal’s gone. This place is like a nightmare. How do we find him in all this?’ Akemi controlled her rising impatience, resisted the urge to grab the auspex and look for herself. Then Melia pointed, ‘There.’ On the stone ahead of them: a tiny smear of red. ‘Quietly, Sisters,’ she said. ‘Let us take this carefully and not let him know we’re coming.’ Akemi wanted to point out that they didn’t have time to spare – but she also didn’t want to doubt the strength and faith of the Sisters now below them. Then Caia suddenly said, ‘Where’s Viola?’ The crack of the whip sent a sharp detonation through the air. The stone shook. Augusta did not move. She saw Jatoya slam Viola clean in the belly, taking the younger Sister off her feet. The whip curled over Viola’s head just as the pair of them hit the ground. They rolled back upright in seconds. In defiance of her orders, Viola was again raising the bolter. Augusta would discipline her squad member later. Now, she bellowed, ‘To me, both of you!’ Both Sisters started to move, but the descending clang of the axeblade was too close, and it sent them sprawling. Snarling, the daemon raised the weapon just enough to crush both of them where they lay– ‘Wait!’ Augusta stepped forwards, bellowing up at the thing. ‘You’ll face me, daemon, not them.’ ‘What are you doing?’ Jatoya asked. The squad’s second was pulling Viola to her feet, but the younger Sister was struggling to rise. She was chanting the same line of the litany, over and over again. From the begetting of daemons… the begetting of daemons… Augusta said, ‘Giving Akemi time.’ The daemon hissed through long, stained teeth. ‘Why? I could kill all of you with a flick, with a finger. I could hold you over the fire and flay you while you still lived.’ Because the error of this place was mine, and they should not pay for it… ‘You don’t fear me, do you?’ Her shout rang from the stone, mocking. ‘Do you fear to lose?’ Caught, the thing mantled its wings and hissed, stooping forwards to study her. Its head was bigger than she was, its eyes like pits of fire and death. As it came close, Augusta felt her throat close, her blood turn utterly cold. The screaming… The blood… The hooks… But she could also see a red Sabbat-pattern helmet, bloodied skull still within, that was hung about its neck like a trophy. It was the one that had been missing from the previous chamber. Felicity. And her anger came flooding back to her, her faith and her strength. ‘A morte perpetua. Domine, libra nos.’ The monster snarled. ‘You foolish women are all the same.’ Its breath was caustic, polluted. ‘So proud, so eager to die.’ ‘I will take you with me.’ That made it laugh again, a deep rumble like falling stone. It stood back upright and threw back its head… …but now, Augusta could see that Akemi had been right – the voice did not belong to the creature. ‘Your Sister said exactly the same thing,’ it said, but the words were posturing, empty. And hope unfurled like a flag in her chest. Three scarlet figures slunk along the edge of the wall. They had no need for the auspex; they could hear the movement, now, hear the voices from ahead of them. Hear the many-layered bass boom that was Subul, the summoner. Akemi was beginning to understand that the daemon had always been here, that the blood shed down through the generations had called it back to the stone, again and again. And she could remember the stylised illustration in the schola’s manuscript – the cult leader with his symbol, his arms raised. They needed to find and slay him, and end this ordeal. Then they could return to the cathedral, and to the town, and they could begin their work anew. Or raze the building completely. The three Sisters turned the last corner of the tunnel. Ahead of them, there was light. It was the same rich, red light that came from the fire below – as if the flames themselves were somehow thick with blood. It had all come from here. The chamber was bright with flame – it had an open viewing port that allowed its occupants to see down into the pit. Down there, Augusta would face the daemon and she would try to give Akemi enough time… But Subul was not alone. One of the smaller creatures stood with him, flanking him like a guard, its hooves tamping restlessly on the rough stone floor. About its ankles curled another three of the red-skinned hounds. And Subul himself. He stood before an angled metal machine – a smaller thing, but a thing that looked exactly like the dead sculptures of the town. This one, however, was very much alive – and it defied her vision, its corners impossible, its edges bright with a hot, brass gleam. Writing writhed about it, seething in the air, and it contained an outline like some ancient mirror, a thing that roiled with mists of scarlet. It did not reflect the room, nor the figures within. Not a construction device, as Jencir had first guessed, but a portal. In its presence, Caia’s auspex flickered, guttered and burst into flame. With a startled curse, she dropped it. At the sound, the summoner turned around, the vortex in the mirror haloing him in pure, Chaotic power. Subul’s grin was unchanged, and the symbol on his head still ran scarlet with his own blood. The flow had blinded him completely, but his sightlessness was not a hindrance and he laughed the bass laugh of the daemon. ‘Ah,’ he said. ‘You are wise indeed, little Sisters.’ The hounds curled at his feet, bristling and snarling. ‘But you are not nearly strong enough. I can call forth endless foes, an army to walk over your corpses and to own this planet entire. And when your canoness comes – which she will – I can take her shuttles, and her ships. I can access the moon, and the fuel that it bears. And then, I can be freed from this rock.’ ‘So that’s it,’ Melia said. ‘You want the warships.’ ‘Your Mechanicus are easy bait, and your Order both warlike and prideful. You are simple to lead, and simple to slay. And this will be your ending, once and for all.’ His grin broadened, wider than his face. ‘Fitting, that Mina’s Order should make its last stand here, facing its oldest foes. And I… I will be free to leave. To carry the power of the Blood God across the galaxy!’ Melia made no response. She raised her bolter and pulled the trigger. But Subul was no longer there. Somehow, he’d slipped sideways and the round hit the flaming, churning, seething mass that was the centre of the mirror. The daemon hissed as if it were laughing. And the hounds leapt forwards. Down her long years of combat, there were many times that Augusta had been thankful for the care and attention she gave her armour, for the faith and training and discipline that kept her wargear immaculate. As the impossibly huge axeblade crashed to the floor just beside where she’d been standing, this was one of those times. The armour would not have stopped the blow, but it moved fluidly despite its weight, and it allowed her to dodge and roll. She came to her feet, blade still in hand, the Litany of Battle rumbling in her throat like a growl. But, defiance aside, she also had a solidly practical understanding of the might of the daemon – if that axe hit her, she would not get up again. And she had to give Akemi time. Facing the thing, she fought to banish its darkness from her mind, seeking a weak point, an advantage. She had better reactions, more manoeuvrability – yet its words had caught her, like a hook in her skin. Like your whole blood-armoured Order… This beast had slain Felicity. Dismembered her squad. Peeled the skin from Jencir’s skull and soaked the high altar in his life. In her head, she could hear the tech-priest, screaming like the Hephaestian miners… Snarling denial, she roared, ‘Mori blasphemous fui!’ The whip-thongs circled and snapped over its head, the noise of them deafening. Brass spikes sparked with flame. But as the baffles in her vox-bead kicked in, she became aware of Jatoya’s deep voice, urgent words in her ear. She softened the litany to a whisper, fierce and quiet. ‘His hand has guided us, Sister. He has shown us the way.’ ‘What do you intend?’ Augusta said. ‘Quickly!’ She threw herself backwards as the whip snapped at her again, an inch from her gorget. The detonation of it almost made her stumble. ‘Viola!’ Jatoya barked the order. The roaring bark of the heavy bolter was familiar, a relief. Viola couldn’t take the monster down, but she could slow it, keep it back. The daemon juddered under the impacts. It paused, mouth open, hissing in frustration. ‘Are you such a weakling, Sister? Tumbling and fleeing?’ Augusta ignored the goad, kept moving. ‘The statue!’ Jatoya said. ‘You must observe this for yourself!’ The bolter hammered, flashes of rounds impacting from the daemon and from the surrounding stone. The creature was closer now. It raised a foot, stamping at the Sisters as Augusta had once stamped at the gretchin in the cathedral above, then slashed the axe at them, snarling. Fire flashed from the blade. Seeing it coming, Jatoya moved, but she was not fast enough; the edge of it caught her full in the chest, lifted her from the floor and slammed her back into the wall. The crunch of ceramite was unmistakeable, like the cry in the vox that was suddenly cut short. She slid to the floor, broken. ‘Jatoya!’ Viola was shouting, raw and wild. But the crumple of armour lay still. Wrath rose in Augusta’s heart – the sort of anger that burned from her skin, her weapons, her voice. She drew the chainsword, started the mechanism. She may not be able to kill this thing, but she was a Sister of Battle, a Daughter of the Emperor, and Jatoya was her second and her friend. The creature peered downwards. ‘You foolish little woman.’ The words were an accusation, a goad. ‘You think you can fight me?’ Augusta tightened her grip on the chainsword and the litany rose in her heart like the bells of the convent itself. But revenge was personal, prideful, and a sin. She was the faith and fist of the Imperial Creed – she fought in the name of the Emperor, not in her own. This thing was daemon and defiler, and she must stop it with whatever means she could muster… She had a mission to complete. She cast her gaze around and saw what Jatoya’s plan had been. In one of the colossal statues, the huge pillars of carved stone that stretched all the way to the roof of the chamber, there was a crack. A long crack, a fault-line that split the thing almost to the top. And in it, she had placed a krak grenade. The falling rock may well kill all of them, but it would slow the monster enough. ‘Truly,’ Augusta whispered softly, ‘you are blessed with wit as well as weaponry.’ Then, over the vox: ‘Akemi,’ she said, ‘how much time do you need?’ But it was Melia who replied, ‘Sister! We are under attack!’ There were only the three of them – no heavy bolter, no flamer, no chainsword. Subul stood with the impossible brass mirror behind him, its roil and seethe surrounding his flesh with the raw, hot churn of Chaos. They could hear the daemon, its voice interwoven with Subul’s, mocking Augusta for her cowardice; they could feel their own rage, but they were focused upon the advancing hounds. Shoulders low and bellies slinking, the beasts approached the three women, savage and eager. Melia’s orders were calm, clear. ‘Short, focused bursts. And sing, my Sisters, for the Emperor is with us!’ The hounds’ daemon master snarled the order to attack. Three bolters barked; one of the beasts twisted and faded, its essence sucked back towards the portal. But two were still moving and their master came with them, blade shining red in the light. ‘Again!’ Melia’s order was unnecessary; a split-second later, the bolters barked a second time. But the beasts were close now, too close. Akemi heard the conversation in the pit, the words in the vox. She heard Jatoya’s cry. Then one of the things was upon her, leaping for her throat. She went backwards, grappling for its collar. The daemon driving them was snarling and hissing in a language that made chills chase along her skin. And the beast was right in her face, yammering at her. Its teeth were bared and its breath was making her visor steam over; she couldn’t see, couldn’t think, couldn’t move. Panic rose in her heart. She heard Caia swear, heard Melia bark another order but the creature was right there and the words were lost in the chaos… Chaos. Another flash of memory: her brief studies of the Ruinous Powers, in the schola, all of them strictly supervised. She had opened the scrolls and read the words and felt her flesh crawling in response. But the memory was gone again, lost under the weight of the thing, under the horror of it so close and the smog of its breath in her visor. It stank like sulphur; its jaws were either side of her gorget, and she could feel it, straining to bite down. She remembered the litany, the words rising almost reflexively. Her frantic hands found the thing’s collar and dragged it away from her face. It scrabbled, claws scraping on ceramite with a noise that set her teeth on edge. She gripped it in one hand, brought the bolter up in the other. With its bared teeth no more than a smoky smear, she put the bolter against its skull, and pulled the trigger. Red splattered, blinding her completely. The creature’s weight was gone. She came up to her feet, shaking, her gauntlet scraping the blood from her face. In the chamber, only one of the creatures was still upright, coiling at its master’s hooved feet. The blood­letter had raised its blade and was facing the three of them. The glow of the portal shone from its eyes. Akemi felt Caia and Melia as they pulled together, felt the strong bond of her Sisters. Subul, furious, was roaring, his many-layered voice half-chant, half-outrage. The colours at the centre of the mirror had changed hue; they were fierce and bright, rich with the tones of brass and blood. And there were noises coming from it now, echoes of screams and warfare, of clashing weapons and gunfire, of massive, rumbling engines. Instinctively, Akemi knew that there were more of the creatures coming. And then more, and then more. They would never end; the portal would spew them forth in their thousands. ‘We have to stop him!’ She raised her bolter, unaware she’d said the words aloud. Subul’s chant grew higher. And then, with a thunderous roar, the whole chamber shook. The detonation knocked Augusta from her feet. Above her, the statue trembled, tottered and fell.

It went over sideways in a single piece that struck the thing an immense, heavy blow. The daemon faltered, stumbled. Its axe hit the floor with a crash. But even as it was getting up again, reaching for the weapon, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Target its hands!’ The heavy bolter roared, its full rate of fire aimed at the monster’s whip-hand. It wasn’t enough – even under the repeated impacts of the heavy bolter, the daemon seemed to shrug off the damage. It came back to its feet, rocks sliding from it; it reached to pick up the axe.

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN The daemon exploded with a horrific, echoing howl. The sound shook the cavern; rubble rumbled from the toppled statue. Then: silence. Viola loosed a battle cry, raising her voice in a hymn of thanks. Augusta felt relief unfurling in her soul, the release from the stink and rage and pressure of the daemon’s presence. For a moment, she felt almost weightless. Truly, the Emperor had blessed them. But the mission was not yet over. Walking to where Jatoya had fallen, she said, ‘Sister Akemi?’ Akemi’s voice came back over the vox. ‘Praise the Emperor, Sister. Subul is dead. The gate is closed.’ ‘Be sure.’ At the base of the wall, the heap of red armour was crushed, cracked and splintered by the strike of the axe. ‘Oh, we’re sure.’ The voice was Caia’s, her tone dark and lethal. ‘We have placed grenades, ready to collapse the machinery. If we can.’ ‘You and Akemi hold that location,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Melia, I need you here.’ Carefully, she turned Jatoya’s helm to check the life signal. ‘Sister?’ Viola joined her, her voice filled with concern. Augusta stood back, breathing hard. It took a moment before she could speak, and when she did her words were heavy and soft. ‘She walks at His feet. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘No.’ Viola’s breath caught on a sob – a sound that was as much exhaustion as grief. ‘Blessed be… blessed be her memory.’ ‘This place is accursed,’ Augusta said. ‘Too many Sisters have laid down their lives.’ She watched the crumpled form for a minute, then said, ‘Sister Viola.’ Viola raised her chin. ‘Sister Superior.’ ‘You disobeyed my order, Viola.’ Her words were flat, somehow empty of all feeling; suddenly, she felt very tired. ‘When commanded to leave with the rest of the squad, you stayed to face the daemon. I do not need to remind you of the schola’s most basic lessons – that we must all rely upon the unity, courage and the trustworthiness of our Sisters. An order disobeyed can spell death for a squad in the field.’ Viola flinched, looking at the broken armour beside them. ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Not only that, but you acted out of a purely personal need – a need to prove yourself. You did not act for the good of the unit, nor for your love of the Emperor. Do you have anything to say to me, Sister?’ Viola paused. She inhaled, as if searching for the right words, then her shoulders sagged once more. ‘No, Sister. I wanted–’ ‘What you “wanted” is irrelevant. Your need for personal merit overcame both your training and your orders.’ Viola said, her voice quiet, ‘Sister, you could not have held back the daemon without me, and without the heavy bolter. I disobeyed the order because I feared for the failure of the mission.’ She paused, then said, ‘I will accept whatever discipline you feel is necessary.’ The Sister Superior drew in a breath. Jatoya’s death had not been Viola’s doing, but still, a splinter of anger was caught in Augusta’s heart. With an effort, she mastered it. ‘Disobeying a direct order should see you among the Repentia,’ she said. ‘Or at the very least your badge of merit removed.’ ‘Yes, Sister. I understand.’ Augusta considered her. The young woman’s head was bowed and her attitude contrite. Her lone adamantium bead glinted – the award she had received for the death of the ork warlord. ‘I feel, Sister Viola,’ Augusta said, ‘that you were unready for your field promotion, and you have been daunted by the expectation that it has laid upon your shoulders.’ Viola looked up, her expression wary. ‘Yet you have faced your task with courage and you have learned to use the weapon with great speed, great skill and great accuracy.’ Viola watched her, still unspeaking. ‘We will undertake suitable atonement,’ the Sister Superior said, her decision reached. ‘We will retrieve our fallen Sisters. We will carry them back to the township where we will raise a pyre to Sister Jatoya, to Sister Felicity and her squad, to the tech-priest Jencir and the missionary Lyconides, and to Kawa Koumu and the bravery of her warriors. We will cleanse both the cathedral and the shrines of the town, and we will grant a final blessing to those who have attained the Emperor’s side.’ ‘Sister?’ Viola’s tone was surprised. ‘You–?’ ‘I must accept responsibility for my decisions,’ Augusta said. ‘I made the choice to promote you to Sister Kimura’s role. And by my failure was Chaos loosed within this place.’ She glanced at the smoking daemon flesh strewn across the floor, at the last of the skulls in the firepit. ‘This planet has seen me err too many times – the blame for all of these deaths is mine. And may the Emperor accept my penitence.’ In the thick night of the Lautis jungle, the flames burned high. Behind them, the twin guards of the ziggurat flickered in the light, and its stepped, dark shape angled upwards into the sky. At its peak, the ancient depiction of the Emperor looked out across the empty town. Watching the hot, bright fire that consumed the figure within, Augusta had removed both helmet and gauntlets. The night air was heavy and warm, but its comparative freshness was welcome. She looked around the gathered squad, all of them bare-headed and weary. Their armour was scratched and dented, their cloaks stained and filthy – but she was proud of every one of them. Even Viola, despite her insubordination. ‘I have transmitted the report,’ she told them. ‘And there are enough supplies within the basecamp to sustain us until the Tukril arrives from Mars, the Kyrus with it. Our mission, Sisters,’ she tried to stop the bitterness in her tone, ‘has been a success.’ ‘How long will we be here?’ Melia asked. ‘Sixty-five days.’ Her response was met with a dismayed silence – she knew full well that her squad did not wish to stay here, never mind for two Solar months. But she was not finished. ‘But be warned – we are not on hiatus, Sisters, and we must maintain our guard. Where Chaos has manifested, it may yet still return – and it is up to us to ensure that the cathedral and its tunnels remain free from any taint. The patrol work may be tedious, but it is as much a part of our calling as the banishment of the beast itself.’ She paused, but her squad still said nothing. They only stood listening to the brief. ‘And we must not err.’ Beside her in the firelight, Akemi said, ‘What of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Sister? With the Tukril returning…’ She let the query tail off into silence, but Augusta understood. The daemon had said that they were easy to lure, implying that Jencir had known of the machinery, and had come to Lautis not to rebuild, but for reasons of his own. The curiosity of the Adeptus Mechanicus, as Jatoya had commented, was often their undoing. ‘We will greet them upon their arrival and discover the parameters of their mission. I await the orders of the ­canoness – it may well be that the cathedral and the town will be destroyed. Certainly, it would be the most secure outcome.’ On the far side of the fire, Viola stared down into the flame, her armour gleaming. She had been very quiet on their careful retreat from the cathedral’s undertunnels, retrieving Jatoya and the gruesome remains of the fallen squad and obeying every command without question. And there had been no further sign of her outspoken bluster. At Augusta’s words, she glanced up. ‘Permission to ask a question, Sister?’ ‘Of course,’ Augusta said. ‘Why is it that the Adeptus Mechanicus have such a tie to our Order?’ Akemi, standing at the fireside and flicking her little fetish between her fingers, glanced up as if eager to answer, but Augusta said, ‘You know the legend of Saint Mina, Viola. It was the very first doctrine you studied when you joined this Order.’ Viola nodded, ‘Yes, Sister.’ Augusta said, ‘Saint Mina was martyred upon the Mechanicus planet of Hydraphur. She was slain at a small shrine and her body was drained of all blood. Yet still, her blade slew hundreds of her foes.’ ‘Then perhaps Jencir’s curiosity was not just the machinery,’ Viola commented. ‘Perhaps,’ Augusta said. ‘The Mechanicus have been political supporters of our Order for many centuries.’ She let herself smile. ‘If Akemi can read enough of his notes, we may even find out.’ Akemi made a face. ‘But – what about the vial?’ Melia said. ‘The daemon Subul mentioned a vial of Mina’s blood. Do we believe that such an artefact really exists?’ ‘Subul was playing games,’ Augusta said. ‘Games of words. He was taunting and provoking us and trying to make us falter.’ Her smile was grim. ‘In drawing a comparison between ourselves and the bloodlust of the followers of Khorne, he was calling everything we are into question, the entire history of our Order. But we have faced his mockery, Sisters. We have faced the minion of Chaos, faced blood and fire and death. And while we may know rage and warfare and the pure anger of the Emperor’s wrath, there remains a difference between our desire for battle and theirs.’ The others watched her; her gaze stopped on Sister Viola. ‘We fight in the Emperor’s name,’ Viola said. ‘We have purpose.’ ‘Just so,’ Augusta agreed with her. ‘And we fight with control. We embrace the rage, but we use it wisely. It never commands us. And that, above all things, is why our discipline matters.’ Viola flushed, understanding all too well the point that Augusta was making. ‘As to the vial,’ the Sister Superior said. ‘Daemons are the masters of deceit. We cannot know if such a thing exists.’ ‘But,’ Melia said, ‘in the days to come, we will have time. We can search for it while we patrol.’ Caia said, ‘I will find it.’ ‘I don’t doubt it,’ Melia told her. From somewhere, a cawing cry split the darkness, and made them jump. Akemi said, ‘The wildlife of the jungle – it’s coming back.’ Caia looked ruefully at her broken auspex. ‘I suppose we had better set a watch.’ ‘I will watch,’ Augusta told them. ‘And I will pray. Take the rest, my Sisters, you’ve earned it.’ She moved away from the firelight to find a vantage. As her weary squad settled to watch the flame, she stood like the warriors of the ziggurat, silent and on guard. Watching the Sister Superior leave the firelight, Sister Akemi flicked her little fetish between her fingers. She had survived. She had faced her fears, faced the powers of darkness. She had spilled blood and taken lives, and seen the slavering maw of Chaos itself. She had felt the pure rage of her calling, the rise of defiance, exhilaration and courage that was the signature of her Order. And she had understood why it was different. She flicked the little silver icon, watching the light on the metal. It was precious to her – the symbol of the Order of the Quill. She had always kept it with her, despite her change of calling. The cawing rose again, now further away. Sister Akemi flicked the item one last time, and leaned forward to place it, carefully, in the flames. She had no regrets as to the decision she had made, and she needed the item no longer.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN The daemon exploded with a horrific, echoing howl. The sound shook the cavern; rubble rumbled from the toppled statue. Then: silence. Viola loosed a battle cry, raising her voice in a hymn of thanks. Augusta felt relief unfurling in her soul, the release from the stink and rage and pressure of the daemon’s presence. For a moment, she felt almost weightless. Truly, the Emperor had blessed them. But the mission was not yet over. Walking to where Jatoya had fallen, she said, ‘Sister Akemi?’ Akemi’s voice came back over the vox. ‘Praise the Emperor, Sister. Subul is dead. The gate is closed.’ ‘Be sure.’ At the base of the wall, the heap of red armour was crushed, cracked and splintered by the strike of the axe. ‘Oh, we’re sure.’ The voice was Caia’s, her tone dark and lethal. ‘We have placed grenades, ready to collapse the machinery. If we can.’ ‘You and Akemi hold that location,’ Augusta said. ‘Sister Melia, I need you here.’ Carefully, she turned Jatoya’s helm to check the life signal. ‘Sister?’ Viola joined her, her voice filled with concern. Augusta stood back, breathing hard. It took a moment before she could speak, and when she did her words were heavy and soft. ‘She walks at His feet. Blessed be her memory.’ ‘No.’ Viola’s breath caught on a sob – a sound that was as much exhaustion as grief. ‘Blessed be… blessed be her memory.’ ‘This place is accursed,’ Augusta said. ‘Too many Sisters have laid down their lives.’ She watched the crumpled form for a minute, then said, ‘Sister Viola.’ Viola raised her chin. ‘Sister Superior.’ ‘You disobeyed my order, Viola.’ Her words were flat, somehow empty of all feeling; suddenly, she felt very tired. ‘When commanded to leave with the rest of the squad, you stayed to face the daemon. I do not need to remind you of the schola’s most basic lessons – that we must all rely upon the unity, courage and the trustworthiness of our Sisters. An order disobeyed can spell death for a squad in the field.’ Viola flinched, looking at the broken armour beside them. ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Not only that, but you acted out of a purely personal need – a need to prove yourself. You did not act for the good of the unit, nor for your love of the Emperor. Do you have anything to say to me, Sister?’ Viola paused. She inhaled, as if searching for the right words, then her shoulders sagged once more. ‘No, Sister. I wanted–’ ‘What you “wanted” is irrelevant. Your need for personal merit overcame both your training and your orders.’ Viola said, her voice quiet, ‘Sister, you could not have held back the daemon without me, and without the heavy bolter. I disobeyed the order because I feared for the failure of the mission.’ She paused, then said, ‘I will accept whatever discipline you feel is necessary.’ The Sister Superior drew in a breath. Jatoya’s death had not been Viola’s doing, but still, a splinter of anger was caught in Augusta’s heart. With an effort, she mastered it. ‘Disobeying a direct order should see you among the Repentia,’ she said. ‘Or at the very least your badge of merit removed.’ ‘Yes, Sister. I understand.’ Augusta considered her. The young woman’s head was bowed and her attitude contrite. Her lone adamantium bead glinted – the award she had received for the death of the ork warlord. ‘I feel, Sister Viola,’ Augusta said, ‘that you were unready for your field promotion, and you have been daunted by the expectation that it has laid upon your shoulders.’ Viola looked up, her expression wary. ‘Yet you have faced your task with courage and you have learned to use the weapon with great speed, great skill and great accuracy.’ Viola watched her, still unspeaking. ‘We will undertake suitable atonement,’ the Sister Superior said, her decision reached. ‘We will retrieve our fallen Sisters. We will carry them back to the township where we will raise a pyre to Sister Jatoya, to Sister Felicity and her squad, to the tech-priest Jencir and the missionary Lyconides, and to Kawa Koumu and the bravery of her warriors. We will cleanse both the cathedral and the shrines of the town, and we will grant a final blessing to those who have attained the Emperor’s side.’ ‘Sister?’ Viola’s tone was surprised. ‘You–?’ ‘I must accept responsibility for my decisions,’ Augusta said. ‘I made the choice to promote you to Sister Kimura’s role. And by my failure was Chaos loosed within this place.’ She glanced at the smoking daemon flesh strewn across the floor, at the last of the skulls in the firepit. ‘This planet has seen me err too many times – the blame for all of these deaths is mine. And may the Emperor accept my penitence.’ In the thick night of the Lautis jungle, the flames burned high. Behind them, the twin guards of the ziggurat flickered in the light, and its stepped, dark shape angled upwards into the sky. At its peak, the ancient depiction of the Emperor looked out across the empty town. Watching the hot, bright fire that consumed the figure within, Augusta had removed both helmet and gauntlets. The night air was heavy and warm, but its comparative freshness was welcome. She looked around the gathered squad, all of them bare-headed and weary. Their armour was scratched and dented, their cloaks stained and filthy – but she was proud of every one of them. Even Viola, despite her insubordination. ‘I have transmitted the report,’ she told them. ‘And there are enough supplies within the basecamp to sustain us until the Tukril arrives from Mars, the Kyrus with it. Our mission, Sisters,’ she tried to stop the bitterness in her tone, ‘has been a success.’ ‘How long will we be here?’ Melia asked. ‘Sixty-five days.’ Her response was met with a dismayed silence – she knew full well that her squad did not wish to stay here, never mind for two Solar months. But she was not finished. ‘But be warned – we are not on hiatus, Sisters, and we must maintain our guard. Where Chaos has manifested, it may yet still return – and it is up to us to ensure that the cathedral and its tunnels remain free from any taint. The patrol work may be tedious, but it is as much a part of our calling as the banishment of the beast itself.’ She paused, but her squad still said nothing. They only stood listening to the brief. ‘And we must not err.’ Beside her in the firelight, Akemi said, ‘What of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Sister?

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE The broken steel gantry swayed and screeched. Backed to its outermost end, the wounded man had stumbled to his knees. Alone, unarmed, he held one hand to the smoking hole in his belly. The other supported him as he crashed forwards, coughing blood. He did not have long. ‘Aim!’ The sergeant’s bark was curt. It rang hollow, echoing loudly in the empty systems of pipes and conduits that towered around them, resonant in rust and decay. Nine lasguns tucked into nine shoulders. Nine tiny, red insects clustered on the man’s skull. The man made no move; he didn’t protest, or try to defend himself. He’d led them a long chase, but it was over. ‘Hold your fire.’ A woman’s voice, cool and controlled. The sergeant raised one hand from his weapon, and the squad paused. A small, grey-robed figure stepped through them, her black boots ringing on the metal walkway. Even in her ceramite armour, she was barely as high as the heavy sergeant’s shoulder, but her poise and bearing spoke of complete authority. Her head was bare and her white-threaded dark hair was braided tightly down her back. At her feet, an empty vat-tank stretched downwards into darkness. It had a mark stamped in its side – the cog-and-skull of Triplex Phall, and a line of Mechanicus numerals, noting its denomination. Somewhere at its base, there hissed the wash and seethe of liquid. But the woman did not look down. She said, ‘It’s over, Zale.’ The man did not respond. He was still coughing; his breath was harsh and ragged. Like the metal-stinking wind, it rose into the umber sky, and was gone. ‘Ma’am?’ The sergeant stood poised, his battered green armour-plates filthy with blown rust, his head still tilted into the rifle sight. She could feel his tension, his need to end this, once and for all. The squad’s lieutenant had already died on his knees – from the beginning, this entire mission had been littered with corpses – but such things were of little interest to her. She took a further step forwards, her gauntleted fist closing. The band of her signet ring bit into her flesh. She would take whatever action she deemed necessary. Curtly, she repeated the order. ‘I said, hold your fire.’ ‘Ma’am.’ The sergeant was a good man, solid. She felt his pressure on the trigger ease. Satisfied, she raised her voice, let her accusation sound like a paean from the crumbling pipework. ‘Scafidis Zale, you are a heretic and a traitor, and there is nowhere left for you to run. You will surrender, or you will fall to the waters below, and there you will dissolve. You will beg me for pity as they eat your living flesh, but there will be no pity, Zale, not for you. Repent here, and I may yet grant you your future, and your continued service to the God-Emperor.’ From somewhere, far out in the mess of refineries, machines and galleries, there came the sounds of shouting, and running boots. There was the hiss and boom of lasgun fire, a rise of laughter, the noise of fists on flesh. But she and the fallen man were intent only on each other. Slowly, the injured Zale sank backwards until he was sitting on his heels. His hand was still on his belly, his head bowed. The woman felt the sergeant tense. Rage and suspicion rose from his burly shoulders. Still, she did not give the order. She said, ‘Surrender, Zale.’ Feet sounded again, closer this time. Several of the soldiers twitched, but the noises soon clanged past them, and faded to echoes. And then, at the far end of the gantry, Scafidis Zale began to unfold. Slowly, he came to his feet. He moved like a performer, taking command of his stage. Nine points of light followed the motion. He didn’t care. Instead, he said one word, like a hiss of pure scorn… ‘Inquisitor.’ And he started to laugh. Lycheate. Once a forge world, a world of industry. Lycheate was a planet of refineries and manufactoria, of ferrous incinerators, of furnaces and vents, of the pulse and vein of living machinery. Once, Lycheate had thundered and rumbled with the fusion reactor deep at its core. It had been governed by its fabricator, and teeming with tech-priests, transmechanics, lexmechanics and enginseers. Once, Lycheate had been orbited by dozens of small moons, each one rich with promethium and rare ores, drilled with mines and worked by helots. Shuttles and cargo scows had ferried those ores to the planet’s surface, where they’d been assayed and smelted and forged, and then shipped out across the Imperium, the lifeblood of all mankind. Once. But Lycheate’s moons had long since been stripped bare. Its steelworks were empty, its forge-temples abandoned to the seething swarms of human and xenos scum that had moved in there. The planet had become a vacuum – a sucking, steel-walled cesspit that pulled in the lost, the heretic, the mutant, the cultist… All those who wanted to vanish, or who had nowhere else to go. Inquisitor Istrix, however, had no interest in the denizens of this place. She had walked fearless through their filth, untouched and uncaring – this world was a sewer, worthy only of Exterminatus. And that would come. For now, Istrix had a greater purpose. The inquisitor was focused purely on her quarry. She had hunted him, relentless, all the way from Terra itself, all through Scintilla and the mines on Sophano Prime, and finally out here, to the very edges of the Ultima Segmentum and the Calixis Sector. Now, she had him. And, as the wounded man came to his feet, his laughter ringing like the sounding of ancient hammers, Istrix gave thanks to the Emperor Himself that her long chase was over at last. ‘Inquisitor,’ he said. ‘Zale.’ Tiny, framed by the lost wealth of rust and decay, Istrix faced her foe. ‘There’s nowhere left to hide.’ But his laughter only grew. Ever the entertainer, he flicked his fingers. Screaming, the sergeant went over backwards, his lasrifle firing bursts of superheat at the pipework over their heads. Metal creaked and screamed and tore; debris plummeted past them, clattering and banging against the sides of the tank, splashing into the waters below. The sergeant had both hands clutched to his helmet; as he hit the walkway, he started to thrash, his feet hammering. The noise was incredible. Beside him, the lance-corporal turned on her fellows. Stepping back to use the lasrifle, too fast for anyone to react, she carved red light through three of her comrades, then turned the weapon on herself. Her last, mad laugh was cut off as the front of her helmet vanished in a hiss of steaming gore. She toppled over the edge, and was gone. No fool, the corporal barked an order. Five streaks of scarlet whooshed out at the figure on the gantry. But Zale was up, now. He was uninjured, and moving. Moving fast. Still laughing, he gave another, extravagant gesture. With a roar, forge fires boomed to sudden life; the rise of heat was staggering, blistering. Swearing, the corporal threw up his arms and fell back. The air shimmered and stank – fuel and fear and fumes. In the blur of it, Zale wavered and was gone. But Inquisitor Istrix did not move. She watched, impassive, as her grey robes ignited, as the scarred and grubby armour of the Astra Militarum began to char and smoke. Several of them were swearing, emptying water bottles or trying to smother the flames with their gloved hands. She could hear the corporal barking further orders, his nerve remarkably steady. Again, lasgun fire streaked across the air. She barked, ‘Hold your fire!’ The corporal echoed her order. The lasguns stilled. She heard one of them mutter, her voice confused, ‘Corp?’ The words were across the squad’s private channel, but Istrix could hear them quite clearly in her vox-bead. The man responded, his deep voice low, ‘You heard the inquisitor. Hold your fire.’ With a faint, cold smile, she took another step out onto the gantry, now swinging wildly from its overhead wires. The metal squealed in protest; it was already reddening to a dull, magma glow. Her burning robes billowed in the rising heat. +Issy.+ Zale’s laughter crawled into her ears, echoed through her skull. It took her brain apart, piece by piece; it touched old memories, the days of his training, now long-gone… She could hear him in her head. +You don’t have to do this.+ But he could not touch her; she belonged to the Emperor alone. He was a traitor, a failure – her failure. And he would surrender himself to Penitence. That, or lose his soul. She commanded the corporal to hold his position; walked three more steps out along the gantry. The roasting, searing heat clawed up at her from far below; the fall was hungry for her life. Her flapping robes burned higher; there was smoke in her eyes, her face. She felt her braid crisp and shrivel, burning like fuse wire; felt her skin start to soften. Felt the holes opening in her flesh. But she tightened her fist, feeling the signet ring. There was no heat, no flame. No forge. The pain was nothing. She said, ‘Your trickeries do not touch me, witch. The Emperor is with me.’ At the end of the walkway, his gold eyes now blazing with the lava-light of the glowing metal, his whole form rippling with power and illusion, Zale offered her a bow. Still laughing, he raised his hands, gestured again, tore a huge rent across the pipework to one side. Steam flooded out at her, hissing, then rose towards the brown and distant sky. Somewhere up there, debris shone like the stars. ‘I can tear out your heart,’ he told her softly, ‘and you know it.’ ‘This is nothing,’ she said. ‘Witchery. Illusion. The machine-spirits of this world are long dead.’ But Zale laughed like a daemon, his eyes still burning. Behind her, she heard a sudden, physical struggle, heard the corporal curse. Boots rang on the walkway, there was shouting, then a long, wailing cry as a second figure went over the edge. She did not bother to turn. ‘Mistress.’ The word was a caress. ‘You never learn. How many lives will you throw away? How many more will you send to the Emperor’s glory, before you see the truth? I will not surrender to the torture you call Penitence.’ ‘No more,’ Istrix said. ‘This is over.’ The awful heat yammered at her, searing her now-hairless scalp, hurting her lungs as she breathed it in. But she was stronger than this, better than this. ‘Then shoot me,’ he said to her softly. ‘If you can.’ She raised the bolter. And, with an ear-splitting screech, the gantry fell away beneath both of them. From its orbit of the jungle-planet Lautis, the Imperial frigate Kyrus had turned back to the vacuum of space. Called home by the astropaths, by the tides of the empyrean, it was returning to Ophelia VII, and to the Hallowed Spire of the Convent Sanctorum. Behind the heaviness of the Kyrus’ reinforced bulkheads, securely defended by its void shields and gunnery decks, there lay an empty, decorous hollow, like a hole in its heart. Floored with rockcrete flags, walled with glassaic windows, each one lit by a cunning strip of exterior biolume, this was the ship’s chapel, silent and chill. Neat lines of pews could seat almost a tenth of the Kyrus’ full crew; rows of faces, each man and woman looking up at the altar, and at the broad banner of the aquila that hung above. To one side of that central image hung the winged skull of the Imperial Navy, to the other, the twisting-fish symbol of the Kyrus herself. Flanked by the imagery, lit by the ever-shining glow of the electro-candles, stood the golden stone statue of the God-Emperor. Thirty feet at His Imperial shoulder and framed by the aquila’s wings, He stared out over the nave, His gaze clear, His expression stern. He demanded service. He accepted no compromise. He reminded every one of them of their faith, their courage, their sworn duty. And, from those rows of pews, the crew of the Kyrus could look upon Him, and leave this place uplifted, ready to carry His name out through the warp and to all corners of the Imperium. They would fight and die for Him, to the last man and woman. And they would do so gladly. Now, however, the pews were empty. Under the false vault of the rockcrete roof, the cherubim circled silently, their cold, augmetic gazes eyeing the space below. As the heavy hatchway clunked open, they blinked metal eyelids, recording every movement. A lone figure stepped through. It paused, silent. Bright in the chapel’s lume, its scarlet armour glittered, all ceramite and plasteel. Over this, it bore a black-and-white cloak, decorated with the symbol of the rose; the fabric billowed as it turned to close the hatch. A line of adamantine beads decorated its chaplet and, at its hips, there were slung a Godwyn De’az pattern bolter and a brutal, heavy-duty chainsword. Its – her – head was bare, revealing a stern bob of steel-grey hair and a distinctive tattoo. She said, though there were only the cherubim to hear, ‘In the name of Mina and the Golden Throne, I am the willing daughter of the God-Emperor. I come to listen, and to do His bidding.’ Sister Superior Augusta Santorus touched the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and bowed her head. The cherubim blinked again, their eyelids clicking. As if by their signal, servitors whirred from their resting places. Augusta lifted the bolter from her belt, unclipped the sword, and laid both in the offered brass trays. The soldiers of the Imperial Navy had no requirement to lay down their sidearms, but she, as outlined in the Accords of Deacis VI, entered His presence with humility – bare of weapons, and with her head bared to His light. Slowly, she walked up the aisle. But she did not look up. Since their departure from Lautis, Augusta had visited the chapel often. Not just offering the daily prayers of herself and her squad – and those soldiers of the Navy who’d wished to attend – but at other times, when the hollow was quiet, and she could focus her concentration. Augusta was the commander of her squad, a veteran ­warrior of twenty years’ experience. She had fought battles against xenos, daemon and heretic; she had pursued the foes of mankind to the very edges of space, and she had slain them all. But there was a darkness upon her heart that would not leave her, and that had brought her, once again, into His presence. It defied her comprehension – their previous mission had been a success. Upon Lautis, they had faced a greater daemon, and had banished it back to the warp. They had freed the jungle-planet from the daemon’s cultist followers, and had secured the ruined cathedral for their Order, the Order of the Bloody Rose. The Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priests and servitors arriving aboard the Tukril now held the building safely, and were beginning its reconstruction. The Kyrus had accompanied them, and had waited to assure their security. And now, the old frigate was taking the Sisters back home. Her boots loud in the chapel’s silence, Augusta reached the altar rail. The cherubim followed her movements, sharply watchful. She knelt, her grey bob of hair falling forwards over her face. Though they had defeated it, the Lautis daemon had left her with nightmares. It had infected her thoughts, plagued her dreams with Chaos and Ruin, with images both fearful and bloody. For long Solar weeks after its expulsion, she and the other members of her squad had awoken sweating, and had knelt in midnight prayer… Fortitudo est certa clara meo. My strength must be unfailing, my sight clear. Augusta did not fear the spewed-forth creatures of the warp. Yet Lautis had seen the deaths of two members of her squad – Sister Kimura, in the battle against the orks, and Sister Jatoya, her second and right arm, smashed by the daemon’s axe. Her lips moved in prayer: the Litany of Divine Guidance. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. In twenty long years of battle, Augusta had lost troops before. Her Sisters had been slain, but they had died with courage and honour and they stood now at His feet… Levis est mihi. Show me to the Light. …but her darkness did not diminish. She recalled the words of the cultist’s leader, Subul, the man who had summoned the daemon. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ For a moment, she dared raise her eyes to Him, framed by the light of the electro-candles… But it was too much. His expression was too austere, His judgement too stern. She was His daughter, her faith and weapons unquestioned, unquestionable; war was her craft and her study. Anger, grief – these were permitted, within proper confines. The loss of her discipline was not. Shamed, she lowered her gaze, back to the gleam of her armour, blood-red against the rockcrete floor. Whatever mission called them, it was His will, and they would praise His name, with hymn and blade and bolter, just as they had always done. We are strong, she told herself. We will not fail. Yet, as she completed her litany and came back to her feet, she wondered at the shadow that still lurked so deep, and at what it may mean for the future.",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE The broken steel gantry swayed and screeched. Backed to its outermost end, the wounded man had stumbled to his knees. Alone, unarmed, he held one hand to the smoking hole in his belly. The other supported him as he crashed forwards, coughing blood. He did not have long. ‘Aim!’ The sergeant’s bark was curt. It rang hollow, echoing loudly in the empty systems of pipes and conduits that towered around them, resonant in rust and decay. Nine lasguns tucked into nine shoulders. Nine tiny, red insects clustered on the man’s skull. The man made no move; he didn’t protest, or try to defend himself. He’d led them a long chase, but it was over. ‘Hold your fire.’ A woman’s voice, cool and controlled. The sergeant raised one hand from his weapon, and the squad paused. A small, grey-robed figure stepped through them, her black boots ringing on the metal walkway. Even in her ceramite armour, she was barely as high as the heavy sergeant’s shoulder, but her poise and bearing spoke of complete authority. Her head was bare and her white-threaded dark hair was braided tightly down her back. At her feet, an empty vat-tank stretched downwards into darkness. It had a mark stamped in its side – the cog-and-skull of Triplex Phall, and a line of Mechanicus numerals, noting its denomination. Somewhere at its base, there hissed the wash and seethe of liquid. But the woman did not look down. She said, ‘It’s over, Zale.’ The man did not respond. He was still coughing; his breath was harsh and ragged. Like the metal-stinking wind, it rose into the umber sky, and was gone. ‘Ma’am?’ The sergeant stood poised, his battered green armour-plates filthy with blown rust, his head still tilted into the rifle sight. She could feel his tension, his need to end this, once and for all. The squad’s lieutenant had already died on his knees – from the beginning, this entire mission had been littered with corpses – but such things were of little interest to her. She took a further step forwards, her gauntleted fist closing. The band of her signet ring bit into her flesh. She would take whatever action she deemed necessary. Curtly, she repeated the order. ‘I said, hold your fire.’ ‘Ma’am.’ The sergeant was a good man, solid. She felt his pressure on the trigger ease. Satisfied, she raised her voice, let her accusation sound like a paean from the crumbling pipework. ‘Scafidis Zale, you are a heretic and a traitor, and there is nowhere left for you to run. You will surrender, or you will fall to the waters below, and there you will dissolve. You will beg me for pity as they eat your living flesh, but there will be no pity, Zale, not for you. Repent here, and I may yet grant you your future, and your continued service to the God-Emperor.’ From somewhere, far out in the mess of refineries, machines and galleries, there came the sounds of shouting, and running boots. There was the hiss and boom of lasgun fire, a rise of laughter, the noise of fists on flesh. But she and the fallen man were intent only on each other. Slowly, the injured Zale sank backwards until he was sitting on his heels. His hand was still on his belly, his head bowed. The woman felt the sergeant tense. Rage and suspicion rose from his burly shoulders. Still, she did not give the order. She said, ‘Surrender, Zale.’ Feet sounded again, closer this time. Several of the soldiers twitched, but the noises soon clanged past them, and faded to echoes. And then, at the far end of the gantry, Scafidis Zale began to unfold. Slowly, he came to his feet. He moved like a performer, taking command of his stage. Nine points of light followed the motion. He didn’t care. Instead, he said one word, like a hiss of pure scorn… ‘Inquisitor.’ And he started to laugh. Lycheate. Once a forge world, a world of industry. Lycheate was a planet of refineries and manufactoria, of ferrous incinerators, of furnaces and vents, of the pulse and vein of living machinery. Once, Lycheate had thundered and rumbled with the fusion reactor deep at its core. It had been governed by its fabricator, and teeming with tech-priests, transmechanics, lexmechanics and enginseers. Once, Lycheate had been orbited by dozens of small moons, each one rich with promethium and rare ores, drilled with mines and worked by helots. Shuttles and cargo scows had ferried those ores to the planet’s surface, where they’d been assayed and smelted and forged, and then shipped out across the Imperium, the lifeblood of all mankind. Once. But Lycheate’s moons had long since been stripped bare. Its steelworks were empty, its forge-temples abandoned to the seething swarms of human and xenos scum that had moved in there. The planet had become a vacuum – a sucking, steel-walled cesspit that pulled in the lost, the heretic, the mutant, the cultist… All those who wanted to vanish, or who had nowhere else to go. Inquisitor Istrix, however, had no interest in the denizens of this place. She had walked fearless through their filth, untouched and uncaring – this world was a sewer, worthy only of Exterminatus. And that would come. For now, Istrix had a greater purpose. The inquisitor was focused purely on her quarry. She had hunted him, relentless, all the way from Terra itself, all through Scintilla and the mines on Sophano Prime, and finally out here, to the very edges of the Ultima Segmentum and the Calixis Sector. Now, she had him. And, as the wounded man came to his feet, his laughter ringing like the sounding of ancient hammers, Istrix gave thanks to the Emperor Himself that her long chase was over at last. ‘Inquisitor,’ he said. ‘Zale.’ Tiny, framed by the lost wealth of rust and decay, Istrix faced her foe. ‘There’s nowhere left to hide.’ But his laughter only grew. Ever the entertainer, he flicked his fingers. Screaming, the sergeant went over backwards, his lasrifle firing bursts of superheat at the pipework over their heads. Metal creaked and screamed and tore; debris plummeted past them, clattering and banging against the sides of the tank, splashing into the waters below. The sergeant had both hands clutched to his helmet; as he hit the walkway, he started to thrash, his feet hammering. The noise was incredible. Beside him, the lance-corporal turned on her fellows. Stepping back to use the lasrifle, too fast for anyone to react, she carved red light through three of her comrades, then turned the weapon on herself. Her last, mad laugh was cut off as the front of her helmet vanished in a hiss of steaming gore. She toppled over the edge, and was gone. No fool, the corporal barked an order. Five streaks of scarlet whooshed out at the figure on the gantry. But Zale was up, now. He was uninjured, and moving. Moving fast. Still laughing, he gave another, extravagant gesture. With a roar, forge fires boomed to sudden life; the rise of heat was staggering, blistering. Swearing, the corporal threw up his arms and fell back. The air shimmered and stank – fuel and fear and fumes. In the blur of it, Zale wavered and was gone. But Inquisitor Istrix did not move. She watched, impassive, as her grey robes ignited, as the scarred and grubby armour of the Astra Militarum began to char and smoke. Several of them were swearing, emptying water bottles or trying to smother the flames with their gloved hands. She could hear the corporal barking further orders, his nerve remarkably steady. Again, lasgun fire streaked across the air. She barked, ‘Hold your fire!’ The corporal echoed her order. The lasguns stilled. She heard one of them mutter, her voice confused, ‘Corp?’ The words were across the squad’s private channel, but Istrix could hear them quite clearly in her vox-bead. The man responded, his deep voice low, ‘You heard the inquisitor. Hold your fire.’ With a faint, cold smile, she took another step out onto the gantry, now swinging wildly from its overhead wires. The metal squealed in protest; it was already reddening to a dull, magma glow. Her burning robes billowed in the rising heat. +Issy.+ Zale’s laughter crawled into her ears, echoed through her skull. It took her brain apart, piece by piece; it touched old memories, the days of his training, now long-gone… She could hear him in her head. +You don’t have to do this.+ But he could not touch her; she belonged to the Emperor alone. He was a traitor, a failure – her failure. And he would surrender himself to Penitence. That, or lose his soul. She commanded the corporal to hold his position; walked three more steps out along the gantry. The roasting, searing heat clawed up at her from far below; the fall was hungry for her life. Her flapping robes burned higher; there was smoke in her eyes, her face. She felt her braid crisp and shrivel, burning like fuse wire; felt her skin start to soften. Felt the holes opening in her flesh. But she tightened her fist, feeling the signet ring. There was no heat, no flame. No forge. The pain was nothing. She said, ‘Your trickeries do not touch me, witch. The Emperor is with me.’ At the end of the walkway, his gold eyes now blazing with the lava-light of the glowing metal, his whole form rippling with power and illusion, Zale offered her a bow. Still laughing, he raised his hands, gestured again, tore a huge rent across the pipework to one side. Steam flooded out at her, hissing, then rose towards the brown and distant sky. Somewhere up there, debris shone like the stars. ‘I can tear out your heart,’ he told her softly, ‘and you know it.’ ‘This is nothing,’ she said. ‘Witchery. Illusion. The machine-spirits of this world are long dead.’ But Zale laughed like a daemon, his eyes still burning. Behind her, she heard a sudden, physical struggle, heard the corporal curse. Boots rang on the walkway, there was shouting, then a long, wailing cry as a second figure went over the edge. She did not bother to turn. ‘Mistress.’ The word was a caress. ‘You never learn. How many lives will you throw away? How many more will you send to the Emperor’s glory, before you see the truth? I will not surrender to the torture you call Penitence.’ ‘No more,’ Istrix said. ‘This is over.’ The awful heat yammered at her, searing her now-hairless scalp, hurting her lungs as she breathed it in. But she was stronger than this, better than this. ‘Then shoot me,’ he said to her softly. ‘If you can.’ She raised the bolter. And, with an ear-splitting screech, the gantry fell away beneath both of them. From its orbit of the jungle-planet Lautis, the Imperial frigate Kyrus had turned back to the vacuum of space. Called home by the astropaths, by the tides of the empyrean, it was returning to Ophelia VII, and to the Hallowed Spire of the Convent Sanctorum. Behind the heaviness of the Kyrus’ reinforced bulkheads, securely defended by its void shields and gunnery decks, there lay an empty, decorous hollow, like a hole in its heart. Floored with rockcrete flags, walled with glassaic windows, each one lit by a cunning strip of exterior biolume, this was the ship’s chapel, silent and chill. Neat lines of pews could seat almost a tenth of the Kyrus’ full crew; rows of faces, each man and woman looking up at the altar, and at the broad banner of the aquila that hung above. To one side of that central image hung the winged skull of the Imperial Navy, to the other, the twisting-fish symbol of the Kyrus herself. Flanked by the imagery, lit by the ever-shining glow of the electro-candles, stood the golden stone statue of the God-Emperor. Thirty feet at His Imperial shoulder and framed by the aquila’s wings, He stared out over the nave, His gaze clear, His expression stern. He demanded service. He accepted no compromise. He reminded every one of them of their faith, their courage, their sworn duty. And, from those rows of pews, the crew of the Kyrus could look upon Him, and leave this place uplifted, ready to carry His name out through the warp and to all corners of the Imperium. They would fight and die for Him, to the last man and woman. And they would do so gladly. Now, however, the pews were empty. Under the false vault of the rockcrete roof, the cherubim circled silently, their cold, augmetic gazes eyeing the space below. As the heavy hatchway clunked open, they blinked metal eyelids, recording every movement. A lone figure stepped through. It paused, silent. Bright in the chapel’s lume, its scarlet armour glittered, all ceramite and plasteel. Over this, it bore a black-and-white cloak, decorated with the symbol of the rose; the fabric billowed as it turned to close the hatch. A line of adamantine beads decorated its chaplet and, at its hips, there were slung a Godwyn De’az pattern bolter and a brutal, heavy-duty chainsword. Its – her – head was bare, revealing a stern bob of steel-grey hair and a distinctive tattoo. She said, though there were only the cherubim to hear, ‘In the name of Mina and the Golden Throne, I am the willing daughter of the God-Emperor. I come to listen, and to do His bidding.’ Sister Superior Augusta Santorus touched the fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour, and bowed her head. The cherubim blinked again, their eyelids clicking. As if by their signal, servitors whirred from their resting places. Augusta lifted the bolter from her belt, unclipped the sword, and laid both in the offered brass trays. The soldiers of the Imperial Navy had no requirement to lay down their sidearms, but she, as outlined in the Accords of Deacis VI, entered His presence with humility – bare of weapons, and with her head bared to His light. Slowly, she walked up the aisle. But she did not look up. Since their departure from Lautis, Augusta had visited the chapel often. Not just offering the daily prayers of herself and her squad – and those soldiers of the Navy who’d wished to attend – but at other times, when the hollow was quiet, and she could focus her concentration. Augusta was the commander of her squad, a veteran ­warrior of twenty years’ experience. She had fought battles against xenos, daemon and heretic; she had pursued the foes of mankind to the very edges of space, and she had slain them all. But there was a darkness upon her heart that would not leave her, and that had brought her, once again, into His presence. It defied her comprehension – their previous mission had been a success. Upon Lautis, they had faced a greater daemon, and had banished it back to the warp. They had freed the jungle-planet from the daemon’s cultist followers, and had secured the ruined cathedral for their Order, the Order of the Bloody Rose. The Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priests and servitors arriving aboard the Tukril now held the building safely, and were beginning its reconstruction. The Kyrus had accompanied them, and had waited to assure their security. And now, the old frigate was taking the Sisters back home. Her boots loud in the chapel’s silence, Augusta reached the altar rail. The cherubim followed her movements, sharply watchful. She knelt, her grey bob of hair falling forwards over her face. Though they had defeated it, the Lautis daemon had left her with nightmares. It had infected her thoughts, plagued her dreams with Chaos and Ruin, with images both fearful and bloody. For long Solar weeks after its expulsion, she and the other members of her squad had awoken sweating, and had knelt in midnight prayer… Fortitudo est certa clara meo. My strength must be unfailing, my sight clear. Augusta did not fear the spewed-forth creatures of the warp. Yet Lautis had seen the deaths of two members of her squad – Sister Kimura, in the battle against the orks, and Sister Jatoya, her second and right arm, smashed by the daemon’s axe. Her lips moved in prayer: the Litany of Divine Guidance. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. In twenty long years of battle, Augusta had lost troops before. Her Sisters had been slain, but they had died with courage and honour and they stood now at His feet… Levis est mihi. Show me to the Light. …but her darkness did not diminish. She recalled the words of the cultist’s leader, Subul, the man who had summoned the daemon. ‘I can feel it in you, Sister! I can feel your anger. Let it go. Revel in it! Like your saint before you, like your whole blood-armoured Order, you revel in rage, in the pure fury of the battlefield. You belong here! Lose your foolish faith, and join the darkness!’ For a moment, she dared raise her eyes to Him, framed by the light of the electro-candles… But it was too much. His expression was too austere, His judgement too stern. She was His daughter, her faith and weapons unquestioned, unquestionable; war was her craft and her study. Anger, grief – these were permitted, within proper confines. The loss of her discipline was not. Shamed, she lowered her gaze, back to the gleam of her armour, blood-red against the rockcrete floor. Whatever mission called them, it was His will, and they would praise His name, with hymn and blade and bolter, just as they had always done. We are strong, she told herself. We will not fail. Yet, as she completed her litany and came back to her feet, she wondered at the shadow that still lurked so deep, and at what it may mean for the future.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO The dull throb of the Kyrus’ engines rumbled like a vast heartbeat. It resounded through the metalwork, through the twisting guts and veins of the old ship; as the Sisters prowled forwards, suit-lights glimmering, they could feel it in their boots and their blood. They moved cautiously through the empty corridors, alert for any motion or threat. It was dark down here, and the air was bitterly cold. Over the vox, Sister Melia Kaliyan growled orders. ‘We will progress as far as the junction. Akemi, with me. Viola, Caia, standard skirmishing advance. Maintain your vigilance, Sisters, we do not know what lurks here.’ Bolter in hand, the smallest of the red-armoured figures fell back to Melia’s position, bilgewater sloshing at her ankles. Melia paused to check the squad’s spacing, then used the preysight in her retinal lenses to search for signs of heat, for enemies hiding silently in conduit or crawlspace. But there was nothing. ‘Caia?’ ‘Auspex is clear, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘No motion, no life signs. Even the rats have cleared out.’ Viola muttered, ‘There’ll be something.’ Melia commented softly, ‘Quiet, Sisters. Focus. We have until Compline to complete this mission and return to the Sister Superior.’ ‘Aye.’ The ship’s lumens flickered and fizzed; in front of them, one light sputtered and then died completely, leaving a pool of darkness upon the rippling water. Two of the red-armoured figures moved forwards through it, their skirmish tactics flawless – each one ran ten paces and then splashed down to one knee, covering her comrade as she ran forwards in her turn. Melia watched them, assessing their movements. At the request of the Sister Superior, the captain had cleared his helots and servitors away from this lower deck, but Melia knew, just as Viola did, that there was something waiting for them. Something… She said, ‘Situation report.’ ‘Clear both ways, Sister.’ Viola, her thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands, had taken cover at the right-hand corner of the wall. ‘No motion, no hostiles.’ ‘Caia?’ Covering the junction in the other direction, her auspex bathing her visor in a garish, green light, Caia said, ‘Not as much as a blip. We’re the only things down here.’ ‘Take a full five-second awareness check.’ Melia’s hand tightened on her flamer. ‘There are spaces behind these walls, Sisters, they could be concealing any number of threats – xenos, stowaways, saboteurs.’ Sub-vocal, she counted it down: three, two, one… ‘Very well, we’ll head onwards. Akemi, move up. I’ll take the rear.’ In the vox, Akemi replied, ‘Aye.’ Smoothly, the foremost Sisters moved out to secure the junction. Akemi splashed after them, then ducked back to a kneel as they continued to move. Melia walked at the rear, the filth-strewn water tugging at her feet, her flamer guarding the corridor behind them. She checked over their heads for ladders and walkways, for lurking creatures, for hatches left unsealed… Nothing. Her skin crawled – it couldn’t be this simple. She had to be missing something. But what? ‘Objective sighted,’ Caia’s voice sounded in the vox. ‘Two hundred yards.’ Melia barked, ‘Hold.’ Glancing back over her shoulder, Sister Melia could see it clearly: the glimmer of the pict-screen at the corridor’s far end. But she did not give the order to advance. She said, ‘Eyes open, Sisters.’ More wary than ever, expecting the ambush at any moment, she checked the flickering lights, the overhang of the servitors’ walkway, the line of small, round airlocks that led out to the saviour pods… Still: nothing. What was she missing? The weight of Melia’s new responsibilities sat as unfamiliar to her as the flamer in her hand… Jatoya’s were big boots to fill. The Emperor has called you, she told herself firmly, for the hundredth time. You will offer only thanks for this opportunity to serve Him. Her tone in the vox was firm. ‘Full scan.’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Caia said, again. ‘The corridor’s clear.’ Viola echoed her, ‘Nothing.’ ‘Very well,’ Melia said. ‘We proceed, but slowly. Follow the left-hand wall, Sisters, under line of sight from the walkway. I want every pod-hatch checked.’ ‘Aye.’ Their movements polished, Caia and Viola took the left-hand turn. They headed onwards, and stopped by the first hatch. But Sister Akemi, the youngest of the squad and newly blooded upon Lautis, paused. ‘Akemi?’ Melia’s voice was soft in the vox. Akemi said, ‘There’s something here.’ Instantly Melia barked, ‘Hold!’ Caia and Viola stopped dead. The auspex gleamed green, but its screen remained still. ‘Still nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Not as much as a bilge-rat.’ Viola, both hands on the heavy bolter, twitched a frost-edged pauldron in a shrug. Slowly, Melia turned around, her feet sloshing, her skin crawling with tension. She searched the walls, the hatches, the walkway, the corridors both ahead and behind – the living, twisting guts of the frigate… What was it? What had she not seen? Then Akemi pointed, ‘There!’ ‘Throne!’ The exclamation was out before Melia could stop it. ‘Again?’ And there it was, like a slap to an untrained novice: opposite the nearest hatch, hidden behind a conduit-cover, there was the empty case of a melta bomb. It was almost invisible, painted black, and mag-fastened to the wall. Upon it was inscribed, in Augusta’s stern, cursive hand… ‘BOOM’. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ Melia cursed again, lost her combat stance and slammed the flamer back onto her hip. ‘How did we miss it that time?’ ‘We’re well within the blast radius,’ Akemi commented, ruefully. ‘Motion sensor, triggered as Viola passed – that would have killed all of us.’ ‘Scenario failed.’ Caia’s tone was annoyed, though her ire seemed aimed at herself. She shook the auspex, glaring. Melia let out her breath, frustrated. ‘All right, Sisters, exercise over. Regroup at my location. We’ll put together the report, and join the Sister Superior in the chapel.’ Her armour creaking, Viola came back to her feet, turned around. ‘I went straight past it,’ she said, coming to look at the black metal case. ‘I didn’t even see the thing.’ She glanced at Akemi. ‘How did you know?’ Akemi had plucked the case from the wall mounting and was turning it over. On the bottom, in the same hand, it carried the number four. It was the second one they’d missed. ‘The Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has a pattern. I don’t know if it’s deliberate, but she ambushes us in very similar locations, every time. It’s always at a tension-point, a place where we’re thinking about something else – concentrating on a junction, maybe, on an objective, or on hatches in the wall…’ She tailed off. ‘I think it’s deliberate, and I think it’s a part of her lesson – we’re not down here just to identify a threat.’ ‘Everything has a pattern,’ Caia agreed. ‘Every type of xenos and heretic adheres to its own rules – we just need to know them so we can anticipate. They taught it to us at the schola,’ she turned to Melia. ‘Do you remember? Old Garvia used to say–’ ‘“All things have an Operandus”,’ Melia finished. She took off her helmet, revealing dusky skin and a dark bob of hair, both now glittering with sweat. Her warm breath steamed. ‘“Know it, and your foe’s defeat is assured”.’ She held out her hand for the hollow bomb casing, then crushed it in her armoured fingers. ‘All right, Sisters, we’ll put together the analysis. What we got wrong, and how we can – yes, lieutenant?’ Her tone was startled; the others turned around. Behind them, standing framed by the junction’s jittering lights, a young naval officer stood waiting for their attention. He looked out of place, all the way down here – his uniform was immaculate, and the sludge from the floor was starting to creep up his trouser legs. As Melia turned, however, he gave a perfect fist-to-chest salute. ‘Sisters. I apologise for interrupting your training, but the captain has requested your presence with the utmost urgency, and he does not wish to put this over the vox.’ Surprise flickered through the squad. The others, too, had started to remove their helmets and gazes flashed from Sister to Sister, though they said nothing. ‘For what purpose?’ Melia asked, her tone careful. Looking pained, the young man said, ‘The captain… is in receipt of new orders, Sisters. He needs to relay them personally.’ Viola’s eyebrows shot upwards; Akemi frowned. Melia said, ‘Lieutenant, the captain’s orders came direct from the canon­ess of our Order, from Elvorix Ianthe herself. We’re to return to the Convent Sanctorum.’ ‘Yes, Sister, the captain is aware of this.’ The officer stood bolt-upright, but sounded increasingly apologetic. ‘But those orders have changed.’ He met Melia’s dark gaze, his eyes slightly wide. ‘You’re… wanted by the Inquisition.’ ‘We’re what?’ Pulled from the chapel by a pale-faced aide, Sister Superior Augusta filled the captain’s office with scarlet shoulders and tightly controlled rage. Her expression a thundercloud, she said, ‘Captain Mulier, I trust you’re not accusing my squad…?’ ‘No, Sister, of course not.’ The captain was an older man, with a truly spectacular set of whiskers. Defended by his gold epaulettes and by the heavy weight of his desk, he leaned back, refusing to be intimidated. Beside him, his servo-skull ­hovered silently, its red gaze glittering. ‘A poor choice of words, perhaps.’ He held Augusta’s iron-grey gaze for a moment, then said, ‘Sister Superior. At seventeen hundred hours, Solar time, the Kyrus was in receipt of a ­communication. And that communication was a demand – for our mission parameters, our cargo, and for the full roster of the forces that we carry.’ Augusta continued to glower. ‘That information is surely classified.’ ‘Of course,’ the captain said. ‘But the demand came with an Inquisition signature. And when your name was mentioned, the inquisitor immediately commandeered your presence. She has a mission that… necessitates your assistance.’ ‘Captain.’ Augusta’s voice held the faintest edge. ‘I am under orders from my canoness.’ But the captain was not backing down. ‘Sister,’ he said. ‘We are – you are – under orders from the Inquisition.’ Caught, she said nothing – an inquisitor had the rank to command any force or cooperation they required, including the obedience of a planetary governor, or of the Adeptus Astartes. And, captain or no, it would not be proper to show an emotional reaction to a member of the Imperial Navy. She allowed herself the luxury of rattling her gauntleted fingers on the butt of her bolter. ‘Did she detail the mission, captain?’ ‘She did not.’ The man was still looking up at her, his whiskers bristling. ‘She merely issued the command. We’ve been given new coordinates, Sister – we’re adjusting our plasma drives now.’ His words made her notice the change in the ship’s engines, the ever-present throb intensifying as the million-ton weight of the Kyrus turned with slow dignity, like some vast creature. Augusta said, ‘Our new destination?’ ‘Sister–’ A sharp, metallic knock interrupted his answer. He raised his voice. ‘Enter!’ A young officer pushed the hatch open, and immediately stepped back to allow four more armoured figures into the room – Augusta’s squad, helmets off and weapons slung. Melia caught her gaze, and gave her a brief nod – their training had been completed – then came to stand at her side, feet apart, hands behind her back, helmet mag-locked to her hip. The other three stopped a pace back, their stances identical. Their frost-rimed armour still radiated the chill of the lower decks; the small room was suddenly filled with the glitter of ceramite. Each purity seal caught the lumens and gleamed like a statement of faith, each merit-bead like one of accomplishment. And each face was perfectly schooled, both stern and proficient. Sister Melia Kaliyan, now second-in-command. Augusta had been unsure about Melia’s confidence in her new role, but Melia had faced the challenge with no visible doubt in either herself or her abilities. Sister Caia de Musa, Melia’s closest friend through the schola. Tall and bronze-haired, her auspex always to hand, her gaze was razor-sharp, and she missed little. Sister Viola Taenaris, freckled and red-haired, with a noted streak of wilfulness. Her insubordination upon Lautis had cost Viola her single merit-bead – only the extremity of the situation had prevented her from making the trip back in the Kyrus’ brig. And Sister Akemi Hirari, the squad’s newest and youngest, her skin pale and her hair shining black. Akemi had almost taken her vows to the Order of the Quill, and her lore surpassed that of all her Sisters combined. Upon their previous mission, it had been Akemi’s insight that had enabled them to banish the daemon. Looking at them, Augusta felt her heart lift, felt it flush with faith and light. She gave them an approving nod and turned back to the desk, offering silent thanks to the Emperor Himself for her squad’s solidity. Her darkness was nothing, and it shamed her. Shamed them. ‘Sisters, thank you for attending.’ Respectfully, the captain came to his feet, his gaze travelling from one face to the next. ‘I understand that your training was not to be interrupted, but the situation is critical. Dismissed, lieutenant.’ The young officer saluted, then stepped back through the door and pulled it closed. There was the metal rattle of the hatch seal. Augusta said, ‘We are close to Compline, captain. Please, proceed.’ ‘Sister Superior, Sisters Militant.’ He picked up his data-slate, waited as its glassy surface flowed with text. Then, with a sigh as though he were bracing himself, he said, ‘The orders I have received read as follows. “Effective immediately, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus of the Order of the Bloody Rose is to relinquish all prior mission instructions. She is to muster her squad, and to report to the following coordinates. A full deployment of weapons and battlegear will be expected. A full brief will be issued upon landing. Ave Imperator.”’ He turned the slate to show them. ‘It’s signed with Inquisitor Istrix’s personal seal.’ Viola muttered; Augusta silenced her with a sharp look. Melia asked, her velvet voice cool, ‘What are these coordinates, captain? We should at least know where we’re bound.’ The captain sat down and laid the slate back on the desk, giving himself time. After a moment, he said, ‘This is a quiet corner of the void, Sister – something of a rarity. And the Kyrus is an older ship, her armaments unsuitable for heavy combat. When the Tukril was deployed to Lautis, we were deemed… enough… to accompany her.’ Augusta studied him, wondering where this was going. He said, ‘I would guess that we’re the only Imperial ship within reach.’ Melia said, voice soft with danger, ‘Reach of what?’ The captain turned to the pict-screen behind him, let its surface flow with an image – a single, reddening star, a single, ringed planet. He said, ‘There is a Class Four star three Solar days from here, Sister, that has a solitary, satellite world.’ The screen moved, closing its focus upon the planet itself. ‘It’s known to the ships of the region as a place to avoid. Some even call it notorious.’ Melia frowned at the word; the other three shifted, their armour scraping. The captain continued, ‘My orders, however, do not include the luxury of either speculation or avoidance. These coordinates will take you to Imperial Munitorum depot eight-nine-zero-point-four-five, upon the surface of the planet Lycheate.’ Augusta blinked – the name meant nothing to her. ‘Permission to speak, Sister.’ The voice was Akemi’s. ‘Granted.’ She said, ‘Captain. “Lycheate” meaning… industrial waste?’ ‘That’s as good a description as any,’ the captain said. ‘Lycheate is local slang, a nickname – your map would name the world Vastum.’ The pict-screen shifted, closing focus upon the planet. ‘It was a forge world, founded during the Age of Redemption by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Its considerable output helped fuel the Macharian Conquest, among other things.’ ‘But no longer?’ Augusta said. She’d felt the others tense – they’d already had one experience with long-dead machinery, though it had come from a very different time. Melia indicated the planet’s encircling ellipsis. ‘What is the ring, captain? Debris? Or defence?’ ‘Three hundred years ago,’ the captain said, ‘Lycheate had more than twenty moons, the largest of them barely two thousand miles across. They were finally stripped of all their resources when the Iron Duke Glevan stormed Bastoom.’ His smile was grim. ‘But you know the Mechanicus, they never waste anything. The moons were detonated at their cores to ensure that every last scrap of ore could be stripped for the war effort. The more valuable fragments were towed–’ ‘And the rest now orbit the planet,’ Melia said. ‘A ring of wreckage.’ ‘Just so, Sister.’ The screen closed in further, focusing on the fragments. Augusta could feel Akemi shifting, committing the images to memory. ‘There’s something you’re omitting, captain,’ Augusta said. ‘Why is this world to be avoided, if it’s so long dead?’ ‘The world is far from dead, sadly,’ the captain said. ‘Only the spirits of the machines themselves.’ His smile was mirthless. ‘I regret to inform you, Sisters, that Lycheate is very much alive. ‘And our first problem will be getting you to the surface.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO The dull throb of the Kyrus’ engines rumbled like a vast heartbeat. It resounded through the metalwork, through the twisting guts and veins of the old ship; as the Sisters prowled forwards, suit-lights glimmering, they could feel it in their boots and their blood. They moved cautiously through the empty corridors, alert for any motion or threat. It was dark down here, and the air was bitterly cold. Over the vox, Sister Melia Kaliyan growled orders. ‘We will progress as far as the junction. Akemi, with me. Viola, Caia, standard skirmishing advance. Maintain your vigilance, Sisters, we do not know what lurks here.’ Bolter in hand, the smallest of the red-armoured figures fell back to Melia’s position, bilgewater sloshing at her ankles. Melia paused to check the squad’s spacing, then used the preysight in her retinal lenses to search for signs of heat, for enemies hiding silently in conduit or crawlspace. But there was nothing. ‘Caia?’ ‘Auspex is clear, Sister,’ Caia said. ‘No motion, no life signs. Even the rats have cleared out.’ Viola muttered, ‘There’ll be something.’ Melia commented softly, ‘Quiet, Sisters. Focus. We have until Compline to complete this mission and return to the Sister Superior.’ ‘Aye.’ The ship’s lumens flickered and fizzed; in front of them, one light sputtered and then died completely, leaving a pool of darkness upon the rippling water. Two of the red-armoured figures moved forwards through it, their skirmish tactics flawless – each one ran ten paces and then splashed down to one knee, covering her comrade as she ran forwards in her turn. Melia watched them, assessing their movements. At the request of the Sister Superior, the captain had cleared his helots and servitors away from this lower deck, but Melia knew, just as Viola did, that there was something waiting for them. Something… She said, ‘Situation report.’ ‘Clear both ways, Sister.’ Viola, her thrice-blessed heavy bolter in both hands, had taken cover at the right-hand corner of the wall. ‘No motion, no hostiles.’ ‘Caia?’ Covering the junction in the other direction, her auspex bathing her visor in a garish, green light, Caia said, ‘Not as much as a blip. We’re the only things down here.’ ‘Take a full five-second awareness check.’ Melia’s hand tightened on her flamer. ‘There are spaces behind these walls, Sisters, they could be concealing any number of threats – xenos, stowaways, saboteurs.’ Sub-vocal, she counted it down: three, two, one… ‘Very well, we’ll head onwards. Akemi, move up. I’ll take the rear.’ In the vox, Akemi replied, ‘Aye.’ Smoothly, the foremost Sisters moved out to secure the junction. Akemi splashed after them, then ducked back to a kneel as they continued to move. Melia walked at the rear, the filth-strewn water tugging at her feet, her flamer guarding the corridor behind them. She checked over their heads for ladders and walkways, for lurking creatures, for hatches left unsealed… Nothing. Her skin crawled – it couldn’t be this simple. She had to be missing something. But what? ‘Objective sighted,’ Caia’s voice sounded in the vox. ‘Two hundred yards.’ Melia barked, ‘Hold.’ Glancing back over her shoulder, Sister Melia could see it clearly: the glimmer of the pict-screen at the corridor’s far end. But she did not give the order to advance. She said, ‘Eyes open, Sisters.’ More wary than ever, expecting the ambush at any moment, she checked the flickering lights, the overhang of the servitors’ walkway, the line of small, round airlocks that led out to the saviour pods… Still: nothing. What was she missing? The weight of Melia’s new responsibilities sat as unfamiliar to her as the flamer in her hand… Jatoya’s were big boots to fill. The Emperor has called you, she told herself firmly, for the hundredth time. You will offer only thanks for this opportunity to serve Him. Her tone in the vox was firm. ‘Full scan.’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Caia said, again. ‘The corridor’s clear.’ Viola echoed her, ‘Nothing.’ ‘Very well,’ Melia said. ‘We proceed, but slowly. Follow the left-hand wall, Sisters, under line of sight from the walkway. I want every pod-hatch checked.’ ‘Aye.’ Their movements polished, Caia and Viola took the left-hand turn. They headed onwards, and stopped by the first hatch. But Sister Akemi, the youngest of the squad and newly blooded upon Lautis, paused. ‘Akemi?’ Melia’s voice was soft in the vox. Akemi said, ‘There’s something here.’ Instantly Melia barked, ‘Hold!’ Caia and Viola stopped dead. The auspex gleamed green, but its screen remained still. ‘Still nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Not as much as a bilge-rat.’ Viola, both hands on the heavy bolter, twitched a frost-edged pauldron in a shrug. Slowly, Melia turned around, her feet sloshing, her skin crawling with tension. She searched the walls, the hatches, the walkway, the corridors both ahead and behind – the living, twisting guts of the frigate… What was it? What had she not seen? Then Akemi pointed, ‘There!’ ‘Throne!’ The exclamation was out before Melia could stop it. ‘Again?’ And there it was, like a slap to an untrained novice: opposite the nearest hatch, hidden behind a conduit-cover, there was the empty case of a melta bomb. It was almost invisible, painted black, and mag-fastened to the wall. Upon it was inscribed, in Augusta’s stern, cursive hand… ‘BOOM’. ‘Dominica’s eyes!’ Melia cursed again, lost her combat stance and slammed the flamer back onto her hip. ‘How did we miss it that time?’ ‘We’re well within the blast radius,’ Akemi commented, ruefully. ‘Motion sensor, triggered as Viola passed – that would have killed all of us.’ ‘Scenario failed.’ Caia’s tone was annoyed, though her ire seemed aimed at herself. She shook the auspex, glaring. Melia let out her breath, frustrated. ‘All right, Sisters, exercise over. Regroup at my location. We’ll put together the report, and join the Sister Superior in the chapel.’ Her armour creaking, Viola came back to her feet, turned around. ‘I went straight past it,’ she said, coming to look at the black metal case. ‘I didn’t even see the thing.’ She glanced at Akemi. ‘How did you know?’ Akemi had plucked the case from the wall mounting and was turning it over. On the bottom, in the same hand, it carried the number four. It was the second one they’d missed. ‘The Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has a pattern. I don’t know if it’s deliberate, but she ambushes us in very similar locations, every time. It’s always at a tension-point, a place where we’re thinking about something else – concentrating on a junction, maybe, on an objective, or on hatches in the wall…’ She tailed off. ‘I think it’s deliberate, and I think it’s a part of her lesson – we’re not down here just to identify a threat.’ ‘Everything has a pattern,’ Caia agreed. ‘Every type of xenos and heretic adheres to its own rules – we just need to know them so we can anticipate. They taught it to us at the schola,’ she turned to Melia. ‘Do you remember? Old Garvia used to say–’ ‘“All things have an Operandus”,’ Melia finished. She took off her helmet, revealing dusky skin and a dark bob of hair, both now glittering with sweat. Her warm breath steamed. ‘“Know it, and your foe’s defeat is assured”.’ She held out her hand for the hollow bomb casing, then crushed it in her armoured fingers. ‘All right, Sisters, we’ll put together the analysis. What we got wrong, and how we can – yes, lieutenant?’ Her tone was startled; the others turned around. Behind them, standing framed by the junction’s jittering lights, a young naval officer stood waiting for their attention. He looked out of place, all the way down here – his uniform was immaculate, and the sludge from the floor was starting to creep up his trouser legs. As Melia turned, however, he gave a perfect fist-to-chest salute. ‘Sisters. I apologise for interrupting your training, but the captain has requested your presence with the utmost urgency, and he does not wish to put this over the vox.’ Surprise flickered through the squad. The others, too, had started to remove their helmets and gazes flashed from Sister to Sister, though they said nothing. ‘For what purpose?’ Melia asked, her tone careful. Looking pained, the young man said, ‘The captain… is in receipt of new orders, Sisters. He needs to relay them personally.’ Viola’s eyebrows shot upwards; Akemi frowned. Melia said, ‘Lieutenant, the captain’s orders came direct from the canon­ess of our Order, from Elvorix Ianthe herself. We’re to return to the Convent Sanctorum.’ ‘Yes, Sister, the captain is aware of this.’ The officer stood bolt-upright, but sounded increasingly apologetic. ‘But those orders have changed.’ He met Melia’s dark gaze, his eyes slightly wide. ‘You’re… wanted by the Inquisition.’ ‘We’re what?’ Pulled from the chapel by a pale-faced aide, Sister Superior Augusta filled the captain’s office with scarlet shoulders and tightly controlled rage. Her expression a thundercloud, she said, ‘Captain Mulier, I trust you’re not accusing my squad…?’ ‘No, Sister, of course not.’ The captain was an older man, with a truly spectacular set of whiskers. Defended by his gold epaulettes and by the heavy weight of his desk, he leaned back, refusing to be intimidated. Beside him, his servo-skull ­hovered silently, its red gaze glittering. ‘A poor choice of words, perhaps.’ He held Augusta’s iron-grey gaze for a moment, then said, ‘Sister Superior. At seventeen hundred hours, Solar time, the Kyrus was in receipt of a ­communication. And that communication was a demand – for our mission parameters, our cargo, and for the full roster of the forces that we carry.’ Augusta continued to glower. ‘That information is surely classified.’ ‘Of course,’ the captain said. ‘But the demand came with an Inquisition signature. And when your name was mentioned, the inquisitor immediately commandeered your presence. She has a mission that… necessitates your assistance.’ ‘Captain.’ Augusta’s voice held the faintest edge. ‘I am under orders from my canoness.’ But the captain was not backing down. ‘Sister,’ he said. ‘We are – you are – under orders from the Inquisition.’ Caught, she said nothing – an inquisitor had the rank to command any force or cooperation they required, including the obedience of a planetary governor, or of the Adeptus Astartes. And, captain or no, it would not be proper to show an emotional reaction to a member of the Imperial Navy. She allowed herself the luxury of rattling her gauntleted fingers on the butt of her bolter. ‘Did she detail the mission, captain?’ ‘She did not.’ The man was still looking up at her, his whiskers bristling. ‘She merely issued the command. We’ve been given new coordinates, Sister – we’re adjusting our plasma drives now.’ His words made her notice the change in the ship’s engines, the ever-present throb intensifying as the million-ton weight of the Kyrus turned with slow dignity, like some vast creature. Augusta said, ‘Our new destination?’ ‘Sister–’ A sharp, metallic knock interrupted his answer. He raised his voice. ‘Enter!’ A young officer pushed the hatch open, and immediately stepped back to allow four more armoured figures into the room – Augusta’s squad, helmets off and weapons slung. Melia caught her gaze, and gave her a brief nod – their training had been completed – then came to stand at her side, feet apart, hands behind her back, helmet mag-locked to her hip. The other three stopped a pace back, their stances identical. Their frost-rimed armour still radiated the chill of the lower decks; the small room was suddenly filled with the glitter of ceramite. Each purity seal caught the lumens and gleamed like a statement of faith, each merit-bead like one of accomplishment. And each face was perfectly schooled, both stern and proficient. Sister Melia Kaliyan, now second-in-command. Augusta had been unsure about Melia’s confidence in her new role, but Melia had faced the challenge with no visible doubt in either herself or her abilities. Sister Caia de Musa, Melia’s closest friend through the schola. Tall and bronze-haired, her auspex always to hand, her gaze was razor-sharp, and she missed little. Sister Viola Taenaris, freckled and red-haired, with a noted streak of wilfulness. Her insubordination upon Lautis had cost Viola her single merit-bead – only the extremity of the situation had prevented her from making the trip back in the Kyrus’ brig. And Sister Akemi Hirari, the squad’s newest and youngest, her skin pale and her hair shining black. Akemi had almost taken her vows to the Order of the Quill, and her lore surpassed that of all her Sisters combined. Upon their previous mission, it had been Akemi’s insight that had enabled them to banish the daemon. Looking at them, Augusta felt her heart lift, felt it flush with faith and light. She gave them an approving nod and turned back to the desk, offering silent thanks to the Emperor Himself for her squad’s solidity. Her darkness was nothing, and it shamed her. Shamed them. ‘Sisters, thank you for attending.’ Respectfully, the captain came to his feet, his gaze travelling from one face to the next. ‘I understand that your training was not to be interrupted, but the situation is critical. Dismissed, lieutenant.’ The young officer saluted, then stepped back through the door and pulled it closed. There was the metal rattle of the hatch seal. Augusta said, ‘We are close to Compline, captain. Please, proceed.’ ‘Sister Superior, Sisters Militant.’ He picked up his data-slate, waited as its glassy surface flowed with text. Then, with a sigh as though he were bracing himself, he said, ‘The orders I have received read as follows. “Effective immediately, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus of the Order of the Bloody Rose is to relinquish all prior mission instructions. She is to muster her squad, and to report to the following coordinates. A full deployment of weapons and battlegear will be expected. A full brief will be issued upon landing.

Melia asked, her velvet voice cool, ‘What are these coordinates, captain? We should at least know where we’re bound.’ The captain sat down and laid the slate back on the desk, giving himself time. After a moment, he said, ‘This is a quiet corner of the void, Sister – something of a rarity. And the Kyrus is an older ship, her armaments unsuitable for heavy combat. When the Tukril was deployed to Lautis, we were deemed… enough… to accompany her.’ Augusta studied him, wondering where this was going. He said, ‘I would guess that we’re the only Imperial ship within reach.’ Melia said, voice soft with danger, ‘Reach of what?’ The captain turned to the pict-screen behind him, let its surface flow with an image – a single, reddening star, a single, ringed planet. He said, ‘There is a Class Four star three Solar days from here, Sister, that has a solitary, satellite world.’ The screen moved, closing its focus upon the planet itself. ‘It’s known to the ships of the region as a place to avoid. Some even call it notorious.’ Melia frowned at the word; the other three shifted, their armour scraping. The captain continued, ‘My orders, however, do not include the luxury of either speculation or avoidance. These coordinates will take you to Imperial Munitorum depot eight-nine-zero-point-four-five, upon the surface of the planet Lycheate.’ Augusta blinked – the name meant nothing to her. ‘Permission to speak, Sister.’ The voice was Akemi’s. ‘Granted.’ She said, ‘Captain. “Lycheate” meaning… industrial waste?’ ‘That’s as good a description as any,’ the captain said. ‘Lycheate is local slang, a nickname – your map would name the world Vastum.’ The pict-screen shifted, closing focus upon the planet. ‘It was a forge world, founded during the Age of Redemption by the Adeptus Mechanicus. Its considerable output helped fuel the Macharian Conquest, among other things.’ ‘But no longer?’ Augusta said. She’d felt the others tense – they’d already had one experience with long-dead machinery, though it had come from a very different time. Melia indicated the planet’s encircling ellipsis. ‘What is the ring, captain? Debris?

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE In the back of the Aquila-class shuttle, the vox-grille crackled into life. ‘…ist… zzz… assist… urg…’ The five members of Augusta’s squad were seated in the old landing craft, each one fully armoured, and strapped into her chair. The shuttle was battered, its hangings and its dignitaries’ throne long since removed. It had tiny, double-layered glassaic windowpanes, and, above their heads, the observation dome was long since welded shut. Wherever this craft had been, it’d had more adventures than simply delivering persons of importance to critical locations. Melia, sitting beside Augusta in the front row, leaned forwards. ‘Pilot? Can we investigate that signal?’ The pilot’s voice came back over the vox-grille, her tone politely firm. ‘We’re about to enter the planet’s debris field, Sister,’ she said, ‘and our course is very tightly plotted. If we’re to make planetfall in time for your briefing, we can’t be making side trips.’ Melia sat back, her expression closed. The squad’s new second was Hospitaller trained, had spent time with the Order of Serenity, and she had a unique streak of compassion that was both a blessing and a nuisance. Augusta understood her concerns, but the squad was under orders. ‘Sister,’ she said. ‘You have never encountered the Inquisition, but believe me, we will need to arrive promptly.’ Melia glanced at her, her expression a question. Augusta said, raising her voice a little so the others could hear, ‘Only once, and only briefly – Inquisitor Tuccius and his storm troopers came to the planet Lyca, investigating the High Deacon. They wield fear like a weapon, authority like a banner – they answer to the Emperor alone. I know nothing of Istrix herself, but she is the holy servant of the Emperor, His will made manifest, and our service to her is an honour.’ Melia said, ‘Aye, Sister,’ and sat back, murmuring a prayer. The vox-grille crackled again. ‘Approaching the debris field now. Be warned, Sisters, this could get rough.’ The engines fired and slowed. Augusta touched a hand to the front of her armour, breathing the words of the litany. ‘By the Light!’ The awed whisper was Akemi. They all turned. Below them, the planet Lycheate lay waiting, the haze-blur of its atmosphere a dirty, reddish-brown. To their left, its star was sullen, red and swollen with vast age. But it was not the star, nor its satellite, that had caught the squad’s attention. Outside the shuttle, the first of the moon-pieces was now coming past them, a slow and silent tumble of shattered rock. It was oddly serene; a turning of glitter and angle, of dark, crystalline colours all frosted with cold. And soon, there were hundreds of them. Thousands. The Sisters sat staring, their breaths taken away. As they passed, many of the fragments offered hints of their previous life – of the frozen edges of mine workings, of scaffold and steel, of vox-antennae and torn-open habitat. There was industry wreckage, like the shattered splinters of the great machine-spirit, all snapped and broken, its pieces still reaching out to the vacuum. Augusta could almost imagine the moons’ endings, that silent boom of slow motion detonations, one after another, the spiralling of the pieces forming the ring that now orbited this lost Mechanicus world. It was a reminder of the Emperor’s power, of His grace and strength, of His great might that spanned the vastness of space. The shuttle slowed. Its engines fired as it curved carefully from side to side. Still watching, Augusta offered her voice in a Requiem. Around her, the others lent their song to hers – Melia’s velvet contralto, Akemi’s pure, clear harmony. ‘Dies Irae, Dies Illa! Solvet saeclum in favilla!’ The Day of Wrath! That day will dissolve the world in ashes! The Sister Superior shivered. Under her vambraces, the hair on her forearms was standing on end. The grille crackled again, shattering the moment. ‘Pleazzz… assist… oxy… deplet… hours…’ ‘In the Emperor’s name,’ Melia said softly. ‘There can’t still be workers out there!’ ‘Ignore it, Sister.’ The voice was the pilot, her tone still firm. Melia sat upright, her expression hardening. ‘Pilot–’ ‘Sister,’ Augusta said. A larger piece of moon loomed close to the window, a gleam of tram-lines clearly visible. ‘Let the pilot focus. We must attain the surface safely, and without delay.’ The words were a warning, and Melia fell silent. But the vox-grille still crackled, the voice now tightening with panic. It was offering coordinates, the numbers broken by the spit and fizzle of the star’s radiation, and by the spin of the passing rock. ‘That’s close,’ Caia said, checking her auspex. ‘Those coordinates are–’ ‘It’s not a distress call.’ The pilot’s interruption was curt. Melia stared at the vox-grille. ‘What?’ Augusta was studying the silent dance outside, watching the edges of the rocks as they slowly sailed past. The one at the window had gone, revealing a longer view – and a silhouette of familiar shapes. A line of titanic gun-muzzles, now covering the debris field. They turned, tracking the Aquila as it passed. ‘Hold on!’ The voice was the pilot’s, suddenly sharp. The old shuttle banked hard, into a turn; Augusta’s belly lurched. The engines whined and strained; their noise burrowed in her ears like a bloodworm. Outside the window, the moon-pieces pitched abruptly sideways and were gone. Gripping the arms of the chair, she leaned back, exhaling more of the hymn. ‘Imperator majistatis, Qui salvandos salvas gratis, Salva nos, fons pietatis!’ Emperor of majesty, Who saves those who are to be saved, Save us, O fount of mercy! ‘Keep holding!’ The pilot spoke again, her tone tight. With a rush, the vehicle banked further, turning right over; the fragments outside were suddenly way too close for comfort. The Sister Superior tightened her grip, still praying. She had no fear of dying in battle – weapons in hands and praising Him – but this, this sudden threat of a cold and unmarked doom… This was not something she could control, and she disliked it intensely. The vox-grille spoke again. ‘The signal is an automation, Sisters, calculated to lure unwary transports. If the defences don’t kill us, then the collision probably will. And the pieces can be picked up by the pirates.’ The pilot’s voice spat and sputtered with electricity and tension. ‘With the Emperor’s blessing, we should clear the debris field in about four– And again.’ The Aquila banked the other way, throwing Augusta sideways in the seat. She could feel the shuttle’s engines as the vehicle twisted and shuddered, hear them straining, higher and lighter than those of the frigate. They hummed in protest as it turned past another huge fragment of rock. Drawing in her breath, she murmured further lines of the Requiem, the sound blending harmoniously with the engines’ song. ‘Confutatis maledictis, Fammis acribus addictis Voca me com benedictis!’ Once the accursed have been silenced, Sentenced to acrid flames, Call me thus with the blessed! ‘Four minutes,’ Viola said, her tone biting. ‘I thought Captain Mulier said the emplacements were abandoned?’ ‘Not all of them,’ Akemi answered her. ‘When the Mechanicus withdrew from Lycheate, they must have armed the debris ring to keep the planet secure. It seems their emplacements have been repurposed.’ ‘But there’s no gravity, no reactors, no nothing,’ Caia said, looking out at the pieces. ‘How can anything live out here?’ ‘They’re probably controlled from the surface,’ Akemi said. ‘They…’ She stopped as one of the visible emplacements suddenly blossomed with globular flame. A red streak came hard across the darkness; the whole vessel shook as it banked for a fourth turn. The Sisters could almost feel the missile as it streaked beneath the agile lander’s belly, then detonated on the rock beyond. More fragments tumbled, tiny pieces newly broken. ‘That one wasn’t automated,’ Caia said. ‘That targeted the engines.’ She raised her voice to speak into the grille, ‘Can we return fire, pilot?’ ‘I’d rather not, Sister,’ the pilot said, her tone sharp. ‘We’re not armed for a fight. Better we just get out of here, and into the atmosphere proper. Once we’re through the debris-ring, this should get easier.’ ‘Let them concentrate, Sister,’ Augusta said, again. Her tone was sharper than she’d meant it, and she made an effort to speak with proper control. ‘This is not our task. We will place our trust in the God-Emperor, in the spirit of this landing craft, and in its pilot, who does His work.’ She ended the Requiem and began to murmur the more familiar words of the litany, and felt the others join her. Felt them steady. From the lightning and the tempest… As if it had heard them, the vehicle returned again to a level flight path, and Augusta felt her belly-tension ease. Beside her, Melia blew out her breath; the others sat back, began to relax. The last of the pieces of rock sailed slowly past the windows, and were gone. Beneath them now, the planet gleamed like rust. Engines firing, the Aquila picked up speed. Soon, they felt the bounce and judder as the shuttle penetrated the outer atmosphere. And slowly, a glittering arc of light to the eyes of the planet below, it began its descent. ‘Sister. Superior. Augusta. Santorus.’ Inquisitor Istrix pronounced each word like a passing of her judgement, chill and merciless. ‘Your closeness to my location must be the Will of the Emperor Himself.’ Her faintly acerbic tone echoed in the empty metal shelving that surrounded them, in the corrosion of centuries that stretched upwards to an unseen ceiling. With its loading bay doors now closed, the old Munitorum depot was large enough to have accommodated the ­Aquila’s landing, small enough to be secure, and secure enough to be guarded by whatever force Istrix had brought with her. Privately, Augusta complimented the inquisitor on her choice of briefing location – there was little that could reach them in here. Aloud, however, the Sister Superior said nothing. She and her squad stood at parade ground attention: feet together, hands at their sides, their gazes clear and straight ahead. In her black armour and grey robes, Istrix barely came up to Augusta’s nose, yet the mantle of her authority was tangible. She eyed them critically, one after another. Her odd, pale green gaze took in the scars on their armour left by the Lautis daemons, the purity seals, the merit-beads, the elaborate filigree work on Viola’s thrice-blessed heavy bolter. She looked like she was ticking them off a list. ‘The Order of the Bloody Rose,’ she continued, her words still heavily weighted. ‘Followers of Saint Mina. One of the younger militant Orders, and founded by Deacis IV. Your Order have quite the martial reputation, Sister Superior, ferocious with both faith and blade. Is this true?’ ‘Emperor willing, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, still staring straight ahead. Istrix nodded. ‘Good. Your courage becomes you.’ At the inquisitor’s shoulder, there stood a tall young man, his gear Militarum issue, all green and beige, his skin rich and dark. His brassard bore two stripes, but scars and dirt had obscured his regimental insignia. From the state of his kit, he looked like he’d been here for some time. ‘I know your canoness,’ Istrix said. She made no attempt to explain the comment, but went on, ‘Captain Mulier will convey to her my orders. Down here, securing off-planet communication can be… challenging.’ She gave a small, cold smile. ‘It is possible, but it requires either force, or coin. And until recently, my presence has been… necessarily discreet.’ The corporal kept his eyes on his boots. ‘Very well, Sisters,’ Istrix said. ‘At ease. And listen up.’ The inquisitor’s briefing was curt. Lycheate, she told them, was a sewer; a filthy, seething sump-hive of a world. The planet’s surface was ninety-five per cent water, now heavily polluted with the effluvium of centuries. Over it had been built vast ferrocrete and flex­steel platforms, supporting the endless, methodical grids of Mechanicus machines – furnaces, regulators, incinerators. They stretched for thousands of miles, a planet-wide city of industry and labour, once teeming with servitors and tech-priests alike. But, the Mechanicus had gone. With the moons destroyed, they’d taken everything else of value, spoken the last rites of the Omnissiah, and they’d left Lycheate to die. And yet, Istrix had said, no corner of the Imperium was ever free from the ingenuity of the determined heretic. Some two hundred years before, the cargo scow Egestes had proven itself too curious, and had skimmed just too close. Damaged by the debris field, it had crash-landed upon the planet’s surface. And so, Lycheate’s new life had begun. The scow had been carrying the Questor Heretek Vius, and his multiple servitors and helots. And Vius had been curious about what he’d discovered – he had determined to scour every last inch of this world for its lost machinery and data-ghosts. Under Vius’ relentless, methodical direction, his minions had spread out across the planet, exploring, seeking, repurposing. They’d breathed just enough new life into the last sparks of the fusion reactor; they’d found habitats still intact, infrastructure still usable. And the vox-antennae could be repaired, and repurposed. ‘Come to me,’ Vius had said, his datastream reaching out across the void. ‘Come to me, and I will offer you a new beginning.’ The Sisters had listened to Istrix’s clipped, meticulous tones, watched the shadows as they passed across the face of the corporal – he seemed barely more than a boy. Augusta eyed his youth, and his battered kit, and wondered what he was doing here. Istrix said, ‘Have you ever encountered a renegade world, Sisters? A world where the Light of the Emperor has been not only lost, but wantonly abandoned?’ The question was rhetorical; she continued to speak. ‘You wonder why this world has not been purged, and I tell you – its day of reckoning will come. For now, however, its existence will be tolerated, as it conceals a greater prize.’ The corporal’s expression flickered, though his stance did not falter. Glancing at him, Istrix said, ‘Corporal Mors is a young man of very great courage. He has seen his squad slain around him, screaming with fear, and he has stood fast. He has earned your respect, Sisters. And this world must do likewise. You will not walk out of here and open fire – you will run out of ammunition long before you run out of targets. Do I make myself clear? Any cleansing will come only when I speak the word.’ The chill in her voice was cracking at the edges, though Augusta could not tell why. In the Sister Superior’s ear, her vox-bead fizzled as a channel opened, but whichever Sister had been going to speak thought better of it, and said nothing. ‘Yes, ma’am,’ Augusta said. ‘Perfectly clear.’ ‘I’m glad to hear it,’ Istrix told her. Again, that touch of acerbity, of bleak, cold humour. ‘For now, we are secure – my shuttle is secured here, and this compound and its immediate surround are safe. But once we leave this location, my resources are few. Lycheate is a lawless world, Sisters – a world of pirate and trader and ganger, of human and xenos, of cultist and witch and psyker. There is no Ecclesiarchy here, no governor. No neat chimes to mark the hours.’ Her face was sharp, narrow as a hatchet. ‘Here, the order is one of power, of wit and money, of force and reputation. And much as I have tried to remain unremarkable, my life has already been attempted several times.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘Needless to say, those attempts have been thwarted. With you at my back, however, I can employ a somewhat more… forceful… approach.’ She fell silent, almost as if she was thinking. Augusta said, ‘A question, inquisitor.’ Istrix nodded, and the Sister Superior said, ‘What is it that you pursue?’ What is so important that you spare this world to find it? The inquisitor paused, her oddly pale eyes narrowing. ‘You ask me why I permit this world its miserable life?’ Again, the same, cold smile. ‘Your reputation is not unearned, Sister Superior.’ From somewhere, there came the whoosh of hydraulics, the sound of shouts and lasgun fire. Screaming. Viola twitched, put a hand to the heavy bolter, but the noises soon faded again. The inquisitor said, ‘How would you feel, Sister, if you were betrayed by one of your squad?’ Augusta blinked – the question had caught her out. It was shocking, unthinkable, verging almost on blasphemous. And there was no answer that she could make that was not an outright refusal to accept the inquisitor’s words – and the breach of her orders would be severe. She said, ‘Ma’am?’ Istrix tapped the bolter at her hip. ‘My target,’ she said, ‘is a man called Scafidis Zale. He is a witch, a heretic, and a reminder of my ultimate failure.’ Her skin flushed faintly, showing a latticework of recent scars – the marks both regular and deliberate. ‘He was my interrogator until his… ability… became manifest. And he refused the path that the Emperor had chosen for him.’ Something in her gaze glittered like the ice of the debris-field. ‘And in the name of Terra itself, I will end him personally.’ The final word made an odd chill go down Augusta’s back. But this was the Inquisition – and it was not her place to disobey.",

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE In the back of the Aquila-class shuttle, the vox-grille crackled into life. ‘…ist… zzz… assist… urg…’ The five members of Augusta’s squad were seated in the old landing craft, each one fully armoured, and strapped into her chair. The shuttle was battered, its hangings and its dignitaries’ throne long since removed. It had tiny, double-layered glassaic windowpanes, and, above their heads, the observation dome was long since welded shut. Wherever this craft had been, it’d had more adventures than simply delivering persons of importance to critical locations. Melia, sitting beside Augusta in the front row, leaned forwards. ‘Pilot? Can we investigate that signal?’ The pilot’s voice came back over the vox-grille, her tone politely firm. ‘We’re about to enter the planet’s debris field, Sister,’ she said, ‘and our course is very tightly plotted. If we’re to make planetfall in time for your briefing, we can’t be making side trips.’ Melia sat back, her expression closed. The squad’s new second was Hospitaller trained, had spent time with the Order of Serenity, and she had a unique streak of compassion that was both a blessing and a nuisance. Augusta understood her concerns, but the squad was under orders. ‘Sister,’ she said. ‘You have never encountered the Inquisition, but believe me, we will need to arrive promptly.’ Melia glanced at her, her expression a question. Augusta said, raising her voice a little so the others could hear, ‘Only once, and only briefly – Inquisitor Tuccius and his storm troopers came to the planet Lyca, investigating the High Deacon. They wield fear like a weapon, authority like a banner – they answer to the Emperor alone. I know nothing of Istrix herself, but she is the holy servant of the Emperor, His will made manifest, and our service to her is an honour.’ Melia said, ‘Aye, Sister,’ and sat back, murmuring a prayer. The vox-grille crackled again. ‘Approaching the debris field now. Be warned, Sisters, this could get rough.’ The engines fired and slowed. Augusta touched a hand to the front of her armour, breathing the words of the litany. ‘By the Light!’ The awed whisper was Akemi. They all turned. Below them, the planet Lycheate lay waiting, the haze-blur of its atmosphere a dirty, reddish-brown. To their left, its star was sullen, red and swollen with vast age. But it was not the star, nor its satellite, that had caught the squad’s attention. Outside the shuttle, the first of the moon-pieces was now coming past them, a slow and silent tumble of shattered rock. It was oddly serene; a turning of glitter and angle, of dark, crystalline colours all frosted with cold. And soon, there were hundreds of them. Thousands. The Sisters sat staring, their breaths taken away. As they passed, many of the fragments offered hints of their previous life – of the frozen edges of mine workings, of scaffold and steel, of vox-antennae and torn-open habitat. There was industry wreckage, like the shattered splinters of the great machine-spirit, all snapped and broken, its pieces still reaching out to the vacuum. Augusta could almost imagine the moons’ endings, that silent boom of slow motion detonations, one after another, the spiralling of the pieces forming the ring that now orbited this lost Mechanicus world. It was a reminder of the Emperor’s power, of His grace and strength, of His great might that spanned the vastness of space. The shuttle slowed. Its engines fired as it curved carefully from side to side. Still watching, Augusta offered her voice in a Requiem. Around her, the others lent their song to hers – Melia’s velvet contralto, Akemi’s pure, clear harmony. ‘Dies Irae, Dies Illa! Solvet saeclum in favilla!’ The Day of Wrath! That day will dissolve the world in ashes! The Sister Superior shivered. Under her vambraces, the hair on her forearms was standing on end. The grille crackled again, shattering the moment. ‘Pleazzz… assist… oxy… deplet… hours…’ ‘In the Emperor’s name,’ Melia said softly. ‘There can’t still be workers out there!’ ‘Ignore it, Sister.’ The voice was the pilot, her tone still firm. Melia sat upright, her expression hardening. ‘Pilot–’ ‘Sister,’ Augusta said. A larger piece of moon loomed close to the window, a gleam of tram-lines clearly visible. ‘Let the pilot focus. We must attain the surface safely, and without delay.’ The words were a warning, and Melia fell silent. But the vox-grille still crackled, the voice now tightening with panic. It was offering coordinates, the numbers broken by the spit and fizzle of the star’s radiation, and by the spin of the passing rock. ‘That’s close,’ Caia said, checking her auspex. ‘Those coordinates are–’ ‘It’s not a distress call.’ The pilot’s interruption was curt. Melia stared at the vox-grille. ‘What?’ Augusta was studying the silent dance outside, watching the edges of the rocks as they slowly sailed past. The one at the window had gone, revealing a longer view – and a silhouette of familiar shapes. A line of titanic gun-muzzles, now covering the debris field. They turned, tracking the Aquila as it passed. ‘Hold on!’ The voice was the pilot’s, suddenly sharp. The old shuttle banked hard, into a turn; Augusta’s belly lurched. The engines whined and strained; their noise burrowed in her ears like a bloodworm. Outside the window, the moon-pieces pitched abruptly sideways and were gone. Gripping the arms of the chair, she leaned back, exhaling more of the hymn. ‘Imperator majistatis, Qui salvandos salvas gratis, Salva nos, fons pietatis!’ Emperor of majesty, Who saves those who are to be saved, Save us, O fount of mercy! ‘Keep holding!’ The pilot spoke again, her tone tight. With a rush, the vehicle banked further, turning right over; the fragments outside were suddenly way too close for comfort. The Sister Superior tightened her grip, still praying. She had no fear of dying in battle – weapons in hands and praising Him – but this, this sudden threat of a cold and unmarked doom… This was not something she could control, and she disliked it intensely. The vox-grille spoke again. ‘The signal is an automation, Sisters, calculated to lure unwary transports. If the defences don’t kill us, then the collision probably will. And the pieces can be picked up by the pirates.’ The pilot’s voice spat and sputtered with electricity and tension. ‘With the Emperor’s blessing, we should clear the debris field in about four– And again.’ The Aquila banked the other way, throwing Augusta sideways in the seat. She could feel the shuttle’s engines as the vehicle twisted and shuddered, hear them straining, higher and lighter than those of the frigate. They hummed in protest as it turned past another huge fragment of rock. Drawing in her breath, she murmured further lines of the Requiem, the sound blending harmoniously with the engines’ song. ‘Confutatis maledictis, Fammis acribus addictis Voca me com benedictis!’ Once the accursed have been silenced, Sentenced to acrid flames, Call me thus with the blessed! ‘Four minutes,’ Viola said, her tone biting. ‘I thought Captain Mulier said the emplacements were abandoned?’ ‘Not all of them,’ Akemi answered her. ‘When the Mechanicus withdrew from Lycheate, they must have armed the debris ring to keep the planet secure. It seems their emplacements have been repurposed.’ ‘But there’s no gravity, no reactors, no nothing,’ Caia said, looking out at the pieces. ‘How can anything live out here?’ ‘They’re probably controlled from the surface,’ Akemi said. ‘They…’ She stopped as one of the visible emplacements suddenly blossomed with globular flame. A red streak came hard across the darkness; the whole vessel shook as it banked for a fourth turn. The Sisters could almost feel the missile as it streaked beneath the agile lander’s belly, then detonated on the rock beyond. More fragments tumbled, tiny pieces newly broken. ‘That one wasn’t automated,’ Caia said. ‘That targeted the engines.’ She raised her voice to speak into the grille, ‘Can we return fire, pilot?’ ‘I’d rather not, Sister,’ the pilot said, her tone sharp. ‘We’re not armed for a fight. Better we just get out of here, and into the atmosphere proper. Once we’re through the debris-ring, this should get easier.’ ‘Let them concentrate, Sister,’ Augusta said, again. Her tone was sharper than she’d meant it, and she made an effort to speak with proper control. ‘This is not our task. We will place our trust in the God-Emperor, in the spirit of this landing craft, and in its pilot, who does His work.’ She ended the Requiem and began to murmur the more familiar words of the litany, and felt the others join her. Felt them steady. From the lightning and the tempest… As if it had heard them, the vehicle returned again to a level flight path, and Augusta felt her belly-tension ease. Beside her, Melia blew out her breath; the others sat back, began to relax. The last of the pieces of rock sailed slowly past the windows, and were gone. Beneath them now, the planet gleamed like rust. Engines firing, the Aquila picked up speed. Soon, they felt the bounce and judder as the shuttle penetrated the outer atmosphere. And slowly, a glittering arc of light to the eyes of the planet below, it began its descent. ‘Sister. Superior. Augusta. Santorus.’ Inquisitor Istrix pronounced each word like a passing of her judgement, chill and merciless. ‘Your closeness to my location must be the Will of the Emperor Himself.’ Her faintly acerbic tone echoed in the empty metal shelving that surrounded them, in the corrosion of centuries that stretched upwards to an unseen ceiling. With its loading bay doors now closed, the old Munitorum depot was large enough to have accommodated the ­Aquila’s landing, small enough to be secure, and secure enough to be guarded by whatever force Istrix had brought with her. Privately, Augusta complimented the inquisitor on her choice of briefing location – there was little that could reach them in here. Aloud, however, the Sister Superior said nothing. She and her squad stood at parade ground attention: feet together, hands at their sides, their gazes clear and straight ahead. In her black armour and grey robes, Istrix barely came up to Augusta’s nose, yet the mantle of her authority was tangible. She eyed them critically, one after another. Her odd, pale green gaze took in the scars on their armour left by the Lautis daemons, the purity seals, the merit-beads, the elaborate filigree work on Viola’s thrice-blessed heavy bolter. She looked like she was ticking them off a list. ‘The Order of the Bloody Rose,’ she continued, her words still heavily weighted. ‘Followers of Saint Mina. One of the younger militant Orders, and founded by Deacis IV. Your Order have quite the martial reputation, Sister Superior, ferocious with both faith and blade. Is this true?’ ‘Emperor willing, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, still staring straight ahead. Istrix nodded. ‘Good. Your courage becomes you.’ At the inquisitor’s shoulder, there stood a tall young man, his gear Militarum issue, all green and beige, his skin rich and dark. His brassard bore two stripes, but scars and dirt had obscured his regimental insignia. From the state of his kit, he looked like he’d been here for some time. ‘I know your canoness,’ Istrix said. She made no attempt to explain the comment, but went on, ‘Captain Mulier will convey to her my orders. Down here, securing off-planet communication can be… challenging.’ She gave a small, cold smile. ‘It is possible, but it requires either force, or coin. And until recently, my presence has been… necessarily discreet.’ The corporal kept his eyes on his boots. ‘Very well, Sisters,’ Istrix said. ‘At ease.

But once we leave this location, my resources are few. Lycheate is a lawless world, Sisters – a world of pirate and trader and ganger, of human and xenos, of cultist and witch and psyker. There is no Ecclesiarchy here, no governor. No neat chimes to mark the hours.’ Her face was sharp, narrow as a hatchet. ‘Here, the order is one of power, of wit and money, of force and reputation.

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR In all the years of her service to the Emperor, Augusta had never seen a planet quite like Lycheate. This was not a place for her martial expertise, nor a place for skirmish tactics or strategic advances. This was a vast and creaking sprawl of corrosion and splotched rust, its polluted waters hissing as they tugged at the crumbling uprights. Looking down, she didn’t need an auspex to tell her if she fell from the platform, she’d be kneeling before the Golden Throne. The inquisitor, however, paid the filthy water no attention. She showed no fear – the only emotion that crossed her small, tight face was disdain. She’d given her troops a curt set of orders, and had requisitioned Sister Caia to be her personal lookout and bodyguard. And then, she’d walked out as if she owned the entire planet. Augusta had followed, watching the woman’s upright, grey-robed back. The Sister Superior’s thoughts were oddly uneasy – though she could not identify why. Perhaps it was just the air of the planet itself. Out in the open, Lycheate’s atmosphere was thick, brown and cold. As they moved away from the base and out onto the layers of walkways, the wind made the scaffolding creak and sing. Metallic dust clogged her visor, and she kept wiping it away. Istrix at their head, they walked silent and double file. The platforms groaned and scraped beneath their feet. Over the vox, Akemi warned them not to march in rhythm, as they would increase the stress on the already rotting metal, and tumble helpless into the waters below. At times, half-decomposed bodies floated under them like warnings. Augusta walked warily, bolter in hand. In her scarlet armour, she felt conspicuous, exposed to threats from every angle. A thousand ambush points surrounded them – layers of steps and catwalks, of pipes and gantries, of lifts and tracks and carts and rusting cargo-haulers. And, if she looked all the way up, she could see the narrow strip of the brown and twilight sky, and the sparkle of the debris field in the light of the dying sun. The whole place stank of rot, as if He had turned His face from the last of its corroding, fading life. A spiritu dominatus… Softly and over the vox, she sang the words of the litany. The others joined her, their close harmonies rising like the wind in the pipework. He was here, as He always would be. Behind the Sisters, their big boots loud, walked Corporal Mors and the surviving three members of his squad – Rufus the medicae, a scar through his brown eyebrow, Lucio, small and blond and bright-eyed, and a rangy, dark woman, Adriene. They were all equally grubby and startlingly young, but they walked alert, weapons in hands. The inquisitor, however, did not bother to look back – she marched at their forefront with no flicker of doubt or compromise, marched like the demand of the Emperor Himself. At the briefing, she had offered them only a minimal set of orders; she had not as much as detailed an outline of her mission. They were here to locate the witch, and they were not to open fire without her direct command. That was all. The lack of information was both unusual and unsettling, but Istrix was the will of the Emperor, and she worked in His name – it was not Augusta’s place to question her. Domine, libra nos. The words of the litany flowed like faith, pure across the umber air. ‘Be wary,’ Augusta told her Sisters, over the vox. ‘We track a psyker. Trickery may abound. Keep vigilant, and guard your souls and your minds.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ The words of the others were steady, their litany strong. Their voices continued to sing, soft and intricate. As they moved further, however, the Sisters began to hear different noises. Clanking. Shouting. Gunfire. Detonations. Running feet. The unmistakeable sounds of heavy, desperate splashing. Caia said, ‘To our left, next platform over. They’re not bothered with us. They’re moving away.’ The surrounding violence was rapidly becoming common-place. From the lightning and the tempest… Amid the song of the litany, Augusta commented, ‘We are very visible – we will be a target, and soon.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Aye,’ Caia returned. ‘Scan continues.’ They went onwards, the sounds around them becoming more frequent. They had seen no one close, not yet, but it was surely only a matter of time before the denizens of this place made themselves known. Renegades, cultists and witches; the lost and the godless. Augusta’s hand tightened on her weapon, her skin prickled with tension. Somewhere in her memory, she heard Subul’s laughter, the boom and rumble of the Lautis daemon… From plague, temptation and war… ‘Sisters,’ Caia said. ‘We’ve got company.’ ‘Location?’ Augusta said. ‘To the left. Half a dozen contacts running parallel. Whatever’s here, we’ve got its attention.’ ‘I hear you. Eyes open.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘You will remain on your guard, Sisters.’ Cutting across the vox’s open channel, Istrix’s tones were severe. ‘But I repeat – you will open fire only if I give you a direct order. Is that understood?’ Augusta said, ‘Yes, inquisitor.’ ‘For now, we will veer right, and remain out of range.’ Pulled by the inquisitor’s relentless forward march, they continued. Slowly, the platforms spread wider, became flat, open spaces that stretched between vat and tank and workshop, all of them engraved with the cog-and-skull of the absent Mechanicus. The brown sky slowly darkened, and the age-old lumens coughed into life. The centuries-old numerical denominations became cast in shadows; they, too, were caked in dust. The contacts continued to run parallel. ‘We’ve got more,’ Caia said. ‘Now both sides. They’re starting to close.’ From the scourge of the Kraken… ‘They’re herding us,’ Augusta commented. ‘We must halt, and take a defensible position–’ ‘Throne!’ Caia’s curse was vehement. ‘We’ve walked right into the middle of them!’ Our Emperor, deliver us! Augusta’s heart thumped with sudden adrenaline. She blinked in her retinal lenses, scanned with her preysight for the blurs of warmth. Her mind was working – she needed to assess, to give commands, to formulate both offence and defence… Somewhere ahead of her, a voice said, ‘Nice to see you, ladies.’ Istrix held up a hand. ‘Halt.’ Immediately, Augusta said, ‘Defence pattern beta. Mors, pull your troops back behind our cover.’ All four Sisters deployed to a compass defence, watching every direction. The Militarum soldiers pulled back into their centre, their lasrifles defended by the Sisters’ ­heavier armour. Scanning for enemies, Augusta said, ‘Caia?’ Caia said, ‘Ahead and to both sides, close range. Multiple targets. Estimate more than forty individuals, though it’s hard to tell their armament.’ ‘Mechanicus?’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia said. ‘Mostly human. They’re confident, though. And they definitely knew we were coming.’ Istrix, however, didn’t care. ‘Show yourself.’ A snort answered her. Angled from somewhere below the platform, a single red light appeared on her chest. She looked at it as one might look at an insect. Bolter in hand, awaiting the order to fire, Augusta scanned further, assembling information. The platform they stood upon was open, and almost alone – the planet’s waters stretched around it, black and deadly and filled with garbage. Ahead of them, the area narrowed to a single walkway, a narrow steel alley caught between a rust-splotched tank at one side and a tall wall of storage crates on the other. At their top perched a huge servo-hauler crane. It was too obvious an ambush point – and if that crane came down, it would smash the entire platform into the filth below… From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The Sister Superior drew in her breath, still singing the litany, the words as strong as the bolter in her hand. She held herself firmly in check, looking for the escape routes, the clear lines of fire, the tell-tale glimmers of warmth that were there, there and there. She could feel the eagerness that came from them; feel the seething corruption of this whole place. It crawled in her skin like an infection. Our Emperor, deliver us. Her anger, her need to fire, was strong. Her purpose was pure, clear, unquestioned; the thump of the blood in her veins was steady, insistent. She needed to draw her blade, to bring His wrath down upon every suffering, sneering occupant of this machine-dead pit… But she could not. Despite her need to loose both hymnal and bolter, however, she stayed in control. Twenty years’ experience had given the Sister Superior a solid core of practicality that enabled her to hold her position, and wait. She said, softly and over the vox, ‘Corporal, when the order is given to open fire, your squad will take the upper levels. Your primary targets will be atop the tank, and anything upon the crane. Everything close belongs to us.’ Mors said, ‘Yes, Sister.’ The voice came again, mocking. ‘Quite the army you’ve got there. Little thing like you.’ ‘I said, show yourself.’ Istrix’s tone was ice. ‘Listen to you.’ The voice sniggered. ‘Thinking you can walk round here like you own the place.’ Istrix snorted, the sound utterly scathing. ‘What’s she doing?’ Viola said, over their private channel. ‘Can’t she just give him orders or some–?’ ‘Silence,’ Augusta told her shortly. Viola subsided, but the muzzle of the heavy bolter twitched as it covered the walkway ahead. Augusta heard the corporal growl softly, ‘Hold steady, eyes open. Keep pressure on the – shit!’ Ahead of them, something big and metallic had rumbled into motion. The walkway creaked under its weight. ‘Kataphron,’ Caia said shortly, her tone a curse. ‘Breacher, I think. It’s blocking the exit. Heavy rifle in its left arm. Looks like it’s been scratch-repaired.’ ‘Keep vigilant, Sisters,’ Augusta said. ‘There may be more.’ The Sister Superior’s line of sight was blocked by Istrix’s armoured figure, but she could still make out the thing’s brutal, half-metal skull, its blank and open eyes, one of them gleaming red with an augmetic targeter. She heard the metal grumble of tracks as the thing rolled forwards. ‘So, why don’t we give you a proper Lycheate welcome, ladies?’ The owner of the voice was somewhere below them, and Augusta couldn’t see him. ‘Weapons on the floor, hands in the sky. Unless you want my friend here to get tetchy.’ Istrix gave a short, impatient sigh. ‘Sister Superior, rid us of this obstacle.’ And then everything happened at once. They had little cover, and less time. As Istrix gave her order, the inquisitor vaulted clean over the railing and dropped from Augusta’s line of sight, her movements surprisingly lithe. Caia followed her. Dropping to a kneel, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Take it down!’ From the begetting of daemons! She heard the litany hit a crescendo, heard a heavy bolter as it thundered into a full, directed burst. In the open channel of the vox, there was a faint, awed whistle from one of the Militarum soldiers. ‘Shut it.’ The corporal growled the warning. ‘Corp.’ The voice sounded like Lucio, the youngest of the four. Viola, her hymn fully as furious as the bolter itself, loosed her full rage at the tracked servitor. But the thing was just too big. It was slow, clunky, poorly repaired – yet its chest armour was heavy, all clumsily re-welded pieces of flexsteel. Rounds struck and spanged, leaving dents. Snarling, Viola aimed at its head, but a heavy, spot-welded helmet defeated the directed burst. The thing’s torso rocked; detonations filled the air. Its shoulder grinding audibly, it raised the rifle. And the servitor was not alone. From behind Augusta came the cough and roar of Melia’s flamer. Sheltered from the Breacher by the curve of the tank, the rest of the gang were jumping down to the platform, a scruffy assortment of pirates and roughnecks, their armour scavenged, their weapons poor. Our Emperor, deliver us! The flamer spat death. Attackers ignited, weapons exploding as magazines overheated. Melia, too, called the words of the litany, her anger seeming almost a blessing as she freed the nonbelievers from their cursed existence. ‘By the Emperor,’ Lucio was still muttering, his tones awed. ‘I’ve never seen fighting like it!’ Mors snapped, ‘I said, shut it.’ Knowing they couldn’t see, Augusta let herself grin, tight and lethal. ‘Go down, you cursed machine!’ Viola swore; the Breacher guttered and rocked, but the grinding continued. Any moment, it would hose the platform with rounds. ‘Back!’ The Sister Superior barked orders. ‘Use the tank as cover! Viola, take out the tracks!’ Shoving the soldiers behind her, she and the other two Sisters retreated back across the main platform. High-speed explosions chewed lines of holes in the metal of tank and walkway both, making them creak and screech. Viola followed the Sisters’ retreat, her bolter still battering the thing as it tried to roll forwards. From the curse of the mutant! With a sudden, livid cry that was more snarl than hymn, she aimed her full rate of fire at the joint where the walkway met the platform. A volley of rounds hit and detonated. The walkway juddered and cracked. As the monster servitor rolled onwards, its tracks found the weak point. There was a scrape and a jolt, and the whole thing pitched nose-down, the heavy rifle now aimed at the waters below. This time, even the corporal loosed a curse. But, even as metal creaking grew more urgent, the heavy bolter thumped and clattered as it ran out of ammunition. ‘Above you!’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Heads up!’ A head and forearm were poking from the top of the tank, a long barrel just coming into view. The corporal hit the sniper cleanly, his single shot sizzling across the half-light. Augusta watched the figure’s head explode, the body teeter and plummet. Melia’s flamer whooshed again – a great spitting curve as she brought the weapon round in an arc. Screams followed, bodies tumbled, splashing as they hit the water. In an instant, fire roared across the water’s oily surface, lighting the entire platform to a ruddy-hued hellscape. The metal creaked again. Still at Augusta’s shoulder, the corporal barked, ‘There’s more of them! On top of the crane!’ Lasguns sizzled at another layer of snipers. The air cracked with lines of heat. The attackers swore and fell back, holes seared in their vulnerable flesh. Another one tumbled loose, and hit the catwalk with a crash. The metal shook again. ‘It’s going to collapse!’ Akemi said. Her bolter barked as she kept firing. ‘Motion slowing.’ Caia’s voice came through the vox. ‘I’ve got fleeing contacts on all sides.’ Augusta heard the grin, heard the sharp crack of her weapon as she made sure. ‘Mercenaries!’ The word was a snort. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said. ‘What’s your location?’ ‘Look down,’ Caia replied. ‘I’m still with the inquisitor. And she’s requesting… demanding… your presence.’ Leaving the other three Sisters and the four Militarum soldiers under Melia’s command, Augusta saw immediately where Istrix had gone – the inquisitor had followed the angle of the earlier targeter, and had jumped from the walkway. She’d landed on a small lift platform, some four feet below. Sister Caia was still with her – and she had shoved her bolter, hard, under the chin of a small and grubby figure. Over the Sisters’ vox, she said, ‘Look, we’ve caught ourselves a rat.’ As Augusta jumped down, the man’s dirty, lined face paled even further. ‘Hey, I’m just trying to make a living!’ ‘You’re a thief and a bully,’ Caia said curtly. ‘And your “living” is over.’ ‘Please, Sister, I was only–’ he stopped as the bolter pressed harder. The inquisitor said, her tone like steel, ‘You have made a very unwise mistake.’ ‘Please!’ The man was almost gibbering. ‘We just collect the tithes, that’s all. Y’know, try to survive, make a little profit–’ ‘Tithes?’ Istrix grabbed his shirt and shook him like a captured gretchin. ‘Are you some local baron, to make such demands?’ ‘I’m no one, not really.’ He was stammering, scared. ‘I just work here. But I do know things. I can help you.’ He gave a sickly, ingratiating grin. ‘If you’re heading to the city, I can get you in. I know the routes. The people. I can tell you who you need to find.’ Augusta still flanking her like a bodyguard, Istrix stepped back and pulled a long votive chain from the neck of her grey robe. On its end, it bore the symbol of the Inquisition, glittering in the light from flame and lumens both. The man swallowed, going green. ‘You know who I am?’ Her cold tones were layered with both authority and scorn. ‘The…’ The man’s face changed. Glancing down, the Sister Superior could see the dark patch now flooding the front of his trousers. He gibbered, ‘I can tell you anything, everything you need to know. Please…’ ‘Maybe you can.’ Istrix gave a small, amused smile. ‘You listen to me, little man, and you listen well. I am the word of the Emperor and I am His law. I have the Sisters of Battle at my back, carrying His faith and His torch. And there is no force on this miserable planet, nothing Zale can array against me, nothing he can muster, that is enough to stop me, or to get in my way. Do you understand? Now – tell me where he’s gone.’ ‘Where who’s gone? I don’t know who you mean!’ The man was almost sobbing with fear. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know…’ ‘Whether he’s lying or not,’ Caia commented, over the vox, ‘he’ll betray us the moment we’ve gone.’ ‘Of course he will.’ Augusta stepped forwards, and bent the man back over the lift’s metal railing. The water sloshed and hissed. The last of the flames had flickered to nothing and the garbage on its surface was ash. ‘Enough,’ Istrix said. ‘He lives. On one condition.’ ‘Anything.’ The man was snivelling, snot running down his face. ‘Anything. Just – please – don’t build me into a machine!’ ‘I would not bestow such a blessing upon you,’ she said, scathing. ‘Besides, I doubt you would have the stamina for it. I need you to do something for me.’ He sniffled. ‘Whatever you want. Whoever you want.’ Istrix said, ‘Do you know a woman called Rayos?’ Augusta and Caia exchanged a glance, but said nothing. The inquisitor continued. ‘She’s a local, a seeker of knowledge, and she’s very… distinctive.’ Her tone seemed oddly amused. ‘She’s one of my few known contacts on this cesspit of a world. Do you know who she is?’ Sniffling, the man nodded. ‘You will take her a message.’ He said, ‘Rayos doesn’t–’ ‘You were given an order, worm,’ Caia said, her bolter pressing harder. Istrix shot the Sister a sharp look for speaking out of line; let the look continue to Augusta, a raised eyebrow at her discipline of her troops. ‘All right, all right!’ The man was sobbing now. ‘I’ll do anything!’ On the platform above them, pairs of armoured legs were moving in methodical patterns as the squad despatched the last of their opponents, and threw the bodies over the side. The black boots of the corporal had appeared beside the heavy metal tracks of the doomed Breacher, and a single ­sizzle of light finally shut the thing down. ‘If you lie to me…’ Istrix leaned in close, and spoke softly, ‘I won’t only kill you, little man. I will tear your soul into screaming pieces. And I’ll do it slowly.’ The man had sunk to the floor. He was curling in on himself, almost numb with terror. Istrix planted her boot against his shoulder and made him look up. ‘Well?’ Slowly, still sniffing, he began to nod. ‘I know the woman you mean. She’s been here a long time. Gets a lot of work. Knows a lot of people. I’ll take her your message.’ ‘I thought so.’ The inquisitor was smiling, her scars creasing with the expression. ‘Tell her… tell her I’m here. Tell her to be in the Archeotech, this evening. Tell her… I have a deal to make. And that I can make it worth her while.’ The man was still nodding, relief flooding the movement. ‘I promise, I promise. In the Emperor’s name.’ ‘Very well,’ Istrix said, moving her foot. ‘You can go.’ ‘With all due respect, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, ‘this creature surely cannot be trusted…’ ‘I gave you an order, Sister Superior.’ Istrix’s tone was cold. ‘Release him. He may betray us, but that also works to my advantage.’ She turned, her pale green eyes alight with an odd intensity. ‘I want Zale to know I’m coming. I want him to know that I have the Sisters of Battle at my back. And I want him afraid.’ Her tone was firm. Over the vox, Caia said, ‘Sister Superior–’ ‘Do not voice the thought, Sister,’ Augusta warned her. ‘To question the inquisitor is heresy.’ Both Sisters stepped back. Fast as a rat, the man was over the railing and gone. Istrix lifted her chin, her expression stony. Her fine latticework of scars glowed like inlaid wires. She said, ‘We are the chosen of the Emperor, Sisters, His children, and we fear nothing. What is there ahead of us that can defeat the will of the Inquisition, and the faith of the Sisters of Battle? This city holds no fears for such as we.’ Augusta saluted, said, ‘Mea fides est, et ferrum armis.’ My faith is my shield and my blade. ‘Sister…’ Again, Caia’s voice over the Sisters’ private channel. ‘Be silent.’ Augusta answered the unspoken doubt with no compromise in her tone. ‘She is the voice of the God-Emperor, and we will not discuss this again.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR In all the years of her service to the Emperor, Augusta had never seen a planet quite like Lycheate. This was not a place for her martial expertise, nor a place for skirmish tactics or strategic advances. This was a vast and creaking sprawl of corrosion and splotched rust, its polluted waters hissing as they tugged at the crumbling uprights. Looking down, she didn’t need an auspex to tell her if she fell from the platform, she’d be kneeling before the Golden Throne. The inquisitor, however, paid the filthy water no attention. She showed no fear – the only emotion that crossed her small, tight face was disdain. She’d given her troops a curt set of orders, and had requisitioned Sister Caia to be her personal lookout and bodyguard. And then, she’d walked out as if she owned the entire planet. Augusta had followed, watching the woman’s upright, grey-robed back. The Sister Superior’s thoughts were oddly uneasy – though she could not identify why. Perhaps it was just the air of the planet itself. Out in the open, Lycheate’s atmosphere was thick, brown and cold. As they moved away from the base and out onto the layers of walkways, the wind made the scaffolding creak and sing. Metallic dust clogged her visor, and she kept wiping it away. Istrix at their head, they walked silent and double file. The platforms groaned and scraped beneath their feet. Over the vox, Akemi warned them not to march in rhythm, as they would increase the stress on the already rotting metal, and tumble helpless into the waters below. At times, half-decomposed bodies floated under them like warnings. Augusta walked warily, bolter in hand. In her scarlet armour, she felt conspicuous, exposed to threats from every angle. A thousand ambush points surrounded them – layers of steps and catwalks, of pipes and gantries, of lifts and tracks and carts and rusting cargo-haulers. And, if she looked all the way up, she could see the narrow strip of the brown and twilight sky, and the sparkle of the debris field in the light of the dying sun. The whole place stank of rot, as if He had turned His face from the last of its corroding, fading life. A spiritu dominatus… Softly and over the vox, she sang the words of the litany. The others joined her, their close harmonies rising like the wind in the pipework. He was here, as He always would be. Behind the Sisters, their big boots loud, walked Corporal Mors and the surviving three members of his squad – Rufus the medicae, a scar through his brown eyebrow, Lucio, small and blond and bright-eyed, and a rangy, dark woman, Adriene. They were all equally grubby and startlingly young, but they walked alert, weapons in hands. The inquisitor, however, did not bother to look back – she marched at their forefront with no flicker of doubt or compromise, marched like the demand of the Emperor Himself. At the briefing, she had offered them only a minimal set of orders; she had not as much as detailed an outline of her mission. They were here to locate the witch, and they were not to open fire without her direct command. That was all. The lack of information was both unusual and unsettling, but Istrix was the will of the Emperor, and she worked in His name – it was not Augusta’s place to question her. Domine, libra nos. The words of the litany flowed like faith, pure across the umber air. ‘Be wary,’ Augusta told her Sisters, over the vox. ‘We track a psyker. Trickery may abound. Keep vigilant, and guard your souls and your minds.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ The words of the others were steady, their litany strong. Their voices continued to sing, soft and intricate. As they moved further, however, the Sisters began to hear different noises. Clanking. Shouting. Gunfire. Detonations. Running feet. The unmistakeable sounds of heavy, desperate splashing. Caia said, ‘To our left, next platform over. They’re not bothered with us. They’re moving away.’ The surrounding violence was rapidly becoming common-place. From the lightning and the tempest… Amid the song of the litany, Augusta commented, ‘We are very visible – we will be a target, and soon.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘Aye,’ Caia returned. ‘Scan continues.’ They went onwards, the sounds around them becoming more frequent. They had seen no one close, not yet, but it was surely only a matter of time before the denizens of this place made themselves known. Renegades, cultists and witches; the lost and the godless. Augusta’s hand tightened on her weapon, her skin prickled with tension. Somewhere in her memory, she heard Subul’s laughter, the boom and rumble of the Lautis daemon… From plague, temptation and war… ‘Sisters,’ Caia said. ‘We’ve got company.’ ‘Location?’ Augusta said. ‘To the left. Half a dozen contacts running parallel. Whatever’s here, we’ve got its attention.’ ‘I hear you. Eyes open.’ ‘Aye.’ Our Emperor, deliver us. ‘You will remain on your guard, Sisters.’ Cutting across the vox’s open channel, Istrix’s tones were severe. ‘But I repeat – you will open fire only if I give you a direct order. Is that understood?’ Augusta said, ‘Yes, inquisitor.’ ‘For now, we will veer right, and remain out of range.’ Pulled by the inquisitor’s relentless forward march, they continued. Slowly, the platforms spread wider, became flat, open spaces that stretched between vat and tank and workshop, all of them engraved with the cog-and-skull of the absent Mechanicus. The brown sky slowly darkened, and the age-old lumens coughed into life. The centuries-old numerical denominations became cast in shadows; they, too, were caked in dust. The contacts continued to run parallel. ‘We’ve got more,’ Caia said. ‘Now both sides. They’re starting to close.’ From the scourge of the Kraken… ‘They’re herding us,’ Augusta commented. ‘We must halt, and take a defensible position–’ ‘Throne!’ Caia’s curse was vehement. ‘We’ve walked right into the middle of them!’ Our Emperor, deliver us! Augusta’s heart thumped with sudden adrenaline. She blinked in her retinal lenses, scanned with her preysight for the blurs of warmth. Her mind was working – she needed to assess, to give commands, to formulate both offence and defence… Somewhere ahead of her, a voice said, ‘Nice to see you, ladies.’ Istrix held up a hand. ‘Halt.’ Immediately, Augusta said, ‘Defence pattern beta. Mors, pull your troops back behind our cover.’ All four Sisters deployed to a compass defence, watching every direction. The Militarum soldiers pulled back into their centre, their lasrifles defended by the Sisters’ ­heavier armour. Scanning for enemies, Augusta said, ‘Caia?’ Caia said, ‘Ahead and to both sides, close range. Multiple targets. Estimate more than forty individuals, though it’s hard to tell their armament.’ ‘Mechanicus?’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia said. ‘Mostly human. They’re confident, though. And they definitely knew we were coming.’ Istrix, however, didn’t care. ‘Show yourself.’ A snort answered her. Angled from somewhere below the platform, a single red light appeared on her chest. She looked at it as one might look at an insect. Bolter in hand, awaiting the order to fire, Augusta scanned further, assembling information. The platform they stood upon was open, and almost alone – the planet’s waters stretched around it, black and deadly and filled with garbage. Ahead of them, the area narrowed to a single walkway, a narrow steel alley caught between a rust-splotched tank at one side and a tall wall of storage crates on the other. At their top perched a huge servo-hauler crane. It was too obvious an ambush point – and if that crane came down, it would smash the entire platform into the filth below… From the blasphemy of the Fallen… The Sister Superior drew in her breath, still singing the litany, the words as strong as the bolter in her hand. She held herself firmly in check, looking for the escape routes, the clear lines of fire, the tell-tale glimmers of warmth that were there, there and there. She could feel the eagerness that came from them; feel the seething corruption of this whole place. It crawled in her skin like an infection. Our Emperor, deliver us. Her anger, her need to fire, was strong. Her purpose was pure, clear, unquestioned; the thump of the blood in her veins was steady, insistent. She needed to draw her blade, to bring His wrath down upon every suffering, sneering occupant of this machine-dead pit… But she could not. Despite her need to loose both hymnal and bolter, however, she stayed in control. Twenty years’ experience had given the Sister Superior a solid core of practicality that enabled her to hold her position, and wait. She said, softly and over the vox, ‘Corporal, when the order is given to open fire, your squad will take the upper levels. Your primary targets will be atop the tank, and anything upon the crane. Everything close belongs to us.’ Mors said, ‘Yes, Sister.’ The voice came again, mocking. ‘Quite the army you’ve got there. Little thing like you.’ ‘I said, show yourself.’ Istrix’s tone was ice. ‘Listen to you.’ The voice sniggered. ‘Thinking you can walk round here like you own the place.’ Istrix snorted, the sound utterly scathing. ‘What’s she doing?’ Viola said, over their private channel. ‘Can’t she just give him orders or some–?’ ‘Silence,’ Augusta told her shortly. Viola subsided, but the muzzle of the heavy bolter twitched as it covered the walkway ahead. Augusta heard the corporal growl softly, ‘Hold steady, eyes open. Keep pressure on the – shit!’ Ahead of them, something big and metallic had rumbled into motion. The walkway creaked under its weight. ‘Kataphron,’ Caia said shortly, her tone a curse. ‘Breacher, I think. It’s blocking the exit. Heavy rifle in its left arm. Looks like it’s been scratch-repaired.’ ‘Keep vigilant, Sisters,’ Augusta said. ‘There may be more.’ The Sister Superior’s line of sight was blocked by Istrix’s armoured figure, but she could still make out the thing’s brutal, half-metal skull, its blank and open eyes, one of them gleaming red with an augmetic targeter. She heard the metal grumble of tracks as the thing rolled forwards. ‘So, why don’t we give you a proper Lycheate welcome, ladies?’ The owner of the voice was somewhere below them, and Augusta couldn’t see him. ‘Weapons on the floor, hands in the sky.

They had little cover, and less time. As Istrix gave her order, the inquisitor vaulted clean over the railing and dropped from Augusta’s line of sight, her movements surprisingly lithe. Caia followed her. Dropping to a kneel, Augusta barked, ‘Viola! Take it down!’ From the begetting of daemons! She heard the litany hit a crescendo, heard a heavy bolter as it thundered into a full, directed burst. In the open channel of the vox, there was a faint, awed whistle from one of the Militarum soldiers. ‘Shut it.’ The corporal growled the warning. ‘Corp.’ The voice sounded like Lucio, the youngest of the four. Viola, her hymn fully as furious as the bolter itself, loosed her full rage at the tracked servitor. But the thing was just too big. It was slow, clunky, poorly repaired – yet its chest armour was heavy, all clumsily re-welded pieces of flexsteel. Rounds struck and spanged, leaving dents. Snarling, Viola aimed at its head, but a heavy, spot-welded helmet defeated the directed burst. The thing’s torso rocked; detonations filled the air. Its shoulder grinding audibly, it raised the rifle. And the servitor was not alone. From behind Augusta came the cough and roar of Melia’s flamer. Sheltered from the Breacher by the curve of the tank, the rest of the gang were jumping down to the platform, a scruffy assortment of pirates and roughnecks, their armour scavenged, their weapons poor. Our Emperor, deliver us! The flamer spat death. Attackers ignited, weapons exploding as magazines overheated. Melia, too, called the words of the litany, her anger seeming almost a blessing as she freed the nonbelievers from their cursed existence. ‘By the Emperor,’ Lucio was still muttering, his tones awed. ‘I’ve never seen fighting like it!’ Mors snapped, ‘I said, shut it.’ Knowing they couldn’t see, Augusta let herself grin, tight and lethal. ‘Go down, you cursed machine!’ Viola swore; the Breacher guttered and rocked, but the grinding continued. Any moment, it would hose the platform with rounds. ‘Back!’ The Sister Superior barked orders. ‘Use the tank as cover! Viola, take out the tracks!’ Shoving the soldiers behind her, she and the other two Sisters retreated back across the main platform. High-speed explosions chewed lines of holes in the metal of tank and walkway both, making them creak and screech. Viola followed the Sisters’ retreat, her bolter still battering the thing as it tried to roll forwards. From the curse of the mutant!

There was a scrape and a jolt, and the whole thing pitched nose-down, the heavy rifle now aimed at the waters below. This time, even the corporal loosed a curse. But, even as metal creaking grew more urgent, the heavy bolter thumped and clattered as it ran out of ammunition. ‘Above you!’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Heads up!’ A head and forearm were poking from the top of the tank, a long barrel just coming into view. The corporal hit the sniper cleanly, his single shot sizzling across the half-light. Augusta watched the figure’s head explode, the body teeter and plummet. Melia’s flamer whooshed again – a great spitting curve as she brought the weapon round in an arc. Screams followed, bodies tumbled, splashing as they hit the water. In an instant, fire roared across the water’s oily surface, lighting the entire platform to a ruddy-hued hellscape. The metal creaked again. Still at Augusta’s shoulder, the corporal barked, ‘There’s more of them! On top of the crane!’ Lasguns sizzled at another layer of snipers. The air cracked with lines of heat. The attackers swore and fell back, holes seared in their vulnerable flesh. Another one tumbled loose, and hit the catwalk with a crash. The metal shook again. ‘It’s going to collapse!’ Akemi said. Her bolter barked as she kept firing. ‘Motion slowing.’ Caia’s voice came through the vox. ‘I’ve got fleeing contacts on all sides.’ Augusta heard the grin, heard the sharp crack of her weapon as she made sure. ‘Mercenaries!’ The word was a snort. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said. ‘What’s your location?’ ‘Look down,’ Caia replied. ‘I’m still with the inquisitor.

Over the Sisters’ vox, she said, ‘Look, we’ve caught ourselves a rat.’ As Augusta jumped down, the man’s dirty, lined face paled even further. ‘Hey, I’m just trying to make a living!’ ‘You’re a thief and a bully,’ Caia said curtly. ‘And your “living” is over.’ ‘Please, Sister, I was only–’ he stopped as the bolter pressed harder. The inquisitor said, her tone like steel, ‘You have made a very unwise mistake.’ ‘Please!’ The man was almost gibbering. ‘We just collect the tithes, that’s all. Y’know, try to survive, make a little profit–’ ‘Tithes?’ Istrix grabbed his shirt and shook him like a captured gretchin. ‘Are you some local baron, to make such demands?’ ‘I’m no one, not really.’ He was stammering, scared. ‘I just work here. But I do know things. I can help you.’ He gave a sickly, ingratiating grin. ‘If you’re heading to the city, I can get you in. I know the routes. The people. I can tell you who you need to find.’ Augusta still flanking her like a bodyguard, Istrix stepped back and pulled a long votive chain from the neck of her grey robe. On its end, it bore the symbol of the Inquisition, glittering in the light from flame and lumens both. The man swallowed, going green. ‘You know who I am?’ Her cold tones were layered with both authority and scorn. ‘The…’ The man’s face changed. Glancing down, the Sister Superior could see the dark patch now flooding the front of his trousers. He gibbered, ‘I can tell you anything, everything you need to know. Please…’ ‘Maybe you can.’ Istrix gave a small, amused smile. ‘You listen to me, little man, and you listen well. I am the word of the Emperor and I am His law. I have the Sisters of Battle at my back, carrying His faith and His torch. And there is no force on this miserable planet, nothing Zale can array against me, nothing he can muster, that is enough to stop me, or to get in my way. Do you understand? Now – tell me where he’s gone.’ ‘Where who’s gone? I don’t know who you mean!’ The man was almost sobbing with fear. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know…’ ‘Whether he’s lying or not,’ Caia commented, over the vox, ‘he’ll betray us the moment we’ve gone.’ ‘Of course he will.’ Augusta stepped forwards, and bent the man back over the lift’s metal railing. The water sloshed and hissed. The last of the flames had flickered to nothing and the garbage on its surface was ash. ‘Enough,’ Istrix said. ‘He lives. On one condition.’ ‘Anything.’ The man was snivelling, snot running down his face. ‘Anything. Just – please – don’t build me into a machine!’ ‘I would not bestow such a blessing upon you,’ she said, scathing. ‘Besides, I doubt you would have the stamina for it. I need you to do something for me.’ He sniffled. ‘Whatever you want. Whoever you want.’ Istrix said, ‘Do you know a woman called Rayos?’ Augusta and Caia exchanged a glance, but said nothing. The inquisitor continued. ‘She’s a local, a seeker of knowledge, and she’s very… distinctive.’ Her tone seemed oddly amused. ‘She’s one of my few known contacts on this cesspit of a world. Do you know who she is?’ Sniffling, the man nodded. ‘You will take her a message.’ He said, ‘Rayos doesn’t–’ ‘You were given an order, worm,’ Caia said, her bolter pressing harder. Istrix shot the Sister a sharp look for speaking out of line; let the look continue to Augusta, a raised eyebrow at her discipline of her troops. ‘All right, all right!’ The man was sobbing now. ‘I’ll do anything!’ On the platform above them, pairs of armoured legs were moving in methodical patterns as the squad despatched the last of their opponents, and threw the bodies over the side. The black boots of the corporal had appeared beside the heavy metal tracks of the doomed Breacher, and a single ­sizzle of light finally shut the thing down. ‘If you lie to me…’ Istrix leaned in close, and spoke softly, ‘I won’t only kill you, little man. I will tear your soul into screaming pieces. And I’ll do it slowly.’ The man had sunk to the floor. He was curling in on himself, almost numb with terror. Istrix planted her boot against his shoulder and made him look up. ‘Well?’ Slowly, still sniffing, he began to nod. ‘I know the woman you mean. She’s been here a long time. Gets a lot of work. Knows a lot of people. I’ll take her your message.’ ‘I thought so.’ The inquisitor was smiling, her scars creasing with the expression. ‘Tell her… tell her I’m here. Tell her to be in the Archeotech, this evening. Tell her… I have a deal to make. And that I can make it worth her while.’ The man was still nodding, relief flooding the movement. ‘I promise, I promise. In the Emperor’s name.’ ‘Very well,’ Istrix said, moving her foot. ‘You can go.’ ‘With all due respect, inquisitor,’ Augusta said, ‘this creature surely cannot be trusted…’ ‘I gave you an order, Sister Superior.’ Istrix’s tone was cold. ‘Release him. He may betray us, but that also works to my advantage.’ She turned, her pale green eyes alight with an odd intensity. ‘I want Zale to know I’m coming. I want him to know that I have the Sisters of Battle at my back. And I want him afraid.’ Her tone was firm. Over the vox, Caia said, ‘Sister Superior–’ ‘Do not voice the thought, Sister,’ Augusta warned her. ‘To question the inquisitor is heresy.’ Both Sisters stepped back. Fast as a rat, the man was over the railing and gone. Istrix lifted her chin, her expression stony. Her fine latticework of scars glowed like inlaid wires. She said, ‘We are the chosen of the Emperor, Sisters, His children, and we fear nothing. What is there ahead of us that can defeat the will of the Inquisition, and the faith of the Sisters of Battle? This city holds no fears for such as we.’ Augusta saluted, said, ‘Mea fides est, et ferrum armis.’ My faith is my shield and my blade. ‘Sister…’ Again, Caia’s voice over the Sisters’ private channel. ‘Be silent.’ Augusta answered the unspoken doubt with no compromise in her tone. ‘She is the voice of the God-Emperor, and we will not discuss this again.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Lycheate city was designated ‘City-05’, and the crush and the stench were incredible. The place was a cacophony of noise – metallic music, harsh and jangling; voices, raised in shouts and anger. Everywhere, there was the push and shove of filthy, reeking humanity, with orks and beastmen in the seething crowd. There was the flit of the thief, the bulge of the mutant, the bellow of the roustabout thug. Sister Melia had seen such things before – she and Caia had both been with Augusta on Hadria, on their mission to recapture the renegade rogue trader Samual – but still, the stink and the corruption of this place crawled under her skin like an infection. She hated it; she needed to offer it the cleansing it so richly craved. She could feel the Sister Superior’s rising impatience, and her restraint; could feel the sharp sense of wariness that came from Akemi and Viola both, ­neither of them long from the schola. Yet Melia, her Hospitaller training rising in her heart, contorted with something else. These people had lost their way, lost the Light. They should be purged; they should be granted the Emperor’s final peace… She walked with her hand on her flamer, itching to pull it free. Around them, much of the machinery had been prayed to new life. It rattled and clanked. New devotions had been embossed into its surfaces; its old Mechanicus ­symbols had been cleaned and polished, or defaced and carved over. Liquid rumbled through endless pipes; bursts of steam hissed free from louvered vents, and rose, ghost-pale, into the almost-dark sky. The hauler engines were running here, clattering loudly in their tracks. Screen linked to screen and silent information flowed almost palpably across the air. In places, there were figures tending to them, praying. Melia caught flashes of additional limbs, of extended augmetics and hood-covered faces… Of the twists of warp and ruin that crept from the Mechanicus’ remaining skin. She shuddered. This whole place was a hive, a living, breathing melting-pot of machinery, and every type of depravity clamoured in its suspended steel streets. Before her, Sister Akemi walked slowly, a prayer on her lips. Melia was about to intercede when Augusta stopped beside the youngest Sister and gripped her shoulder in one gauntleted hand. ‘Have faith, Sister,’ she said. ‘He is with us, even here. Keep your thoughts on His light, and the despair of this place cannot touch you.’ Akemi nodded, continuing to pray. Melia echoed her, the words both strength and comfort. Yet her hand remained on her flamer. They walked on, their red boots clanging loudly. Desperate figures huddled away from them, crippled or mutated or both. Others turned as they passed, gaping in awe or astonishment. Still more narrowed their gazes, as if weighing the opportunity – then thought better of it and turned away. There were even those who tried to trade, bundles over their shoulders that they spread out, laden with scavenged treasures – machine parts, pict-slates, ancient fragments of forgotten weaponry. More than once, they saw a figure overwhelmed in a corner, and beaten casually to death. Nowhere were there soldiers, or any icons of either faith or authority. ‘By the Throne,’ Akemi said, her voice soft. ‘This place is a hell. It should be ended.’ ‘Why do they even come here?’ Viola asked. Istrix replied, her voice flat. ‘A place with no authority can be seen as an inviting prospect – somewhere that one can live without the restriction of rules. Outlaws and renegades, the lost, the unlucky, the mutant, the witch – all have rid themselves of the Emperor.’ Her voice curdled, sour with anger. ‘Here, they consider themselves free.’ ‘This is not freedom,’ Viola muttered, her tone edged with ferocity. She gestured with the bolter-muzzle, indicating their surroundings. ‘This is sacrilege.’ But Istrix turned sharply on her heel and faced them, making them stop. ‘I suggest you control yourself, Sister,’ she said, her voice flat. ‘I remind you again – you will take action only by my command.’ She held Viola’s gaze, stared her down. She turned to Augusta, making sure, then to Mors, one eyebrow raised. ‘Ave Imperator.’ The young man offered a salute, but he let his fist drop as soon as she’d turned away. The expressions of his squad, Melia noted, were less than properly schooled. They glanced at each other, silent stress shifting between them. Augusta was watching the inquisitor’s back. The Sister Superior’s expression was concealed by her helm, but her armoured shoulders seemed increasingly tense. It appeared, Melia thought, that there was more to Inquisitor Istrix than they’d realised. Staying close together, the group pushed onwards over the endless, groaning metal. It was fully dark, now, but the lumens were brighter and their light gleamed from the soldiers’ steaming breaths. The platforms were larger, better maintained, and many of the tanks and reactors had been repurposed as habitats or saloons. Smoke curled in the air – tabac sticks and kyxa weed. Coloured signs gleamed in darkened corners, ­making offers that made Lucio nudge his fellows and snicker. But Istrix did not care. She ignored the graffiti, scratched in mockery over the cogs and skulls of the original forge world; she ignored the sharp gazes of the curious opportunists, ignored the surrounding bodies, looted and rotting. She walked through all of it with her conviction blazing fearlessly, like an aura. The Sisters, in their scarlet armour, followed her, pushing through the grubby people like a wash of blood through rust. And the four soldiers walked with them, their eyes everywhere. At last, the inquisitor stopped. She indicated a large, cylindrical tank, standing alone at the platform’s outer edge – a smeltorium, perhaps, from the corroding pipes beneath. A sequence of binary code was carved into its outside. And below it, scratched into the metal, was the word, ‘Archeotech’. ‘Sssss.’ The noise might have been laughter, but it was mechanical, and oddly flat. In the dim illumination of the tank’s interior, a hooded figure sat in a defended seat, its back to the curve of the wall. Before it, the place was packed, all shouting and fighting and the pounding of scratch-built metal tables; the air stank of piss and spirits. The figure, however, did not raise its hood to look. On the other side of the table, Istrix stood solid, arms folded. The five Sisters flanked her like icons. Ranged with them, the Militarum soldiers seemed somewhat distracted. Lucio was looking around, and casting a wistful gaze at the battered metal mugs. Melia left him to it. Her attention was on the figure itself, and its mantled, augmetic limbs. A tech-priest. A renegade. Its cloak was black, shimmering with an oily glisten, and it bore a cog-symbol unfamiliar to the Sisters. Its limbs clicked and twitched; one claw pulled back its hood just enough to reveal a semi-human, female face, a single bright blue eye. Her other eye was an extending metal lens, glinting with a red, augmetic glare, and her mechadendrites rippled this way and that, scanning Istrix, the Sisters and the soldiers, and the bar in every direction. Satisfied with the data she had assembled, she sat back and hissed again, the noise like releasing steam. ‘Rayos.’ The inquisitor picked up a mug, eyed the contents, and clanked it back down on the table. ‘Inquisitor.’ The word was emotionless, emerging in ticks and whirs. ‘There has been an eighty-six point seven per cent chance that you would come, seeking my input.’ ‘Your information is excellent,’ Istrix said. It was statement, rather than question. ‘And I know about you, also – the heretek Vius was not alone in his desire to plunder the mysteries of Lycheate.’ The hood cocked to one side, the movement precise. ‘Vius is gone, his data held only in memory.’ The bar heaved and roared. From somewhere, there came singing, coarse and ragged like a shanty; the tables clattered in rhythm. Istrix said, ‘I wish to trade.’ Rayos let out another hiss. ‘My trade is forty-two point two per cent information, twenty-one point three per cent machine parts, and eleven point four per cent ores and minerals. The remainder can be defined as “unusual”, where that definition is taken from–’ ‘I’m looking for a man called Scafidis Zale,’ Istrix said, with a thin smile. ‘You either know where he is, or you can tell me where he may be found.’ The tech-priest sat back, her augmetic eye twisting as she focused upon Istrix’s face. ‘I can access this data,’ she said, at last. ‘But its release requires a very specific exchange.’ Istrix glanced pointedly at the Sisters that surrounded her, and leaned her knuckles on the table. The seemingly casual movement dropped her symbol from the front of her robes. It swayed there, glinting. ‘It’s not a request.’ The priest hissed again, the noise thoughtful. All of her mechadendrites had swivelled upwards to focus on the leaning figure. ‘You have…’ she paused, ‘…no authority here. And you do not have sufficient force of arms. Releasing this information may place my life at risk, and I will not offer you this data without a suitable reciprocal exchange.’ She turned away, as if the interview was closed. Melia found herself wondering if she’d try to throw them out. What binary messages were stealing out, even now, across the air? The Sister looked around for enforcers, but could see nothing obvious. ‘Inquisitor, with your permission?’ Augusta took a half-step forwards. Istrix nodded and stood upright, her arms folded. Augusta said, ‘Answer me, Rayos, yes or no – do you know the location of the witch?’ The priest turned back, raised her chin as if curious. ‘I can offer a ninety-seven point six per cent probability on where he may be found. These parameters are usually enough to assure accuracy.’ The Sister Superior paused, then said, ‘But you will not offer the information. Why can you not just tell us, Rayos? Does the heretic have some hold on you?’ ‘Sssss.’ The priest’s limbs were moving now, closing about her body as if to defend herself against assault. ‘My programming is uncorrupted. The Adepta Sororitas have no cause to assail me.’ Augusta paused, eyeing Rayos’ hood-shadowed, half-steel face. ‘We seek the witch,’ she said, ‘and we intend to find him.’ The Sister Superior’s hand was resting on her chainsword – whatever enforcers Rayos may have, she looked prepared to fight through all of them. Lucio had stopped looking around now, and the four Mili­tarum soldiers were paying tight attention. ‘The Sister Superior is correct,’ the inquisitor said. ‘We will see this mission completed.’ The roar of the bar clamoured round them; Melia laid her hand on her flamer, a prayer rising on her lips. But Rayos clicked and whirred, considering the pair of them. She leaned backwards in her chair, her limbs mantling higher. Then one claw pulled her black hood right off, revealing all of her once-human face, and the nest of augmetics that swarmed over it like a contagion. They stared. Rayos looked unclean, her flesh twisted and her metal corroding. As Melia suspected, she did not resemble any Mechanicus adept the Sisters had ever seen. In her remaining human cheek, her original cog-and-skull symbol had been obliterated by a long, red scar. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi commented, over the vox. ‘Must have been her home forge world.’ ‘What do you want?’ Istrix asked her. ‘In exchange for Zale’s location?’ Rayos’ mechadendrites flicked from the inquisitor to the Sister Superior and back, considering their unity and determination. Melia could almost imagine her assessing the information, calculating the threat. She said, ‘One of the Sororitas will remain with me until you have secured Scafidis Zale.’ ‘What?’ Augusta stepped forwards, her hands tightening on her weapons. ‘To what purpose?’ ‘As bodyguard,’ Rayos said. ‘If I reveal Zale’s location, there is a ninety-nine point six per cent chance that he will seek retribution. The Adepta Sororitas are known for faith that can defy witchery. This is my trade. If you wish to locate the heretic, you will grant me security.’ ‘We will make the deal.’ Istrix made a decisive gesture. ‘Sister Superior, one of your squad will volunteer.’ The words were an order. Augusta inhaled sharply, her armour creaking with the movement; Viola and Akemi exchanged a look. The priest wheezed again, a sound like straining bellows – she sounded almost like she was laughing. A clear space had spread out around the table and Melia could feel shadows lurking at its edges, bristling dark with threat. The Sister had no doubt that, if they turned on Rayos or tried to betray her, the resulting confrontation would be excessive. She heard herself say it: ‘I will stay.’ ‘Sister?’ Augusta turned, her face concerned. ‘I will stay,’ Melia said, again. ‘Sister Caia must remain with the inquisitor, and you will need Viola’s strength and Akemi’s knowledge. The success of this mission is the will of the Emperor,’ she kept her tone neutral, ‘and if I can serve Him best by remaining here, then I will do so.’ ‘You have great courage, Sister Melia,’ Istrix said, her smile thin and cold. ‘You have great courage,’ Augusta repeated. ‘To face this test alone is an act of both honour and bravery.’ She offered the sign of the aquila and a blessing. ‘Imperatoris vobiscum.’ Emperor be with you. The blue eye of the priest had observed the exchange with interest; the red one swivelled to focus on Melia, scanning her from head to foot. ‘The chances of successful retribution have lessened by a factor of three point three recurring – these parameters are acceptable. I must clarify accurate data. Inquisitor, Sister Superior, you will return here at 20:03:57, Solar time, when I will possess the information you require.’ ‘What guarantees do I have,’ Istrix said, ‘that you will not betray us?’ The priest placed her hood over her face and sat back, hissing. ‘You must calculate those odds,’ she said, ‘for yourself.’ Outside the repurposed tank, Augusta was finding herself increasingly disconcerted. They had been given no clear orders. They had walked blindly into an ambush. They were forbidden to open fire. And now this. Leaving a member of her squad behind was unthinkable – her Sisters fought, moved, as a unit. They had no Kimura, no Jatoya… And without Melia, they had no medicae, and no second. Augusta wondered why her Sister had volunteered, but the thought was too much. The Sister Superior was becoming more unsettled with every passing moment, with every order given and decision made… But, erratic behaviour or not, Istrix was the Emperor’s ­chosen, and her word was law. Levis est mihi. A prayer in her heart, Augusta walked like an automaton, her boots clanging with every step. Viola and Akemi flanked her like guards. The three of them stayed in tight formation as they followed Istrix back out onto the platform, and over towards the city. Ahead, Caia still walked with the inquisitor, but the set of the Sister’s red shoulders was tense. Melia was her closest friend, and it was easy to see that Caia was angry. At the back, the four Militarum soldiers stayed silent, as if they dared not make a sound. At the city limits, however, and demarked by a chain-link metal fence, a crowd had gathered to watch. Eyes hungry and gleeful were observing their every movement. As if they were waiting for something. They didn’t wait long. Caia’s warning and the single shot came almost simultaneously; Augusta saw Istrix jolt, then slump sideways like a broken thing. Caia shouted, ‘Up there!’ The corporal’s lasrifle streaked fire across the darkness. But, on the high walkway, the cloaked figure was already vanishing from sight. Viola’s weapon was drawn, covering the city; Augusta and Akemi both aimed their bolters at the tank’s entranceway. The Militarum bristled lasrifles at the higher gantries. Nothing moved. Stuck out in the open, the group was coverless, and alone. Gazes still watched them from the town, avid and curious. Augusta could almost feel them, mustering their courage, their hatred and their fear – they bulged with resentment like some mutated growth. But would they dare attack? Bolter still in hand, she drew the chainsword with the other. Daring them. Caia had dropped to one knee beside the inquisitor. ‘She’s alive,’ she said, bio-scanner in hand. ‘By the grace of the Emperor, she’s alive. We need Melia…’ She stopped, twisting her words to a halt. Rufus, one of the Militarum group, called, ‘Sister! I can help!’ Augusta gave a curt nod. ‘Go,’ the corporal told him, and the man ran forwards, pulling a medi-pack as he did so. Viola hadn’t moved; the muzzle of the heavy bolter still covered the crowd. Augusta could feel her fury; she was burning to pull the trigger. ‘Rayos must have betrayed us.’ Her tone was vicious. ‘This whole place stinks of corruption. We should go back in there and–’ ‘That is not our priority.’ Augusta cut her off. ‘Akemi, speak to Melia and secure her report. Corporal Mors, we need a defensible location. If the inquisitor dies while under our guard…’ Purposely, she let the implication hang. ‘Sister!’ Viola’s protest was angry. ‘Rayos–’ ‘Sister Viola!’ Augusta’s tone was a bark. ‘The inquisitor is alive. She is the word of the Emperor, and she must take precedence.’ She looked at her squad. ‘We will not abandon Sister Melia. But we need security – and now. Akemi, what’s the report from the Archeotech?’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I can’t reach Melia on the vox – I’m getting static.’ Throne! Augusta stopped herself cursing aloud. She was caught, thinking, praying, her whole body was alert with adrenaline – she could not abandon a member of her squad, but nor could she leave the injured inquisitor out in the open. A prayer curled in her heart; she needed guidance, under-standing… Levis est mihi… Show me to the Light! She had to make the decision. She said, ‘Keep trying. Mors – how well do you know the area? Can you find us a safe location?’ ‘I believe so, Sister,’ the corporal said. He had his rifle in hand, still scanning the upper catwalks. ‘The Mechanicus construct these platforms in repeating and regular patterns, and I know where one may be found.’ ‘Good man,’ Augusta said to him. ‘We will follow your lead. Can the inquisitor be moved?’ ‘The Emperor is with her, Sister Superior.’ Rufus was on his knees and holding a dressing to Istrix’s shoulder. ‘The wound is serious, but treatable. The hydrostatic shock has robbed her of consciousness. I can revive her–’ ‘Not here.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ The city’s crowd was getting larger now; they were starting to shift and seethe. Viola made a deliberate show of re-cocking the heavy bolter, the noise echoing from the tank like a challenge. Akemi kept her weapon trained on the tank’s hatch, though the bar had remained silent. Her voice in the vox continued, but there was no response to the call. Augusta checked her annoyance, and gave her orders. ‘Corporal, take point. Sister Caia, with the corporal. I will carry the inquisitor myself. Viola, guard our backs – and if anything tries to attack us, shoot it.’ Viola said, ‘Aye,’ and the word was like a promise of violence. They moved, low to the ground and at the double. Caia’s scanning enhanced the corporal’s local instincts and they made good speed, skirting the outer edges of the city and climbing down towards the lower platforms. It was darker down here, the lumens faltering, but it offered at least basic concealment. Suspended walkways creaked over the reeking water; the group moved as fast as it dared, all suit-lights turned off. The unconscious inquisitor hung in Augusta’s arms like a sacrifice, her scars glinting. She was heavy, but the Sister Superior’s power armour was enough to bear her easily. In the vox, Augusta offered a prayer – for Melia, for Istrix’s health and recovery. And for herself, for insight, for His wisdom to show her the way… Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… This mission was not turning out how they had expected. Soon, they left the noise of the town behind them. They could clearly hear their own boots and breathing, the hiss and seethe of the hungry, polluted waters. And, as they walked, Augusta’s prayers focused her thoughts, and she began to understand something. The Sister Superior did not doubt Istrix’s authenticity, nor her dedication to her target, yet still, her choices of action seemed odd. She came across as arrogant, though perhaps that was not so unusual. And she had willingly walked them out from the Munitorum depot, and straight into the nearest ambush… For what? So she could locate Rayos? Rayos herself had seemed genuine enough – a local boss, manipulating the people and powers around her to her own best advantage. Augusta had encountered such creatures before. She– ‘Here!’ The corporal’s deep voice sounded in the vox. ‘No movement,’ Caia confirmed, auspex back in her hand. ‘That doesn’t mean it’s empty,’ Augusta commented. ‘Secure the area.’ ‘Aye.’ Caia nodded at the corporal, and his heavy boot hammered the metal door. It spanked back against the side of the lift shaft, and Caia brought up her bolter to cover the space. Within was a cargo-lift, more than big enough to accommodate all of them, and with the added advantage of a second exit on the opposite side. Caia counted five and said, ‘Clear!’ ‘Very well, then,’ Augusta said. ‘We will regroup, and reload.’ As they moved in, and laid the inquisitor down, Rufus moved forward with his kit, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘She’s stable, yes?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then why don’t we let her sleep for a moment?’ Her tone was grim. ‘Keep an eye on her. Corporal Mors, I’ll need your full report.’ If this mission was to succeed, then the Sister Superior wanted to know everything.",

The platforms were larger, better maintained, and many of the tanks and reactors had been repurposed as habitats or saloons. Smoke curled in the air – tabac sticks and kyxa weed. Coloured signs gleamed in darkened corners, ­making offers that made Lucio nudge his fellows and snicker. But Istrix did not care. She ignored the graffiti, scratched in mockery over the cogs and skulls of the original forge world; she ignored the sharp gazes of the curious opportunists, ignored the surrounding bodies, looted and rotting. She walked through all of it with her conviction blazing fearlessly, like an aura. The Sisters, in their scarlet armour, followed her, pushing through the grubby people like a wash of blood through rust. And the four soldiers walked with them, their eyes everywhere. At last, the inquisitor stopped. She indicated a large, cylindrical tank, standing alone at the platform’s outer edge – a smeltorium, perhaps, from the corroding pipes beneath. A sequence of binary code was carved into its outside. And below it, scratched into the metal, was the word, ‘Archeotech’. ‘Sssss.’ The noise might have been laughter, but it was mechanical, and oddly flat. In the dim illumination of the tank’s interior, a hooded figure sat in a defended seat, its back to the curve of the wall. Before it, the place was packed, all shouting and fighting and the pounding of scratch-built metal tables; the air stank of piss and spirits. The figure, however, did not raise its hood to look. On the other side of the table, Istrix stood solid, arms folded. The five Sisters flanked her like icons. Ranged with them, the Militarum soldiers seemed somewhat distracted. Lucio was looking around, and casting a wistful gaze at the battered metal mugs. Melia left him to it. Her attention was on the figure itself, and its mantled, augmetic limbs. A tech-priest. A renegade. Its cloak was black, shimmering with an oily glisten, and it bore a cog-symbol unfamiliar to the Sisters. Its limbs clicked and twitched; one claw pulled back its hood just enough to reveal a semi-human, female face, a single bright blue eye. Her other eye was an extending metal lens, glinting with a red, augmetic glare, and her mechadendrites rippled this way and that, scanning Istrix, the Sisters and the soldiers, and the bar in every direction. Satisfied with the data she had assembled, she sat back and hissed again, the noise like releasing steam. ‘Rayos.’ The inquisitor picked up a mug, eyed the contents, and clanked it back down on the table. ‘Inquisitor.’ The word was emotionless, emerging in ticks and whirs. ‘There has been an eighty-six point seven per cent chance that you would come, seeking my input.’ ‘Your information is excellent,’ Istrix said. It was statement, rather than question. ‘And I know about you, also – the heretek Vius was not alone in his desire to plunder the mysteries of Lycheate.’ The hood cocked to one side, the movement precise. ‘Vius is gone, his data held only in memory.’ The bar heaved and roared. From somewhere, there came singing, coarse and ragged like a shanty; the tables clattered in rhythm. Istrix said, ‘I wish to trade.’ Rayos let out another hiss. ‘My trade is forty-two point two per cent information, twenty-one point three per cent machine parts, and eleven point four per cent ores and minerals. The remainder can be defined as “unusual”, where that definition is taken from–’ ‘I’m looking for a man called Scafidis Zale,’ Istrix said, with a thin smile. ‘You either know where he is, or you can tell me where he may be found.’ The tech-priest sat back, her augmetic eye twisting as she focused upon Istrix’s face. ‘I can access this data,’ she said, at last. ‘But its release requires a very specific exchange.’ Istrix glanced pointedly at the Sisters that surrounded her, and leaned her knuckles on the table. The seemingly casual movement dropped her symbol from the front of her robes. It swayed there, glinting. ‘It’s not a request.’ The priest hissed again, the noise thoughtful. All of her mechadendrites had swivelled upwards to focus on the leaning figure. ‘You have…’ she paused, ‘…no authority here. And you do not have sufficient force of arms. Releasing this information may place my life at risk, and I will not offer you this data without a suitable reciprocal exchange.’ She turned away, as if the interview was closed. Melia found herself wondering if she’d try to throw them out. What binary messages were stealing out, even now, across the air? The Sister looked around for enforcers, but could see nothing obvious. ‘Inquisitor, with your permission?’ Augusta took a half-step forwards. Istrix nodded and stood upright, her arms folded. Augusta said, ‘Answer me, Rayos, yes or no – do you know the location of the witch?’ The priest turned back, raised her chin as if curious. ‘I can offer a ninety-seven point six per cent probability on where he may be found. These parameters are usually enough to assure accuracy.’ The Sister Superior paused, then said, ‘But you will not offer the information. Why can you not just tell us, Rayos? Does the heretic have some hold on you?’ ‘Sssss.’ The priest’s limbs were moving now, closing about her body as if to defend herself against assault. ‘My programming is uncorrupted. The Adepta Sororitas have no cause to assail me.’ Augusta paused, eyeing Rayos’ hood-shadowed, half-steel face. ‘We seek the witch,’ she said, ‘and we intend to find him.’ The Sister Superior’s hand was resting on her chainsword – whatever enforcers Rayos may have, she looked prepared to fight through all of them. Lucio had stopped looking around now, and the four Mili­tarum soldiers were paying tight attention. ‘The Sister Superior is correct,’ the inquisitor said. ‘We will see this mission completed.’ The roar of the bar clamoured round them; Melia laid her hand on her flamer, a prayer rising on her lips. But Rayos clicked and whirred, considering the pair of them. She leaned backwards in her chair, her limbs mantling higher. Then one claw pulled her black hood right off, revealing all of her once-human face, and the nest of augmetics that swarmed over it like a contagion. They stared. Rayos looked unclean, her flesh twisted and her metal corroding. As Melia suspected, she did not resemble any Mechanicus adept the Sisters had ever seen. In her remaining human cheek, her original cog-and-skull symbol had been obliterated by a long, red scar. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi commented, over the vox. ‘Must have been her home forge world.’ ‘What do you want?’ Istrix asked her. ‘In exchange for Zale’s location?’ Rayos’ mechadendrites flicked from the inquisitor to the Sister Superior and back, considering their unity and determination. Melia could almost imagine her assessing the information, calculating the threat. She said, ‘One of the Sororitas will remain with me until you have secured Scafidis Zale.’ ‘What?’ Augusta stepped forwards, her hands tightening on her weapons. ‘To what purpose?’ ‘As bodyguard,’ Rayos said. ‘If I reveal Zale’s location, there is a ninety-nine point six per cent chance that he will seek retribution. The Adepta Sororitas are known for faith that can defy witchery. This is my trade. If you wish to locate the heretic, you will grant me security.’ ‘We will make the deal.’ Istrix made a decisive gesture. ‘Sister Superior, one of your squad will volunteer.’ The words were an order. Augusta inhaled sharply, her armour creaking with the movement; Viola and Akemi exchanged a look. The priest wheezed again, a sound like straining bellows – she sounded almost like she was laughing. A clear space had spread out around the table and Melia could feel shadows lurking at its edges, bristling dark with threat. The Sister had no doubt that, if they turned on Rayos or tried to betray her, the resulting confrontation would be excessive. She heard herself say it: ‘I will stay.’ ‘Sister?’ Augusta turned, her face concerned. ‘I will stay,’ Melia said, again. ‘Sister Caia must remain with the inquisitor, and you will need Viola’s strength and Akemi’s knowledge. The success of this mission is the will of the Emperor,’ she kept her tone neutral, ‘and if I can serve Him best by remaining here, then I will do so.’ ‘You have great courage, Sister Melia,’ Istrix said, her smile thin and cold. ‘You have great courage,’ Augusta repeated. ‘To face this test alone is an act of both honour and bravery.’ She offered the sign of the aquila and a blessing. ‘Imperatoris vobiscum.’ Emperor be with you. The blue eye of the priest had observed the exchange with interest; the red one swivelled to focus on Melia, scanning her from head to foot. ‘The chances of successful retribution have lessened by a factor of three point three recurring – these parameters are acceptable. I must clarify accurate data. Inquisitor, Sister Superior, you will return here at 20:03:57, Solar time, when I will possess the information you require.’ ‘What guarantees do I have,’ Istrix said, ‘that you will not betray us?’ The priest placed her hood over her face and sat back, hissing. ‘You must calculate those odds,’ she said, ‘for yourself.’ Outside the repurposed tank, Augusta was finding herself increasingly disconcerted. They had been given no clear orders. They had walked blindly into an ambush. They were forbidden to open fire. And now this. Leaving a member of her squad behind was unthinkable – her Sisters fought, moved, as a unit. They had no Kimura, no Jatoya… And without Melia, they had no medicae, and no second. Augusta wondered why her Sister had volunteered, but the thought was too much. The Sister Superior was becoming more unsettled with every passing moment, with every order given and decision made… But, erratic behaviour or not, Istrix was the Emperor’s ­chosen, and her word was law. Levis est mihi. A prayer in her heart, Augusta walked like an automaton, her boots clanging with every step. Viola and Akemi flanked her like guards. The three of them stayed in tight formation as they followed Istrix back out onto the platform, and over towards the city. Ahead, Caia still walked with the inquisitor, but the set of the Sister’s red shoulders was tense. Melia was her closest friend, and it was easy to see that Caia was angry. At the back, the four Militarum soldiers stayed silent, as if they dared not make a sound. At the city limits, however, and demarked by a chain-link metal fence, a crowd had gathered to watch. Eyes hungry and gleeful were observing their every movement. As if they were waiting for something. They didn’t wait long. Caia’s warning and the single shot came almost simultaneously; Augusta saw Istrix jolt, then slump sideways like a broken thing. Caia shouted, ‘Up there!’ The corporal’s lasrifle streaked fire across the darkness. But, on the high walkway, the cloaked figure was already vanishing from sight. Viola’s weapon was drawn, covering the city; Augusta and Akemi both aimed their bolters at the tank’s entranceway. The Militarum bristled lasrifles at the higher gantries. Nothing moved. Stuck out in the open, the group was coverless, and alone. Gazes still watched them from the town, avid and curious. Augusta could almost feel them, mustering their courage, their hatred and their fear – they bulged with resentment like some mutated growth. But would they dare attack? Bolter still in hand, she drew the chainsword with the other. Daring them. Caia had dropped to one knee beside the inquisitor. ‘She’s alive,’ she said, bio-scanner in hand. ‘By the grace of the Emperor, she’s alive. We need Melia…’ She stopped, twisting her words to a halt. Rufus, one of the Militarum group, called, ‘Sister! I can help!’ Augusta gave a curt nod. ‘Go,’ the corporal told him, and the man ran forwards, pulling a medi-pack as he did so. Viola hadn’t moved; the muzzle of the heavy bolter still covered the crowd. Augusta could feel her fury; she was burning to pull the trigger. ‘Rayos must have betrayed us.’ Her tone was vicious. ‘This whole place stinks of corruption. We should go back in there and–’ ‘That is not our priority.’ Augusta cut her off. ‘Akemi, speak to Melia and secure her report. Corporal Mors, we need a defensible location. If the inquisitor dies while under our guard…’ Purposely, she let the implication hang. ‘Sister!’ Viola’s protest was angry. ‘Rayos–’ ‘Sister Viola!’ Augusta’s tone was a bark. ‘The inquisitor is alive. She is the word of the Emperor, and she must take precedence.’ She looked at her squad. ‘We will not abandon Sister Melia. But we need security – and now. Akemi, what’s the report from the Archeotech?’ ‘Nothing, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘I can’t reach Melia on the vox – I’m getting static.’ Throne! Augusta stopped herself cursing aloud. She was caught, thinking, praying, her whole body was alert with adrenaline – she could not abandon a member of her squad, but nor could she leave the injured inquisitor out in the open. A prayer curled in her heart; she needed guidance, under-standing… Levis est mihi… Show me to the Light! She had to make the decision. She said, ‘Keep trying. Mors – how well do you know the area? Can you find us a safe location?’ ‘I believe so, Sister,’ the corporal said. He had his rifle in hand, still scanning the upper catwalks. ‘The Mechanicus construct these platforms in repeating and regular patterns, and I know where one may be found.’ ‘Good man,’ Augusta said to him. ‘We will follow your lead. Can the inquisitor be moved?’ ‘The Emperor is with her, Sister Superior.’ Rufus was on his knees and holding a dressing to Istrix’s shoulder. ‘The wound is serious, but treatable. The hydrostatic shock has robbed her of consciousness. I can revive her–’ ‘Not here.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ The city’s crowd was getting larger now; they were starting to shift and seethe. Viola made a deliberate show of re-cocking the heavy bolter, the noise echoing from the tank like a challenge. Akemi kept her weapon trained on the tank’s hatch, though the bar had remained silent. Her voice in the vox continued, but there was no response to the call. Augusta checked her annoyance, and gave her orders. ‘Corporal, take point. Sister Caia, with the corporal. I will carry the inquisitor myself. Viola, guard our backs – and if anything tries to attack us, shoot it.’ Viola said, ‘Aye,’ and the word was like a promise of violence. They moved, low to the ground and at the double. Caia’s scanning enhanced the corporal’s local instincts and they made good speed, skirting the outer edges of the city and climbing down towards the lower platforms. It was darker down here, the lumens faltering, but it offered at least basic concealment. Suspended walkways creaked over the reeking water; the group moved as fast as it dared, all suit-lights turned off. The unconscious inquisitor hung in Augusta’s arms like a sacrifice, her scars glinting. She was heavy, but the Sister Superior’s power armour was enough to bear her easily. In the vox, Augusta offered a prayer – for Melia, for Istrix’s health and recovery. And for herself, for insight, for His wisdom to show her the way… Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… This mission was not turning out how they had expected. Soon, they left the noise of the town behind them. They could clearly hear their own boots and breathing, the hiss and seethe of the hungry, polluted waters. And, as they walked, Augusta’s prayers focused her thoughts, and she began to understand something. The Sister Superior did not doubt Istrix’s authenticity, nor her dedication to her target, yet still, her choices of action seemed odd. She came across as arrogant, though perhaps that was not so unusual. And she had willingly walked them out from the Munitorum depot, and straight into the nearest ambush… For what? So she could locate Rayos? Rayos herself had seemed genuine enough – a local boss, manipulating the people and powers around her to her own best advantage. Augusta had encountered such creatures before. She– ‘Here!’ The corporal’s deep voice sounded in the vox. ‘No movement,’ Caia confirmed, auspex back in her hand. ‘That doesn’t mean it’s empty,’ Augusta commented. ‘Secure the area.’ ‘Aye.’ Caia nodded at the corporal, and his heavy boot hammered the metal door. It spanked back against the side of the lift shaft, and Caia brought up her bolter to cover the space. Within was a cargo-lift, more than big enough to accommodate all of them, and with the added advantage of a second exit on the opposite side. Caia counted five and said, ‘Clear!’ ‘Very well, then,’ Augusta said. ‘We will regroup, and reload.’ As they moved in, and laid the inquisitor down, Rufus moved forward with his kit, but Augusta held up a hand. ‘She’s stable, yes?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then why don’t we let her sleep for a moment?’ Her tone was grim. ‘Keep an eye on her. Corporal Mors, I’ll need your full report.’ If this mission was to succeed, then the Sister Superior wanted to know everything.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX Sister Melia sat with her back to the old smeltorium’s wall, the rigid metal scraping against the edges of her armour. Beside her, Rayos paid her no further attention, hissing and clicking over the pile of trade-pieces and data-slates that had been left on her table. Some she passed to the little brass analyser beside her; others were carefully measured with callipers and claws. Her cogitator clicked away to itself, presumably keeping some sort of running tally. Melia watched, oddly fascinated, and wondered what information flowed between the two of them. In her heart, however, she offered the Litany of Divine Guidance; she prayed for strength, and for clarity. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. And then, the bar went quiet. Melia looked up. A lone figure had pushed through the crowd, stilling fights and rowdy singing both. He was strong and tanned, gold-eyed and brown-haired. He wore no armour, no symbols; he carried no weapons. Yet he commanded his audience with a flourish like pure confidence. As he came closer, Melia could feel a pressure swelling in her mind, like creepers growing through her ears. She continued to pray. As if he could hear her, the man met her gaze. He had a smile that gave him tan-lines, crinkles round his eyes that offered humour, warmth and mischief. ‘Sister,’ he said, as he stopped at the table. ‘How charming.’ She lifted her chin; the pressure in her mind was growing worse. Her skull spasmed with agony, aching like it would split. Somewhere, she could hear the hissing of the Lautis daemons, feel their flame and fear– The priest raised a claw. ‘Desist.’ The man laughed, and the pressure was gone. Witch! Shuddering with revulsion, Melia was on her feet. She knew what had happened, knew exactly what – who – this man was. And she understood, in the very next instant, that Rayos had betrayed them, that she’d never had any intention of going through with the deal. Melia’s hand went for her flamer; she opened a channel in the vox but the signal was blocked. The bead in her ear crackled static. Weapon out, she pointed it at the newcomer. ‘Heretic!’ ‘Really, Sister.’ The man laughed. His tone was like his clothing, rich and warm. ‘The word is so crass, don’t you think? Please, call me Zale. And you will stand when I say, sit when I say, kneel when I say. Now put that away, and be quiet.’ With each word, Melia’s body jerked in response; she obeyed him like a marionette, her strings in his hands. As he gave the final order, however, she spat a prayer and surged forwards. One hand turned the table clean over, mugs and data-slates clattering to the floor; the other shoved the flamer right in his face. At the noise, there was an instant of silence, then whoops and cheers erupted around the bar. The man’s eyes narrowed, as if she’d surprised him. But he made no attempt to defend himself, or back away. ‘I wouldn’t,’ he told her softly, ‘if I were you.’ His eyes glittered; she could see whole worlds held in them, the sparkle of stars, the vast streams of the empyrean. The screaming, bloody heave of the warp that she’d seen through the mirror in the Lautis cathedral… Worlds, dying at the touch of Chaos. Softly, he said, ‘I know you have no fear of death, Sister. I know you would lay down your life to slay me, and everything else in this establishment. But I also know how this ends.’ Moons exploded in her vision; his words stroked her, their truth enthralling. ‘Istrix is a lunatic, you must have realised that by now.’ ‘She is a child of the Emperor.’ Melia snarled the words; her flamer hadn’t moved. ‘You spin treachery and illusion to gain your own ends. I will not suffer your life–’ ‘Sister, please,’ he said. Smiling, he raised a hand and pushed the weapon down and out of the way. ‘That’s quite enough. If I told you to, you would strip off your armour and bathe in the waters of Lycheate like they were a font.’ Melia reeled, staggering and silent. The words were a lance of pain in her forebrain, a white-hot flare going off behind her eyes. She fell back onto the bench. Beside her, Rayos had stood up, and a delicate, unfolding claw was picking up her fallen goods. Secreting some of the higher-value pieces in places under her cloak, she said to Zale, ‘Our trade is concluded. You have the item you require. I will depart. I will not return to this location, the percentage chance of retaliation is unacceptable. I will join you at the requested appointment. We will conclude our business.’ ‘Of course.’ Zale offered her a bow like a flourish, then turned back to Melia. He extended his arm as if he expected her to take it. And Melia found herself obeying the gesture, her body moving like a servitor’s, clumsy and painful. She fought to clear her thoughts. She wanted to demand: what appointment, what business? She wanted to pull her flamer, execute this smirking heretic, this betraying tech-priest. She wanted to howl the hymnal aloud, to purge this world of its faithless and its unbelievers… But she could not; her head hurt and her limbs ground like rust. She tried to pray, struggled to recall the words. ‘Domine… libra…’ They came forth in pieces, in shards of pain through her hard-clenched teeth. ‘I feel your battle,’ Zale told her, smiling. Explosions were still going off in her head – the moons detonating, over and over again, their pieces spinning, spinning in the void. ‘But you’re weak, Melia, unsure of your own strength and position. You know this.’ He chuckled, the sound lush. ‘Please understand, Istrix and I go back a very long way, and I can usually… shall we say, predict… her moves.’ His words were sharply amused, as if at some private joke. ‘But the Adepta Sororitas? Now, that’s a ploy I hadn’t expected. And one that’s interesting, a genuine challenge.’ He picked up one of the metal mugs, drained its contents, put it down again. ‘And so, I had to have you – my security, my coin, my Imperial scrip. The card up my sleeve, if you like.’ His smile grew. ‘And, close-up, I can learn how your mind, your foolish faith, really works, Sister – and understand how to better the rest of your squad.’ Melia’s mind was fraying like old cloth. Her prayers were fading, her vision was full of detonations, and wonder, and beauty, and Ruin, and pain… She made herself speak, each word like a splinter of agony. ‘My life… will not save you. The Sisters of Battle… will not… be defeated. My squad… will shoot you.’ ‘Really?’ he said, and his brown eyes glittered like rusted manacles. ‘I think you’ll find… it’s just not that simple.’ ‘Sister Superior, I am under orders…’ Inside the lift, the corporal tailed into an uneasy silence, eyeing the fallen inquisitor. ‘To disobey those orders would be heresy. I would be shot. Or confined to the life of a gun-servitor–’ ‘The question is not difficult,’ Augusta said. They were short of time, and she needed Mors’ full story, needed to try to understand why the inquisitor’s behaviour was so peculiar. ‘I asked for your report. Where do you come from, Mors? How do you come to be on Lycheate? And how long have you been with Istrix?’ Leaving Caia and Viola on watch, Augusta and Akemi stood with their backs to the lift wall. Opposite them, on a long metal bench, the four members of the Militarum had stood down, and broken out their rations. They were sharing a canteen of water, and even Lucio had run out of banter. Rufus, the medicae and the oldest of the four, sat the closest to Istrix. He said, ‘Sister Superior, with all due respect…’ ‘Corporal,’ Augusta said, cutting straight across his words. ‘You will answer the question.’ The corporal had removed his helmet; despite the cold air, his dark skin glittered with sweat. He muttered something that might have been a prayer, then let out his breath in a plume like surrender. Swiftly, he explained how they had met Istrix when she had been scouting the planet for her quarry. She had been unaccompanied, working alone, and assaulted at the outskirts of the city. They had gone to help her, and she had immediately commanded their assistance in locating Zale. Several days later, after a short battle during which their lieutenant had lost his life, they’d cornered, and successfully wounded, the psyker. But Zale’s wound had been an illusion, the corporal told them. The witch had lured them in, and the battle had cost the life of the sergeant and of the other members of the squad. ‘Zale is extremely powerful,’ Mors said. ‘The illusions he creates are truly horrifying. Our squad… barely stood a chance.’ He trailed off into silence, frowning. ‘She didn’t fire.’ Adriene, her legs stretched out across the lift floor, looked up from her ration pack. ‘She had him, at gunpoint, out on the gantry, and she didn’t shoot him. She–’ ‘Private!’ the corporal snapped at her, cutting her dead. Augusta turned back to Mors. ‘Corporal, you will give me your full report, everything you’ve seen while you’ve been with the inquisitor.’ Her gaze did not let him go. ‘The success of this mission may depend upon your information.’ Mors paused for a moment, then he inhaled and straightened his shoulders. ‘Our squad died screaming,’ he said. ‘The inquisitor…’ His voice shook, he swiftly controlled himself. ‘Istrix hesitated, and the gantry collapsed. We lowered a line and pulled her free, but by then, Zale had already gone. Emperor forgive me, Sister, Adriene is correct – she had him at gunpoint, and she did not fire.’ Augusta nodded, but said nothing more aloud. Over their private channel, she continued, ‘Sisters. What do you make of this?’ ‘He seems terrified,’ Akemi said. ‘They all do.’ ‘He’s not telling us everything,’ Caia commented. Viola suggested, ‘We can force it out of him.’ Augusta replied, ‘We will do no such thing–’ She stopped as feet raced past outside; they all turned, hands on weapons. The rasp of an engine sounded at the waterline. ‘Very well,’ Augusta said. ‘We have not secured Sister Melia, and I fear we are out of time.’ She eyed Mors for a moment, then looked down at the unconscious inquisitor, her gaze exploring the careful latticework of scars. ‘One last question. You say she did not shoot Zale. So, why did Zale not end her life? He must have had the opportunity.’ Adriene frowned at her rations, Lucio counted his ammo. ‘He used to be her pupil,’ Mors said, and Augusta nodded. ‘And there still seems to be some… strange connection between them, Sister, some compulsion or madness that drives them both–’ ‘Corporal.’ Augusta’s voice was steel. ‘Has she fallen?’ At the question, Mors drew in his breath, and the others stopped to stare, their gazes wide. Carefully, the corporal said, ‘I have seen nothing to prove so, Sister. Only her… singular devotion to securing her target.’ Augusta exhaled, her prayer tangling round her exasperation. If the inquisitor had fallen to Ruin, then the Sisters’ path would have been clear, but still they had no explanation for Istrix’s peculiar behaviour. The Sister Superior had a need for guidance, for His light that had shown her Subul, and the way to the daemon… Domine deduc… But there was no clarity, here, no definite answer. Frustrated, she let her hand rest on her chainsword, solid and strong. More than anything, she wanted to hear the song of its rasp, to solve these endless questions with the glory of the litany and the roar of pure combat… By the Throne! All her life, Augusta had trusted to two things – her faith, and her weapons. And, all her life, they had been the same – she raised her voice to the God-Emperor, and she slew His foes. But this! She was beginning to believe that Istrix did not intend the witch’s death – and everything in the Sister Superior’s training baulked at that knowledge. The witch should be purged. He needed to die. Yet Mors was right, there seemed to be some deeper game here, some twisted, emotional connection that she did not understand. It made Istrix dangerous, unpredictable – and it brought the entire success of the mission into doubt. Had Istrix fallen to the darkness? She would not be the first inquisitor to have been consumed by the powers she pursued. But if Istrix was the presence of the God-Emperor, then her word was law, and to open fire upon her would be pure heresy. Augusta and her entire squad would offer their lives in Repentance. Somewhere, the Sister Superior could still feel the jagged edges of her darkness – see the stikk-bomb that had slain Kimura, the clang of the axe that had broken Jatoya like a doll. Melia, volunteering to stay with Rayos. Upon Ordination, the Sisters of her Order offered a prayer… ‘Imperator illam possedit me precor. In omnibus meis actionibus et officiorum. Omnium cogitationes et opera. Et ego armis exceptus…’ Emperor, I pray that you will utterly possess me. In all of my duties and actions. In all of my thoughts and deeds. I am your weapon and your vessel… Guide me, my Emperor, she prayed. I cannot get this wrong. With the words, she lifted her chin, and made her decision. Yes, she must follow the inquisitor’s orders… But she did not intend to do so blindly. ‘Corporal,’ she said. ‘You withstood Zale’s mental assault, correct?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘You will run reconnaissance on the smeltorium, and locate Sister Melia. Your squad will stay with me. If you are right about this connection, then Zale will be closer than we think.’ The corporal saluted. ‘Aye.’ ‘Remember, corporal, this is recon, not a combat mission. Do not call attention to yourself, and do not engage. Stick to the upper levels. Return to the smeltorium, and watch.’ ‘Aye.’ She nodded, approving of this young man, his choices and his discipline. ‘Go with His grace, corporal. And return with His wisdom.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ He offered her a salute. As he slipped out of the far door of the cargo lift, however, he turned back. ‘Sister Superior,’ he said. ‘I do have… one last suspicion.’ ‘Go on.’ ‘It is my belief,’ he said, ‘that Zale is up to something. I think he’s here for a reason.’ ‘Then we will prevent that reason,’ Augusta told him flatly. ‘One way or another, the witch must die.’ He was in her head. Like a burrower, like the stain of Chaos. Like the fear wielded by the Lautis daemons. Like a necron scarab, its claws scratch-scratching with the taint of steel and death. Stubbornly, Melia held to her chant, the litany – like her novitiate childhood – both comfort and reflex. She had been taught this as a girl, kneeling beside her dormitorium bunk and praying to that tiny, carved effigy… she knew how to face fear, how to surpass witchery. And yet it still lingered, like an ache in the back of her skull. Images tumbled like the edges of rocks. She was in the belly of the Kyrus, in command of the squad. Kimura was there, and Jatoya; they described a perfect skirmish manoeuvre along the flickering-dark corridor. Domine, libra nos… Words lingered like hope, but she could not quite grasp them. The Sisters moved onwards, the font-waters of Lycheate sloshing at their feet. Bodies bobbed past them – Sister Felicity Albani, the missionary Tanichus, the tech-priest Jencir, his flayed skull all covered in blood. Phantoms rose from her past, and they laughed like Scafidis Zale, lush and rich and warm. You are to blame, Melia. Jatoya was twice the warrior you are. Look at your errors! Look at them! In the Kyrus’ corridor, she saw the bomb. She went to cry out, but it was too late – the detonation was colossal, and the flame was livid and hungry for life. The impact of it threw her backwards. Debris creaked and screamed; her visor was smudged with smoke. There was a hole ripped in the side of the ship – it was injured and in pain, crying out. She tried to pray for it, but she was not the priest it needed, and Rayos laughed at her ignorance. The wind shrieked past her, wreckage and bodies all sucked out into the void. She caught a last look at Jatoya’s face as the Sister scrabbled madly at the wounded metal, and was gone. The woman’s still-armoured body spun outwards into nothing, and her voice cried the Requiem. Dies Irae, Dies Illa! +You did this,+ Zale told her. +You failed. You’re weak, inadequate. The Emperor does not want you, Melia. You do not deserve Him. And you know it!+ She held to her hymn, angry, stubborn, refusing to give up. She filled her mind with the chapel on Ophelia VII, with His image, His light. She cried denial, her defiance loud: ‘Thou shalt not suffer the witch to live!’ With a crack like the split in a window, the image splintered, and was gone. Startled, she blinked. Her head was pounding. She was still in the bar. Scafidis Zale was before her with his arms folded, and one elegant eyebrow raised. ‘Impressive,’ he said, the word almost a compliment. ‘You’re going to take more of my concentration than I’d realised.’ She faced him, continuing to recite the litany. She repeated the words like a lifeline, over and over, wreathed in anger and defiance. ‘Domine, libra nos. ‘Domine, libra nos…’ ‘Makes a change to name, rank, and serial number, I suppose.’ He laughed at his own humour, then chewed the inside of his lip, thinking. ‘Domine, libra nos…’ ‘You listen to me, Sister Melia.’ He stepped forwards, cupping her cheek in his hand with a gesture that seemed almost affectionate. He bore several rings and his gold eyes shone like Sol itself. ‘We are going to take a little walk, and explore some of the glories that this planet has to offer. Not its people – you’ve already seen too many of those – but its secrets. Some of the things that the Mechanicus believed broken, and that the heretek Vius, in his cleverness and his determination, managed to discover. The things that Rayos has been… moving… for me.’ He stroked his thumb over her cheek. ‘You may fight me if you wish, Sister, but the outcome will be the same. Your Emperor cannot save you.’ His smile was pure charm. ‘Not from me.’ ‘Domine, libra nos.’ Melia kept praying as the images broke over her again.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX Sister Melia sat with her back to the old smeltorium’s wall, the rigid metal scraping against the edges of her armour. Beside her, Rayos paid her no further attention, hissing and clicking over the pile of trade-pieces and data-slates that had been left on her table. Some she passed to the little brass analyser beside her; others were carefully measured with callipers and claws. Her cogitator clicked away to itself, presumably keeping some sort of running tally. Melia watched, oddly fascinated, and wondered what information flowed between the two of them. In her heart, however, she offered the Litany of Divine Guidance; she prayed for strength, and for clarity. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. And then, the bar went quiet. Melia looked up. A lone figure had pushed through the crowd, stilling fights and rowdy singing both. He was strong and tanned, gold-eyed and brown-haired. He wore no armour, no symbols; he carried no weapons. Yet he commanded his audience with a flourish like pure confidence. As he came closer, Melia could feel a pressure swelling in her mind, like creepers growing through her ears. She continued to pray. As if he could hear her, the man met her gaze. He had a smile that gave him tan-lines, crinkles round his eyes that offered humour, warmth and mischief. ‘Sister,’ he said, as he stopped at the table. ‘How charming.’ She lifted her chin; the pressure in her mind was growing worse. Her skull spasmed with agony, aching like it would split. Somewhere, she could hear the hissing of the Lautis daemons, feel their flame and fear– The priest raised a claw. ‘Desist.’ The man laughed, and the pressure was gone. Witch! Shuddering with revulsion, Melia was on her feet. She knew what had happened, knew exactly what – who – this man was. And she understood, in the very next instant, that Rayos had betrayed them, that she’d never had any intention of going through with the deal. Melia’s hand went for her flamer; she opened a channel in the vox but the signal was blocked. The bead in her ear crackled static. Weapon out, she pointed it at the newcomer. ‘Heretic!’ ‘Really, Sister.’ The man laughed. His tone was like his clothing, rich and warm. ‘The word is so crass, don’t you think? Please, call me Zale. And you will stand when I say, sit when I say, kneel when I say. Now put that away, and be quiet.’ With each word, Melia’s body jerked in response; she obeyed him like a marionette, her strings in his hands. As he gave the final order, however, she spat a prayer and surged forwards. One hand turned the table clean over, mugs and data-slates clattering to the floor; the other shoved the flamer right in his face. At the noise, there was an instant of silence, then whoops and cheers erupted around the bar. The man’s eyes narrowed, as if she’d surprised him. But he made no attempt to defend himself, or back away. ‘I wouldn’t,’ he told her softly, ‘if I were you.’ His eyes glittered; she could see whole worlds held in them, the sparkle of stars, the vast streams of the empyrean. The screaming, bloody heave of the warp that she’d seen through the mirror in the Lautis cathedral… Worlds, dying at the touch of Chaos. Softly, he said, ‘I know you have no fear of death, Sister. I know you would lay down your life to slay me, and everything else in this establishment. But I also know how this ends.’ Moons exploded in her vision; his words stroked her, their truth enthralling. ‘Istrix is a lunatic, you must have realised that by now.’ ‘She is a child of the Emperor.’ Melia snarled the words; her flamer hadn’t moved. ‘You spin treachery and illusion to gain your own ends. I will not suffer your life–’ ‘Sister, please,’ he said. Smiling, he raised a hand and pushed the weapon down and out of the way. ‘That’s quite enough. If I told you to, you would strip off your armour and bathe in the waters of Lycheate like they were a font.’ Melia reeled, staggering and silent. The words were a lance of pain in her forebrain, a white-hot flare going off behind her eyes. She fell back onto the bench. Beside her, Rayos had stood up, and a delicate, unfolding claw was picking up her fallen goods. Secreting some of the higher-value pieces in places under her cloak, she said to Zale, ‘Our trade is concluded. You have the item you require. I will depart. I will not return to this location, the percentage chance of retaliation is unacceptable. I will join you at the requested appointment. We will conclude our business.’ ‘Of course.’ Zale offered her a bow like a flourish, then turned back to Melia. He extended his arm as if he expected her to take it. And Melia found herself obeying the gesture, her body moving like a servitor’s, clumsy and painful. She fought to clear her thoughts. She wanted to demand: what appointment, what business? She wanted to pull her flamer, execute this smirking heretic, this betraying tech-priest. She wanted to howl the hymnal aloud, to purge this world of its faithless and its unbelievers… But she could not; her head hurt and her limbs ground like rust. She tried to pray, struggled to recall the words. ‘Domine… libra…’ They came forth in pieces, in shards of pain through her hard-clenched teeth. ‘I feel your battle,’ Zale told her, smiling. Explosions were still going off in her head – the moons detonating, over and over again, their pieces spinning, spinning in the void. ‘But you’re weak, Melia, unsure of your own strength and position. You know this.’ He chuckled, the sound lush. ‘Please understand, Istrix and I go back a very long way, and I can usually… shall we say, predict… her moves.’ His words were sharply amused, as if at some private joke. ‘But the Adepta Sororitas? Now, that’s a ploy I hadn’t expected. And one that’s interesting, a genuine challenge.’ He picked up one of the metal mugs, drained its contents, put it down again. ‘And so, I had to have you – my security, my coin, my Imperial scrip. The card up my sleeve, if you like.’ His smile grew. ‘And, close-up, I can learn how your mind, your foolish faith, really works, Sister – and understand how to better the rest of your squad.’ Melia’s mind was fraying like old cloth. Her prayers were fading, her vision was full of detonations, and wonder, and beauty, and Ruin, and pain… She made herself speak, each word like a splinter of agony. ‘My life… will not save you. The Sisters of Battle… will not… be defeated. My squad… will shoot you.’ ‘Really?’ he said, and his brown eyes glittered like rusted manacles. ‘I think you’ll find… it’s just not that simple.’ ‘Sister Superior, I am under orders…’ Inside the lift, the corporal tailed into an uneasy silence, eyeing the fallen inquisitor. ‘To disobey those orders would be heresy. I would be shot. Or confined to the life of a gun-servitor–’ ‘The question is not difficult,’ Augusta said. They were short of time, and she needed Mors’ full story, needed to try to understand why the inquisitor’s behaviour was so peculiar. ‘I asked for your report. Where do you come from, Mors? How do you come to be on Lycheate? And how long have you been with Istrix?’ Leaving Caia and Viola on watch, Augusta and Akemi stood with their backs to the lift wall. Opposite them, on a long metal bench, the four members of the Militarum had stood down, and broken out their rations. They were sharing a canteen of water, and even Lucio had run out of banter. Rufus, the medicae and the oldest of the four, sat the closest to Istrix. He said, ‘Sister Superior, with all due respect…’ ‘Corporal,’ Augusta said, cutting straight across his words. ‘You will answer the question.’ The corporal had removed his helmet; despite the cold air, his dark skin glittered with sweat. He muttered something that might have been a prayer, then let out his breath in a plume like surrender. Swiftly, he explained how they had met Istrix when she had been scouting the planet for her quarry. She had been unaccompanied, working alone, and assaulted at the outskirts of the city. They had gone to help her, and she had immediately commanded their assistance in locating Zale. Several days later, after a short battle during which their lieutenant had lost his life, they’d cornered, and successfully wounded, the psyker. But Zale’s wound had been an illusion, the corporal told them. The witch had lured them in, and the battle had cost the life of the sergeant and of the other members of the squad. ‘Zale is extremely powerful,’ Mors said. ‘The illusions he creates are truly horrifying. Our squad… barely stood a chance.’ He trailed off into silence, frowning. ‘She didn’t fire.’ Adriene, her legs stretched out across the lift floor, looked up from her ration pack. ‘She had him, at gunpoint, out on the gantry, and she didn’t shoot him. She–’ ‘Private!’ the corporal snapped at her, cutting her dead. Augusta turned back to Mors. ‘Corporal, you will give me your full report, everything you’ve seen while you’ve been with the inquisitor.’ Her gaze did not let him go. ‘The success of this mission may depend upon your information.’ Mors paused for a moment, then he inhaled and straightened his shoulders. ‘Our squad died screaming,’ he said. ‘The inquisitor…’ His voice shook, he swiftly controlled himself. ‘Istrix hesitated, and the gantry collapsed. We lowered a line and pulled her free, but by then, Zale had already gone. Emperor forgive me, Sister, Adriene is correct – she had him at gunpoint, and she did not fire.’ Augusta nodded, but said nothing more aloud. Over their private channel, she continued, ‘Sisters. What do you make of this?’ ‘He seems terrified,’ Akemi said. ‘They all do.’ ‘He’s not telling us everything,’ Caia commented. Viola suggested, ‘We can force it out of him.’ Augusta replied, ‘We will do no such thing–’ She stopped as feet raced past outside; they all turned, hands on weapons. The rasp of an engine sounded at the waterline. ‘Very well,’ Augusta said. ‘We have not secured Sister Melia, and I fear we are out of time.’ She eyed Mors for a moment, then looked down at the unconscious inquisitor, her gaze exploring the careful latticework of scars. ‘One last question. You say she did not shoot Zale. So, why did Zale not end her life? He must have had the opportunity.’ Adriene frowned at her rations, Lucio counted his ammo. ‘He used to be her pupil,’ Mors said, and Augusta nodded. ‘And there still seems to be some… strange connection between them, Sister, some compulsion or madness that drives them both–’ ‘Corporal.’ Augusta’s voice was steel. ‘Has she fallen?’ At the question, Mors drew in his breath, and the others stopped to stare, their gazes wide. Carefully, the corporal said, ‘I have seen nothing to prove so, Sister. Only her… singular devotion to securing her target.’ Augusta exhaled, her prayer tangling round her exasperation. If the inquisitor had fallen to Ruin, then the Sisters’ path would have been clear, but still they had no explanation for Istrix’s peculiar behaviour. The Sister Superior had a need for guidance, for His light that had shown her Subul, and the way to the daemon… Domine deduc… But there was no clarity, here, no definite answer. Frustrated, she let her hand rest on her chainsword, solid and strong. More than anything, she wanted to hear the song of its rasp, to solve these endless questions with the glory of the litany and the roar of pure combat… By the Throne! All her life, Augusta had trusted to two things – her faith, and her weapons. And, all her life, they had been the same – she raised her voice to the God-Emperor, and she slew His foes. But this! She was beginning to believe that Istrix did not intend the witch’s death – and everything in the Sister Superior’s training baulked at that knowledge. The witch should be purged. He needed to die. Yet Mors was right, there seemed to be some deeper game here, some twisted, emotional connection that she did not understand. It made Istrix dangerous, unpredictable – and it brought the entire success of the mission into doubt. Had Istrix fallen to the darkness? She would not be the first inquisitor to have been consumed by the powers she pursued. But if Istrix was the presence of the God-Emperor, then her word was law, and to open fire upon her would be pure heresy. Augusta and her entire squad would offer their lives in Repentance. Somewhere, the Sister Superior could still feel the jagged edges of her darkness – see the stikk-bomb that had slain Kimura, the clang of the axe that had broken Jatoya like a doll. Melia, volunteering to stay with Rayos. Upon Ordination, the Sisters of her Order offered a prayer… ‘Imperator illam possedit me precor. In omnibus meis actionibus et officiorum. Omnium cogitationes et opera. Et ego armis exceptus…’ Emperor, I pray that you will utterly possess me. In all of my duties and actions. In all of my thoughts and deeds. I am your weapon and your vessel… Guide me, my Emperor, she prayed. I cannot get this wrong. With the words, she lifted her chin, and made her decision. Yes, she must follow the inquisitor’s orders… But she did not intend to do so blindly. ‘Corporal,’ she said. ‘You withstood Zale’s mental assault, correct?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘You will run reconnaissance on the smeltorium, and locate Sister Melia. Your squad will stay with me. If you are right about this connection, then Zale will be closer than we think.’ The corporal saluted. ‘Aye.’ ‘Remember, corporal, this is recon, not a combat mission. Do not call attention to yourself, and do not engage. Stick to the upper levels. Return to the smeltorium, and watch.’ ‘Aye.’ She nodded, approving of this young man, his choices and his discipline. ‘Go with His grace, corporal. And return with His wisdom.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ He offered her a salute. As he slipped out of the far door of the cargo lift, however, he turned back. ‘Sister Superior,’ he said. ‘I do have… one last suspicion.’ ‘Go on.’ ‘It is my belief,’ he said, ‘that Zale is up to something. I think he’s here for a reason.’ ‘Then we will prevent that reason,’ Augusta told him flatly. ‘One way or another, the witch must die.’ He was in her head. Like a burrower, like the stain of Chaos. Like the fear wielded by the Lautis daemons. Like a necron scarab, its claws scratch-scratching with the taint of steel and death. Stubbornly, Melia held to her chant, the litany – like her novitiate childhood – both comfort and reflex. She had been taught this as a girl, kneeling beside her dormitorium bunk and praying to that tiny, carved effigy… she knew how to face fear, how to surpass witchery. And yet it still lingered, like an ache in the back of her skull. Images tumbled like the edges of rocks. She was in the belly of the Kyrus, in command of the squad. Kimura was there, and Jatoya; they described a perfect skirmish manoeuvre along the flickering-dark corridor. Domine, libra nos… Words lingered like hope, but she could not quite grasp them. The Sisters moved onwards, the font-waters of Lycheate sloshing at their feet. Bodies bobbed past them – Sister Felicity Albani, the missionary Tanichus, the tech-priest Jencir, his flayed skull all covered in blood. Phantoms rose from her past, and they laughed like Scafidis Zale, lush and rich and warm. You are to blame, Melia. Jatoya was twice the warrior you are. Look at your errors! Look at them! In the Kyrus’ corridor, she saw the bomb. She went to cry out, but it was too late – the detonation was colossal, and the flame was livid and hungry for life. The impact of it threw her backwards. Debris creaked and screamed; her visor was smudged with smoke. There was a hole ripped in the side of the ship – it was injured and in pain, crying out. She tried to pray for it, but she was not the priest it needed, and Rayos laughed at her ignorance. The wind shrieked past her, wreckage and bodies all sucked out into the void. She caught a last look at Jatoya’s face as the Sister scrabbled madly at the wounded metal, and was gone. The woman’s still-armoured body spun outwards into nothing, and her voice cried the Requiem. Dies Irae, Dies Illa! +You did this,+ Zale told her. +You failed. You’re weak, inadequate. The Emperor does not want you, Melia. You do not deserve Him. And you know it!+ She held to her hymn, angry, stubborn, refusing to give up. She filled her mind with the chapel on Ophelia VII, with His image, His light. She cried denial, her defiance loud: ‘Thou shalt not suffer the witch to live!’ With a crack like the split in a window, the image splintered, and was gone. Startled, she blinked. Her head was pounding. She was still in the bar. Scafidis Zale was before her with his arms folded, and one elegant eyebrow raised. ‘Impressive,’ he said, the word almost a compliment. ‘You’re going to take more of my concentration than I’d realised.’ She faced him, continuing to recite the litany.

Your Emperor cannot save you.’ His smile was pure charm. ‘Not from me.’ ‘Domine, libra nos.’ Melia kept praying as the images broke over her again.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The stimm brought Istrix upright in a rush, her face pale, her green eyes briefly wild. She took in her surroundings with a single, blazing-cold glance, and came straight to her feet. She swayed, her hand going to her field-dressing, and her missing pauldron. Instinctively, Rufus offered her assistance but she refused. Outrage flared from her shoulders as she turned around. She snapped, ‘Where is Corporal Mors?’ Augusta replied, ‘I sent him on reconnaissance.’ ‘What?’ The inquisitor spun back to her. ‘Are you deficient, Sister? I did not give you leave to take the initiative. To make my decisions for me. You disobey an order of mine again, and you will find yourself wielding a very different selection of weaponry.’ A flicker of spittle flew from her lips as she thundered, ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘Ma’am.’ Startled by her vehemence, Augusta offered her a curt salute, but Istrix had already turned away, scornfully dismissive, to retrieve her shoulder-armour. Her voice in the vox demanded the corporal’s immediate return, and on the double. The Sister Superior held herself still. Mors had given her new questions to consider, but as yet, she did not know the answers. Beside her, Akemi shifted uncomfortably, her armour creaking; the soldiers were exchanging uneasy glances, though they said nothing. But Istrix paid none of them the slightest attention. Instead, as she fastened her pauldron back into place, her gaze fell on the ration-crumbs, and narrowed. ‘How long,’ she asked them, the words like cracking ice, ‘did you leave me unconscious?’ ‘Moments only.’ Augusta offered a penitent prayer to accompany the lie. ‘We roused you as soon–’ ‘But long enough to pause for a rest?’ Istrix’s tone was savage. ‘Ma’am–’ ‘Enough!’ The inquisitor silenced the Sister Superior with a bark that was almost a bellow. Her face was flushed, now, showing the neat lines of scars. She looked like she would split along those lines, detonating into flying fragments of furious flesh. Augusta inhaled. She prayed for calm, and for clarity. For truth. ‘We will hold this location until Mors returns,’ the inquisitor said, her sarcasm as bitter and lethal as a lake of acid. ‘And then we will move out for our meeting with Rayos.’ ‘Inquisitor, we do not know that Rayos can be trusted.’ Privately, Augusta thanked the Emperor Himself for her years of training, for the canoness’ strict discipline that enabled her to keep her voice controlled. ‘We cannot reach Sister Melia. And, dependent upon Mors’ intelligence, I suggest that an assault upon the tech-priest’s location would be the best option.’ ‘I have already told you, Sister.’ Istrix ground crumbs under her boot. ‘You will not open fire without my orders.’ Viola tensed; Augusta could see the young woman’s gauntleted hands tighten on the heavy bolter, though she did not turn around. ‘When this mission is over,’ Istrix continued, ‘I will be accompanying you back to Ophelia VII. I will be commanding an audience with your canoness, and I will be delivering my report on your performance and behaviour… in person.’ Augusta was beginning to feel the same sharp, furious sense of helplessness that she’d felt in the shuttle, the same sense of being tumbled by forces outside her control. And, down here, she liked it even less. ‘Corporal Mors, incoming.’ The man’s voice was accompanied by the impact of boots on the top of the lift. Weapons twitched; Istrix gave one of the soldiers a curt nod. Smoothly, Adriene stood on the bench to open the hatch, while Rufus and Lucio raised their rifles for cover. ‘Clear,’ she said. Mors’ long figure dropped into the lift, his rifle over his shoulder. Istrix waited for him, arms folded. ‘Well?’ ‘Ma’am.’ He glanced from inquisitor to Sister, and offered a salute. ‘Your hunch was correct, Sister. Rayos has betrayed us, and Zale was at the smeltorium.’ Istrix bridled, pulling herself up to her full height. ‘Go on, corporal,’ Augusta said. ‘We saw Zale speak to Rayos and leave, heading towards the other side of the city. He had back-up, two armed city thugs, and he had Sister Melia with him. She was unhurt, though she seemed to be dazed.’ In the vox, Viola commented darkly, ‘Told you so.’ ‘Viola.’ Augusta’s disciplinary bark was sharp. ‘That’s enough.’ The younger Sister shifted again, but said nothing. Another issue: Viola had a strong will, and stronger opinions. She’d disobeyed her orders once before. And with the increasing pressure that Istrix was placing upon the squad… This was all going to detonate, and soon. The Sister Superior said, ‘We should target them now, inquisitor. The heretic must die.’ Mors glanced from face to face, as if trying to understand the tension. His expression was pained. Her orders had already killed his squadmates – presumably he was wondering if she would end up killing all of them. ‘We’ve got another problem,’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Incoming cityside.’ Outside the cargo-lift, the city’s shifting, curious crowd was closing on the Sisters’ location. A glut of filthy figures – many of them deformed or subhuman – were weapons-in-hands and loitering, their grins eager. Their leader looked orkish, big and green and tusked; its face was half metal and it wore a freebooter’s distinctive hat. There were soldiers, worn ragged, gangers in various muddy colours, knots of mutants with robes and appendages, and at least one of the shadowy Mechanicus renegades, all cloaked and clawed. Its visible flesh was stained and rotting, and it was flanked by the scuttle and rumble of clumsy servitors. The group looked ramshackle, but determined. ‘They must have followed the corporal,’ Istrix said. The words were cutting, and pointedly aimed at Augusta. ‘I fear, ma’am,’ Augusta returned, ‘that our force has been all too visible. They’re scavengers, they must be after our wargear.’ Viola added, ‘And the reputation to go with it.’ ‘We should attack,’ Augusta said, again. ‘We must eliminate Zale before we lose him.’ ‘We will move out,’ Istrix told her shortly, ‘and we will follow Zale’s route. But we will not engage him – not yet. I want to know where he’s going.’ When they moved, the crowd from the city followed them. Not close, but close enough. The people – if that’s what they were – carried anger and fear, a rising need to obliterate or control these icons of Imperial faith that had landed in their midst. The swell of them came on like a slow ripple of hunger, the freebooter ork at the centre. Augusta knew that they were no match for four fully-armed Sisters, backed by the lasrifles of the Militarum soldiers, but they seemed content to hang back, and they made good use of the local cover. It seemed like they were waiting for something – some signal to attack. Yet Istrix still didn’t care; still, she was focused only forwards. She kept moving, and she left the fully armed horde, loitering, at their backs. With every junction they passed, Augusta’s frustration grew stronger. Powerful priorities pulled the Sister Superior in opposite directions – to doubt the inquisitor was heresy, and yet those doubts grew with every moment. Augusta needed to stop and think and pray; to follow her faith, and her honour. To follow His Guidance. Yet it seemed even more lost here than it had been in the catacombs of the Lautis cathedral. Is she Your vessel? Or is she corrupt? Istrix’s forward motion remained utterly, obsessively relentless. Behind Augusta, Sister Viola walked at the rear, her heavy bolter daring the crowd to come closer. Caia stayed in the lead, auspex and weapon both in hand; Akemi still flanked the Sister Superior. The youngest Sister’s fingers twitched, as though she missed her little silver fetish. To Augusta, this was looking more and more crazed – perhaps Mors had been right, and this was all some elaborate game… Everything has an Operandus. The lesson she had been teaching her Sisters – but if there was a pattern here, then she still could not see it. Behind them, the horde hung back, mocking. They loosed the occasional shout, pieces of chants like the edges of some violent promise. They still kept their distance, but Augusta knew: if they saw the right opportunity, they would surge forwards and tear the inquisitor’s entire retinue to screaming, bloody pieces… Or – and the Sister Superior laid her hand on her chain­sword – they’d make the attempt. The group moved on. Soon, they passed a familiar bottleneck – walkway, tank and crane, all identical to the previous layout. It bore an embossed numerical sequence in exactly the same place, and the scored-out cog-symbol of Triplex Phall. Augusta said, her tone short, ‘We should hold this location, inquisitor. If we take a stand here–’ ‘We will keep moving.’ Istrix did not even bother to pause. ‘I have already said – I need to know where they’re going.’ Under her breath, Augusta let herself curse. But the inquisitor’s boots did not stop. They clanged onwards, continuing with her inexorable, headlong march. It seemed as though some fierce, white flame pulled her, some need she would not stoop to explain. The Sister Superior was becoming more and more convinced that the inquisitor’s mission was not just the will of the Emperor. Like Viola, she felt rising frustration; she wanted to loose her rage at the dirty brown sky, to open fire at last, to sing until this entire ruined world knew the wrath of the Emperor Himself, and of His Adepta Sororitas… ‘Inquisitor,’ she said. ‘A question.’ Istrix answered her with a short laugh, a snort as cold as the frozen air. She said, her tone almost patronising, ‘You wish to know about Zale?’ She glanced back, her odd smile making her scars crease and wrinkle. ‘I have been chasing him a very long time. He knows he cannot overpower me, either physically or psychically. He is not strong enough to face me himself. So, I think he’s found himself another force.’ Another force. By the Throne! With an effort, the Sister Superior stopped herself swearing aloud. ‘Something must be left here…’ The words were Akemi’s, though Istrix did not react to her outspokenness. ‘Something like the Breacher. Something that the Mechanicus forgot, or overlooked.’ The inquisitor said nothing; she seemed too intent upon the realisation of her goal. ‘Which explains,’ Augusta commented, ‘why he was dealing with Rayos. She must have found something, uncovered something…’ The remainder of her sentence remained unspoken: And we have walked straight into this… you are walking us straight into this… ‘So, we’re expecting an ambush?’ Viola echoed her thought, her voice edged with fervour. Augusta felt an urge to grin – the release of pure combat would be welcome – but she had to keep her head. This was insane. They were surrounded. They had enemies both ahead and behind. And if there was a force ahead of them, then they had no idea of its armament or capability. And yet, they would just walk straight into its centre? Was Istrix that fixated with Scafidis Zale? Augusta noticed the corporal frowning. He caught her looking and turned away, lifting his chin and flattening his expression. Her suspicion and annoyance peaked. In the Emperor’s name, this was idiocy. ‘Inquisitor,’ she said, trying again. ‘We must remove the threat at our backs. If we are expecting battle–’ ‘Sister. Superior.’ The words were a nasty hiss and Istrix stopped dead, turning sharply on her heel and coming back to face Augusta, her expression incensed. ‘Your continued insubordination is intolerable. If you question my decisions one more time, I will execute you for heresy, right here and right now.’ Specks of froth flew from the corners of her mouth as she ­thunder­ed, ‘Do you understand?’ ‘Ma’am.’ Augusta controlled her shock; she stayed still, held her ground. She felt her squad shift, tense and startled. She could see Akemi’s wide-eyed expression; feel Viola’s silent surge of outrage. See the corporal’s frown returning. ‘Hold strong.’ Her voice in the vox was soft, but still an order. ‘Sisters, with me… It Imperator, docere patientia mea. Docete me observationis. Docete me de hostibus meis scientia.’ Emperor, teach me patience. Teach me observation. Teach me the knowledge of my enemies. It was the Litany of Learning – one from the schola, and not usually something sung in the field. But, her mind aflare with the sudden idea, she continued to the correct stanza… ‘Ut plene intelligere, quod de ratione tuum hostes Tuos, et adducere ut ut iustitia Tua.’ That I may understand fully the nature of Your foes, and that I may bring them to Your justice. Under the visor, she saw Akemi’s face relax, saw the faintest flicker as the youngest Sister caught her meaning. Viola’s rage began to ease. They joined her in the hymn, Caia too. Their voices were soft, their harmonies perfect and pure. And it was enough. August felt herself relax – He was with them. And her suspicions had been conveyed, properly and discreetly; her squad would be wary, and would be alert for her orders. Much as her every military nerve told her to disobey the fanatical inquisitor, she still – absolutely – could not. Their suspicion and their unity would have to be enough. Until the Emperor chose to make His wishes clear. Melia clung to herself with the very edges of her strength and her faith, resisting the yawning chasm. In her mind, a single image: the great, stained glassaic window in the chapel of her Order. In her throat, a single litany: From the blasphemy of the fallen… Zale had rounded up a couple of gangers and had taken her from the smeltorium, out past the back of the city and up, always up, along the higher levels and the platforms of the city’s outskirts. She’d stumbled after him, all her focus and energy going into keeping him from controlling her mind; nothing left to stop herself being propelled forwards by a rust-smelling oaf on either side. She could only repeat the thing that held her sanity, her lifeline, over and over again. Domine, libra nos. He had her in his mental grip like she were a bolt, gripped by a tech-priest, like she were a round, caught in the chamber of her own weapon. She held on, but only just. Around her, the landscape of Lycheate slowly changed. She was only dimly aware of it – an ongoing blur of dust and oxidation at the outsides of her vision – but the platforms were opening out now, becoming much larger and offering landing pads, turning tables, and huge, mecha-scaffolds. There were colossal lifts, rusted into their shafts, titanic cranes that stretched skywards, creaking in the cold night wind. Wherever they were going, it was going to be vast. +Curious, are you?+ His voice sounded in her head. It was the warmth of it that was the hardest thing – the soft coax that said trust me, I am here for you. She did not respond. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. In among Lycheate’s steelworks, she could see flickers of phantom-images. The death-green glow of the necrons on Psamitek; the clicking seethe of the tyranids that she and Caia had faced on their very first mission out of the schola. She saw Caia die, over and over, yet she knew that it had never happened. She saw the Lautis orks tear her Sister to pieces, saw the daemon’s flesh hounds bite into her limbs and worry at them, ripping them free from their sockets and gnawing on the bones. She saw that Caia was still alive as they did so, watching her own arms and legs being dragged, bloody, out through the nave of the ruined cathedral. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. She saw the Convent Sanctorum on Ophelia VII; saw the canoness hit the floor as the first detonations rocked the building. She was running though the cloisters, her robes, red and black and white, flapping behind her. She was calling for her Sisters to do battle – but they refused her authority. They did not recognise her, and even as the dark blurs of warships robbed the light from the windows, she knew that the failure was her own. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. ‘Here.’ It took her a moment to realise that Zale had spoken aloud. Her head was so full of the destruction of the convent that she had to blink to realise that she stood in bright, magnesium-white lumens, and that the space around her was colossal, draughty and absolutely ice-cold. Wherever they were, it was taking enough of Zale’s attention that she could grind her gaze into focus and look round. By His Holy Light! She barely had the wit to keep the exclamation to herself, to remain reciting the litany so he had no suspicion. She was not a good dissembler – it was lying, dishonourable – but a pure mote of sense told her to keep her awareness concealed. If she could. Only the litany. Only the lifeline. They stood at the upper balcony of a huge, half-collapsed factorum. Below them, the floor stretched out into darkness. Its machines were silent, rows and rows of production lines, all dead and rusted into place. There were shrines and pict-screens at their ends, data towers that stretched towards the crumbling roof, fallen grav-pallets where products could be stacked and – presumably – taken to the hauler stations outside. This was where the life of the planet’s doomed moons had once been manifest upon its surface, the place where the tech-priests had rolled out their forces… And those forces were still here. Once lost. Now rediscovered. She could see them, lurking at the factorum’s edges, silent and rust-splotched, but looming huge in the shadows… the forgotten fighting machines of the departed Adeptus Mechanicus. Kataphrons – Destroyers and Breachers. Lines of kastelans. Waiting. This, she realised, was the place where Rayos would be meeting him. To offer her prayers to the Omnissiah – however a heretek would see Him… And to bring this force to life. A breath escaped her, a plume of white with which she gave herself away. ‘Awake, are we?’ Zale turned like some now-benign conqueror, opening his hands to let her witness his triumph. ‘And for just long enough to see what I have found here, and what I can muster. When Istrix comes for me – because she will, she has no choice – when she comes for me, this will be the very last thing she sees.’ +Finally!+ She heard his words in her head. +And I want her to witness this, Sister. I want her to know just how badly she’s failed. I need her to see this force, and to understand what I will do with it… +I need her last thought to be despair.+ His mental tones were gleeful, full of exultant celebration. And the images closed over her again with the rush of Lycheate’s filthy waters – and, this time, they came with the call of the moons’ distress signal, and the grind and batter that was pure, machine war. ‘You want…’ drowning, she struggled to find the words, ‘…revenge on your mistress…’ +Not just my mistress, Sister.+ His tone was deep, liquid-soft, and utterly lethal. +Like the heretek Vius before me, my call will reach out across the void.+ He smiled like the sun coming up. +I want all of them.+ She didn’t understand him, not clearly; the confusion was too great. Even the litany was fading now, as if he had rent it clean from her mind, thrown it down like some damaged convent tapestry, all torn to shreds. +Here we are,+ he said. +At last!+",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The stimm brought Istrix upright in a rush, her face pale, her green eyes briefly wild. She took in her surroundings with a single, blazing-cold glance, and came straight to her feet. She swayed, her hand going to her field-dressing, and her missing pauldron. Instinctively, Rufus offered her assistance but she refused. Outrage flared from her shoulders as she turned around. She snapped, ‘Where is Corporal Mors?’ Augusta replied, ‘I sent him on reconnaissance.’ ‘What?’ The inquisitor spun back to her. ‘Are you deficient, Sister? I did not give you leave to take the initiative. To make my decisions for me. You disobey an order of mine again, and you will find yourself wielding a very different selection of weaponry.’ A flicker of spittle flew from her lips as she thundered, ‘Do I make myself clear?’ ‘Ma’am.’ Startled by her vehemence, Augusta offered her a curt salute, but Istrix had already turned away, scornfully dismissive, to retrieve her shoulder-armour. Her voice in the vox demanded the corporal’s immediate return, and on the double. The Sister Superior held herself still. Mors had given her new questions to consider, but as yet, she did not know the answers. Beside her, Akemi shifted uncomfortably, her armour creaking; the soldiers were exchanging uneasy glances, though they said nothing. But Istrix paid none of them the slightest attention. Instead, as she fastened her pauldron back into place, her gaze fell on the ration-crumbs, and narrowed. ‘How long,’ she asked them, the words like cracking ice, ‘did you leave me unconscious?’ ‘Moments only.’ Augusta offered a penitent prayer to accompany the lie. ‘We roused you as soon–’ ‘But long enough to pause for a rest?’ Istrix’s tone was savage. ‘Ma’am–’ ‘Enough!’ The inquisitor silenced the Sister Superior with a bark that was almost a bellow. Her face was flushed, now, showing the neat lines of scars. She looked like she would split along those lines, detonating into flying fragments of furious flesh. Augusta inhaled. She prayed for calm, and for clarity. For truth. ‘We will hold this location until Mors returns,’ the inquisitor said, her sarcasm as bitter and lethal as a lake of acid. ‘And then we will move out for our meeting with Rayos.’ ‘Inquisitor, we do not know that Rayos can be trusted.’ Privately, Augusta thanked the Emperor Himself for her years of training, for the canoness’ strict discipline that enabled her to keep her voice controlled. ‘We cannot reach Sister Melia. And, dependent upon Mors’ intelligence, I suggest that an assault upon the tech-priest’s location would be the best option.’ ‘I have already told you, Sister.’ Istrix ground crumbs under her boot. ‘You will not open fire without my orders.’ Viola tensed; Augusta could see the young woman’s gauntleted hands tighten on the heavy bolter, though she did not turn around. ‘When this mission is over,’ Istrix continued, ‘I will be accompanying you back to Ophelia VII. I will be commanding an audience with your canoness, and I will be delivering my report on your performance and behaviour… in person.’ Augusta was beginning to feel the same sharp, furious sense of helplessness that she’d felt in the shuttle, the same sense of being tumbled by forces outside her control. And, down here, she liked it even less. ‘Corporal Mors, incoming.’ The man’s voice was accompanied by the impact of boots on the top of the lift. Weapons twitched; Istrix gave one of the soldiers a curt nod. Smoothly, Adriene stood on the bench to open the hatch, while Rufus and Lucio raised their rifles for cover. ‘Clear,’ she said. Mors’ long figure dropped into the lift, his rifle over his shoulder. Istrix waited for him, arms folded. ‘Well?’ ‘Ma’am.’ He glanced from inquisitor to Sister, and offered a salute. ‘Your hunch was correct, Sister. Rayos has betrayed us, and Zale was at the smeltorium.’ Istrix bridled, pulling herself up to her full height. ‘Go on, corporal,’ Augusta said. ‘We saw Zale speak to Rayos and leave, heading towards the other side of the city. He had back-up, two armed city thugs, and he had Sister Melia with him. She was unhurt, though she seemed to be dazed.’ In the vox, Viola commented darkly, ‘Told you so.’ ‘Viola.’ Augusta’s disciplinary bark was sharp. ‘That’s enough.’ The younger Sister shifted again, but said nothing. Another issue: Viola had a strong will, and stronger opinions. She’d disobeyed her orders once before. And with the increasing pressure that Istrix was placing upon the squad… This was all going to detonate, and soon. The Sister Superior said, ‘We should target them now, inquisitor. The heretic must die.’ Mors glanced from face to face, as if trying to understand the tension. His expression was pained. Her orders had already killed his squadmates – presumably he was wondering if she would end up killing all of them. ‘We’ve got another problem,’ Caia’s voice said. ‘Incoming cityside.’ Outside the cargo-lift, the city’s shifting, curious crowd was closing on the Sisters’ location. A glut of filthy figures – many of them deformed or subhuman – were weapons-in-hands and loitering, their grins eager. Their leader looked orkish, big and green and tusked; its face was half metal and it wore a freebooter’s distinctive hat. There were soldiers, worn ragged, gangers in various muddy colours, knots of mutants with robes and appendages, and at least one of the shadowy Mechanicus renegades, all cloaked and clawed. Its visible flesh was stained and rotting, and it was flanked by the scuttle and rumble of clumsy servitors. The group looked ramshackle, but determined. ‘They must have followed the corporal,’ Istrix said. The words were cutting, and pointedly aimed at Augusta. ‘I fear, ma’am,’ Augusta returned, ‘that our force has been all too visible. They’re scavengers, they must be after our wargear.’ Viola added, ‘And the reputation to go with it.’ ‘We should attack,’ Augusta said, again. ‘We must eliminate Zale before we lose him.’ ‘We will move out,’ Istrix told her shortly, ‘and we will follow Zale’s route. But we will not engage him – not yet. I want to know where he’s going.’ When they moved, the crowd from the city followed them. Not close, but close enough. The people – if that’s what they were – carried anger and fear, a rising need to obliterate or control these icons of Imperial faith that had landed in their midst. The swell of them came on like a slow ripple of hunger, the freebooter ork at the centre. Augusta knew that they were no match for four fully-armed Sisters, backed by the lasrifles of the Militarum soldiers, but they seemed content to hang back, and they made good use of the local cover. It seemed like they were waiting for something – some signal to attack. Yet Istrix still didn’t care; still, she was focused only forwards. She kept moving, and she left the fully armed horde, loitering, at their backs. With every junction they passed, Augusta’s frustration grew stronger. Powerful priorities pulled the Sister Superior in opposite directions – to doubt the inquisitor was heresy, and yet those doubts grew with every moment. Augusta needed to stop and think and pray; to follow her faith, and her honour. To follow His Guidance. Yet it seemed even more lost here than it had been in the catacombs of the Lautis cathedral. Is she Your vessel? Or is she corrupt? Istrix’s forward motion remained utterly, obsessively relentless. Behind Augusta, Sister Viola walked at the rear, her heavy bolter daring the crowd to come closer. Caia stayed in the lead, auspex and weapon both in hand; Akemi still flanked the Sister Superior. The youngest Sister’s fingers twitched, as though she missed her little silver fetish. To Augusta, this was looking more and more crazed – perhaps Mors had been right, and this was all some elaborate game… Everything has an Operandus. The lesson she had been teaching her Sisters – but if there was a pattern here, then she still could not see it. Behind them, the horde hung back, mocking. They loosed the occasional shout, pieces of chants like the edges of some violent promise. They still kept their distance, but Augusta knew: if they saw the right opportunity, they would surge forwards and tear the inquisitor’s entire retinue to screaming, bloody pieces… Or – and the Sister Superior laid her hand on her chain­sword – they’d make the attempt. The group moved on. Soon, they passed a familiar bottleneck – walkway, tank and crane, all identical to the previous layout. It bore an embossed numerical sequence in exactly the same place, and the scored-out cog-symbol of Triplex Phall. Augusta said, her tone short, ‘We should hold this location, inquisitor. If we take a stand here–’ ‘We will keep moving.’ Istrix did not even bother to pause. ‘I have already said – I need to know where they’re going.’ Under her breath, Augusta let herself curse. But the inquisitor’s boots did not stop. They clanged onwards, continuing with her inexorable, headlong march. It seemed as though some fierce, white flame pulled her, some need she would not stoop to explain. The Sister Superior was becoming more and more convinced that the inquisitor’s mission was not just the will of the Emperor. Like Viola, she felt rising frustration; she wanted to loose her rage at the dirty brown sky, to open fire at last, to sing until this entire ruined world knew the wrath of the Emperor Himself, and of His Adepta Sororitas… ‘Inquisitor,’ she said. ‘A question.’ Istrix answered her with a short laugh, a snort as cold as the frozen air. She said, her tone almost patronising, ‘You wish to know about Zale?’ She glanced back, her odd smile making her scars crease and wrinkle. ‘I have been chasing him a very long time. He knows he cannot overpower me, either physically or psychically. He is not strong enough to face me himself. So, I think he’s found himself another force.’ Another force. By the Throne! With an effort, the Sister Superior stopped herself swearing aloud. ‘Something must be left here…’ The words were Akemi’s, though Istrix did not react to her outspokenness. ‘Something like the Breacher. Something that the Mechanicus forgot, or overlooked.’ The inquisitor said nothing; she seemed too intent upon the realisation of her goal. ‘Which explains,’ Augusta commented, ‘why he was dealing with Rayos.

She felt her squad shift, tense and startled. She could see Akemi’s wide-eyed expression; feel Viola’s silent surge of outrage.

But, her mind aflare with the sudden idea, she continued to the correct stanza… ‘Ut plene intelligere, quod de ratione tuum hostes Tuos, et adducere ut ut iustitia Tua.’ That I may understand fully the nature of Your foes, and that I may bring them to Your justice.

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT The heights of the planet Lycheate were bitterly cold, and Augusta’s visor kept clogging with the icy dust. Up here, the great steelworks creaked and graunched; the walkways were thinner, and much more precarious. In places, they rounded the edges of the huge pipes like some poorly fenced steel precipice, and the wind made them shudder like they were still living, like the great strength of the Omnissiah had never forgotten His world. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Augusta was trying to picture the full industrial capability that this planet must once have offered – the noise, the motion, the heat, the stench, the steam and oil and fuel. The electric-lightning charges of the temples. The datastreams, alive in the air. The priests and the adepts, the helots, the bustling servitors, every­where, praying to their God and to the spirits of this vast production-world… All gone. Now there was just the cold, and the rust, and, high above, the shattered moon-fragments, reflecting the last red light of the unseen sun. ‘There,’ Istrix said, pointing with one ceramite arm. ‘That is our objective.’ Ahead of them: the largest open space that Augusta had yet seen. It appeared to be some huge hauler station – long lines of parallel rails stretched away from it, glinting in the debris-light, and there was a turntable at the centre, rusted into place. And, across on the far side, there rose the metal walls and blackly silhouetted chimneys of a crumbling factorum. She heard the corporal let out his breath; he must know, as she did, that if Zale had come here to muster an ambush force, it could be considerable… And there was still a seething, leering crowd of locals at their backs. Even now, the ork’s big boots were thumping up the final set of stairs. If that beast and its minions made it out onto the platform, there would be absolutely no cover. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said softly. ‘Estimation of numbers, ahead and behind.’ ‘Ahead, almost nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Five contacts, all located within the factorum itself. Behind us, maybe thirty, forty.’ The Sister paused, as if thinking, then said, ‘Sister Superior, there is a very good chance that the force within the factorum may not yet be in motion–’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta agreed. ‘I hear you.’ They were rapidly reaching the crisis point, the event horizon. Everything in Augusta’s military training told her to take the tactical decision and to remove the known threat, the one at their backs… …but to disobey the inquisitor was heresy. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris! The ork reached the top of the steps. It wore a skull-and-bones hat and a long coat with gold frogging down the front. Seeing them, it grinned, its fangs broken and yellow – fully smart enough to realise its own advantage. Her voice tense, her tone dangerous, Augusta said, ‘Inquisitor…’ The word came out sharper than she’d intended. Istrix almost snarled, ‘We will not demean ourselves, fighting this rabble. Now, move!’ They broke into a run. Behind them, the ork roared and stamped; the whole platform shook. Leaving the thing made Augusta’s blood rage even higher – she’d never fled an enemy in her entire life. And an ork! It went against everything she believed, everything she’d learned, against thirty years of her novitiate training and battle-experience– In her heart, her prayer rose higher – she needed His guidance, His forgiveness. She needed to turn and shoot that cursed beast before it reached them. She recalled her own darkness and doubts, recalled the stern severity of His statue upon the Kyrus… He does not forgive. The ork bellowed again – outrage or laughter, she couldn’t tell, and she almost stopped. This was madness – the inquisitor was surely demented; she would kill them all. Yet they would die in His service, and was it not their greatest honour to do so? The ork stopped. At the sudden cessation of its banging feet, Augusta glanced back. It was holding up one huge mitt, pausing its accompanying rabble. As the Sisters reached the double doors of the factorum, it raised its weapon… …a flash-memory, the rocket that hit the front of the cathedral, Augusta pushing Tanichus to the floor… Caia was at the doors; she was shouting, shoving them open. Augusta did not pause to think; she was through the doorway, almost pushing Akemi and the four soldiers in front of her, turning to make sure that Viola was safe… The ork pulled the trigger. Viola flung herself through the doors. And Augusta slammed them, hard, right in the missile’s painted face. The doors were heavy, good steel. The rocket smashed into them, detonating. The heat and impact were enough to send Augusta over, a heavy clang of metal on top of her. Something cracked; sickening pain shot though her shoulder. Throne! It felt broken; she needed Melia to look at it… It would have to wait. Shoving the fallen doors sideways with her good hand, she got back to her feet. They were in. They lived, they survived. Despite the pain, she offered a breath of prayer, a thanks for their lives, but that was all she had the time for. Because, in the hard, white light of the factorum, something was waiting for them. ‘And here you all are,’ said a voice. ‘You’ve caused quite the sensation.’ It was deep and rich and warm. It spoke of welcome, of forgiveness, of wealth and luxury, and it came from the factorum floor. From their vantage on the high, metal balcony, Augusta could see… Down there, in among the long, hulking corpses of the production machines, a single, strong-shouldered figure. He had a rogue trader look about him, long boots and decorous jacket, its fringed epaulettes glinting. And though he was both unarmed and unarmoured, she registered his physical beauty as if it were a bolter, strapped to his hip. It was a weapon, and one he knew how to use. Her mind said the words: Thou shalt not suffer… But, flicking on her preysight, she was also looking for something else – Caia had said five contacts. There should be others here: Sister Melia, two thugs, and the last one must surely be Rayos. She could not see them, though there were many pitch-black shadows at the outer limits of the room – corners concealed by great, empty hoppers or by the collapsed sections of wall. Her roll call in the vox did not secure a response. Scafidis Zale, however, had given the Sisters only a cursory glance. Istrix had stalked to the balcony’s edge, Caia still with her. The tall Sister towered over the inquisitor, yet Istrix’s passion gave her an intensity of focus that was almost tangible. She radiated… What? Rage? Zeal? ‘Interesting bodyguards, Issy,’ Zale said, his tone amused. ‘These ones have even survived. Smart game move, to secure the service of the Adepta Sororitas.’ He smiled, the expression wicked. ‘I confess – I hadn’t anticipated that one. You must have thought you’d beaten me.’ Augusta felt herself react to the compliment, strangled the feeling like some irksome gretchin. Don’t you play me, witch… In the vox, Viola said, ‘Sisters, we’ve got another problem.’ The Sister Superior glanced back. The bulging frame of the ork had appeared at the shattered doorway, though it had stopped, its weapon still in hand. A throng of smaller figures had clustered up to it, but none of them seemed to want to come closer. ‘Oh, don’t worry about them,’ Zale said, with an offhand wave. ‘They’re all part of the game. They were just making sure you got here safely.’ The words were out before Augusta could stop them: ‘You’re controlling them.’ Istrix rounded on her. ‘Be silent, Sister.’ The inquisitor’s response was immediate, her usually cold tones thrumming with something deeper. It felt like eagerness, like some sense of need. ‘Do not interfere.’ Interfere? The witch must die! Her fury rising like bile, Augusta closed her teeth on the retort. Her hand was on her bolter, craving to pull it free, to loose her rage at last. But Zale laughed aloud, the noise ringing in the emptiness like some perfect, chapel bell. ‘Still determined to end this yourself, my mistress. I should be flattered.’ Istrix cursed him, leaning further over the balcony as if she would spit fire. ‘You! Witch! Traitor! You could have served the Emperor in the greatest of capacities, you could have seen the streams of the empyrean, been one with the vastness of space! You could have had ships at your call, raised your voice and mind to the stars! You could have had every­thing! We could have had…’ ‘We.’ Zale cut her dead, his tone icing over. ‘You, Istrix. You. You, and your ambition, and your selfishness, and your greed. When my talents manifested, you didn’t want me to serve the Emperor. You wanted to present me to Him, gain favour and status. It was never about my future. It was always about you.’ ‘Liar!’ Istrix was raging, leaning over the balcony. ‘I cared for you, trained you! I would have given you everything–’ ‘Warpshit!’ Zale was losing his elegant calm; his rage, too, was rising. ‘You offered me nothing! Slavery! What choice did I have? To be captive, to be Penitent, or to be fodder? Fed to the Emperor to keep His soul alight? You gave me my ambition, Istrix – you taught it to me! And you know me better than to think I would ever surrender.’ His anger peaked, and subsided; he mustered a laugh. ‘And when I surpass you on every level.’ ‘How dare you!’ Istrix was thundering vehemence. ‘You accursed, filthy heretic!’ ‘Ah, Issy. You’ve followed me all the way here. And now you’ve lost, and you don’t even know it.’ Below them, somewhere in the black and hard-edged shadows, machines were grinding into motion. Augusta raised a prayer and it echoed from the metal roof like the call of a vox-coder trumpet. She thought she saw the flickering of an oil-black cloak, thought she heard the almost soundless tick-ticking of Rayos’ data-prayer. And then, in the outermost shadows of the factorum, joints and servos were moving, whining and scraping as they struggled through long years of rust. Akemi said, with a sudden of rush of intensity, ‘Kastelans.’ A second later, Caia added, ‘Two, nothing else is in motion.’ ‘Two is enough,’ Augusta commented, her tone flat. ‘You will not fire, Sisters,’ Istrix said. ‘This is pure intimidation, nothing more.’ ‘Intimidation!’ Viola snorted the word, cocking the heavy bolter. ‘We’re surrounded!’ Somewhere behind them, the big ork loosed a belch. Caught in a split-second of pure stillness, in the centre of the tornado of questions, between enemies before and behind, Augusta offered a final questioning prayer. Guide me! Is this woman Your vessel? It is Your work that she does? Or is she tainted? Touched by Ruin? Her darkness loomed at her, Subul’s mockery, her own doubts. And then she remembered, again, the Kyrus’ chapel… I am His daughter, my faith and weapons unquestioned, unquestionable; war is my craft and my study. I am strong. I am enough. And, as the kastelans ground slowly up to full speed, as Zale raised his hands, laughing at the success of his crafted drama, as the ork scratched its belly and kicked its way over the fallen doors, Augusta did the unthinkable. She offered her prayer. She made her choice. And she defied her orders. ‘Viola – fire!’ The thrice-blessed heavy bolter snarled into life with a sound like pure relief. Even as Istrix howled over the vox, the ork went backwards in a spray of gore, its hat flying free. The fallen doors clattered as it fell down on top of them. Viola shouted the words of the litany, less a hymn than a celebration of pure, focused violence – it had been building in the younger Sister ever since they’d landed on this cesspit of a planet. And Augusta could feel the same thing, that rising need to let it go. But not yet. ‘Cease fire!’ Istrix had turned on the Sisters, livid with incomprehension. ‘I gave you an order! Cease fire!’ Something in the Sister Superior wondered why the inquisitor was still so maniacally intent upon stopping them shooting – but there was no time for that now. She had defied her superior. What happened next – victory or Repentance – was the will of the Emperor. Bolter in her good hand, her shoulder still spiking with pain, Augusta continued to bark commands. ‘Caia, Akemi, take down the kastelans. Corporal, target the heretek – stop her activating anything else. And don’t let her out of your sight!’ She added her voice to Viola’s, felt the hearts of her squad rise – no more indecision, no more questions. Just the pure, clean rage of battle. From the fury… This was what she had been called for! Istrix was shrieking, spitting outraged fragments of words. She was hammering the heel of her free hand against the side of her skull – with a sudden, intuitive flash, Augusta understood something else, though she didn’t have time to realise it clearly. The roar of combat was already raging round her. With the big ork down, nothing else was tough enough to get past the bottleneck of the doorway. Yet they still came, shoving towards their own deaths as if they could not help it. Viola kept firing, and kept firing, short staccato bursts. She must know the truth as well as Augusta did – when she ran out of ammunition, they would be on her. And she had no Sister to cover her back. At the balcony’s edge, Caia and Akemi were shooting at the lumbering, grinding kastelans. The things were still slow, and they had no ranged weapons – thank the Emperor! – but they had fists the size of tanks and one thump would be enough to crush a slow-moving Sister to the floor. Beside the Sisters, the Militarum soldiers had switched targets. Under the corporal’s commands, they were firing at the kastelans’ joints and visors, though they were making little impact. Augusta could not see Rayos – the shadowy tech-priest had vanished. And she still could not see Melia. The Sister Superior aimed her bolter at the closest of the machines; saw its visor crack under the impact. She shot it again, and again. It jolted under the repeated rounds, but both machines were still moving, and faster with every step. They stood fourteen feet at their armoured shoulders and, if they reached the wall, Augusta realised, they could just pull the whole balcony clean onto the floor… Shards of pain still stabbed through her shoulder; she kept her injured arm to her chest and switched to shooting at the kastelans’ knee and elbow joints. Beside her, the corporal directed his squad to shoot at their fingers. He must have reached the same conclusion. Behind them, the heavy bolter clattered to a halt. Viola raised the hymnal with a rush of defiance – she was trying to reload, but the city’s thugs had been smart enough to use the bodies as cover. Now they were up and through the doorway; they were piling past the fallen ork, knowing that they had to stop her before she raised the weapon again. Augusta spun and bellowed, ‘Down!’ Viola dropped to a kneel, still reloading the bolter. The Sister Superior turned her fire on the crowd. She levelled short, controlled bursts as more and more of them tried to shove through the doorway. She couldn’t stop them all – the doorway was too wide and the piles of bodies too high. And Viola was just too close. The crowd closed around the red-armoured Sister, and she fought them back with her fists and feet, and the butt of her weapon. The Sister Superior stopped; she couldn’t shoot without the risk of hitting Viola. But they had another problem. The first of the kastelans had reached the balcony. Its joints still grinding in protest, it gripped the edge and started to pull. Creaking and groaning, the ancient metalwork began to split, and to come away from the wall. In her head, the Sister Superior could hear laughter, ringing and joyous – it tangled round her recitation of the hymnal. She sang louder, defiant, shutting it out. The second kastelan reached the balcony’s edge, took hold. With a protesting, metallic screech, the entire platform started to come loose. Unaware of her danger, Viola was moving like a dancer, fluid despite her armour, punching and kicking with a relentlessness that was pure, loosed savagery. Augusta had another flicker of memory: Jatoya’s physical strength, and the training she had given to all of them. She offered a fragment of thanks in a prayer. Akemi and Caia were still shooting at the kastelans. They could hardly miss; the machines were right on top of them, their blank armour-eyes staring out of their helmets like dead things. The Sisters were doing damage – sparks flew as rounds hit, the Militarum troopers were still firing – but it was not enough, never enough. The platform shrieked and screamed and juddered. Augusta felt it lurch as it came away from the wall. And then crashed to the floor with a noise like the end of the world, dumping all of them at the crisply booted feet of Scafidis Zale.",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT The heights of the planet Lycheate were bitterly cold, and Augusta’s visor kept clogging with the icy dust. Up here, the great steelworks creaked and graunched; the walkways were thinner, and much more precarious. In places, they rounded the edges of the huge pipes like some poorly fenced steel precipice, and the wind made them shudder like they were still living, like the great strength of the Omnissiah had never forgotten His world. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Augusta was trying to picture the full industrial capability that this planet must once have offered – the noise, the motion, the heat, the stench, the steam and oil and fuel. The electric-lightning charges of the temples. The datastreams, alive in the air. The priests and the adepts, the helots, the bustling servitors, every­where, praying to their God and to the spirits of this vast production-world… All gone. Now there was just the cold, and the rust, and, high above, the shattered moon-fragments, reflecting the last red light of the unseen sun. ‘There,’ Istrix said, pointing with one ceramite arm. ‘That is our objective.’ Ahead of them: the largest open space that Augusta had yet seen. It appeared to be some huge hauler station – long lines of parallel rails stretched away from it, glinting in the debris-light, and there was a turntable at the centre, rusted into place. And, across on the far side, there rose the metal walls and blackly silhouetted chimneys of a crumbling factorum. She heard the corporal let out his breath; he must know, as she did, that if Zale had come here to muster an ambush force, it could be considerable… And there was still a seething, leering crowd of locals at their backs. Even now, the ork’s big boots were thumping up the final set of stairs. If that beast and its minions made it out onto the platform, there would be absolutely no cover. ‘Caia,’ Augusta said softly. ‘Estimation of numbers, ahead and behind.’ ‘Ahead, almost nothing,’ Caia said. ‘Five contacts, all located within the factorum itself. Behind us, maybe thirty, forty.’ The Sister paused, as if thinking, then said, ‘Sister Superior, there is a very good chance that the force within the factorum may not yet be in motion–’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta agreed. ‘I hear you.’ They were rapidly reaching the crisis point, the event horizon. Everything in Augusta’s military training told her to take the tactical decision and to remove the known threat, the one at their backs… …but to disobey the inquisitor was heresy. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris! The ork reached the top of the steps. It wore a skull-and-bones hat and a long coat with gold frogging down the front. Seeing them, it grinned, its fangs broken and yellow – fully smart enough to realise its own advantage. Her voice tense, her tone dangerous, Augusta said, ‘Inquisitor…’ The word came out sharper than she’d intended. Istrix almost snarled, ‘We will not demean ourselves, fighting this rabble. Now, move!’ They broke into a run. Behind them, the ork roared and stamped; the whole platform shook. Leaving the thing made Augusta’s blood rage even higher – she’d never fled an enemy in her entire life. And an ork! It went against everything she believed, everything she’d learned, against thirty years of her novitiate training and battle-experience– In her heart, her prayer rose higher – she needed His guidance, His forgiveness. She needed to turn and shoot that cursed beast before it reached them. She recalled her own darkness and doubts, recalled the stern severity of His statue upon the Kyrus… He does not forgive. The ork bellowed again – outrage or laughter, she couldn’t tell, and she almost stopped. This was madness – the inquisitor was surely demented; she would kill them all. Yet they would die in His service, and was it not their greatest honour to do so? The ork stopped. At the sudden cessation of its banging feet, Augusta glanced back. It was holding up one huge mitt, pausing its accompanying rabble. As the Sisters reached the double doors of the factorum, it raised its weapon… …a flash-memory, the rocket that hit the front of the cathedral, Augusta pushing Tanichus to the floor… Caia was at the doors; she was shouting, shoving them open. Augusta did not pause to think; she was through the doorway, almost pushing Akemi and the four soldiers in front of her, turning to make sure that Viola was safe… The ork pulled the trigger. Viola flung herself through the doors. And Augusta slammed them, hard, right in the missile’s painted face. The doors were heavy, good steel. The rocket smashed into them, detonating. The heat and impact were enough to send Augusta over, a heavy clang of metal on top of her. Something cracked; sickening pain shot though her shoulder. Throne! It felt broken; she needed Melia to look at it… It would have to wait. Shoving the fallen doors sideways with her good hand, she got back to her feet. They were in. They lived, they survived.

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE In thick, slow motion, Sister Melia watched everything. She was concealed beneath the shadow of a vast and silent hopper – she couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. She was not restrained, but a heavy fog of lassitude had soaked into her limbs and her thoughts. It had robbed her of any energy, and left her listless and dull. And there was something she’d forgotten, something… Something like a light, maybe, but just beyond her field of vision. She watched the balcony as it fell, watched the creaking, groaning metal as it collapsed to the floor. She saw the four scarlet-armoured figures as they fell with it. One rolled straight back to its feet, two others got up more slowly. The last one landed with a huge, metal door smashing down on top of it, edge-first. It did not move again. A flicker of concern went through Melia’s soul, but it soon faded, lost to the grey. Her distress was too nebulous, like trying to grip smoke – she understood that the red figures were important, but she couldn’t remember why. Domine, libra nos…? The words lingered, like some echo of her past. To either side of her, the two gangers were grinning, watching the fight like it was some sort of gang battle. Whenever Zale spoke, they snickered obediently; he’d had no need to give them orders. As the kastelans moved towards the tumble of fallen figures, each ganger smacked his fist into his opposite palm, eager for more violence. They moved like servitors, mindless – but she could no more have drawn her flamer on them than she could have reached for her hidden fleur-de-lys blade… Her gauntleted hand twitched in her lap, as if it were missing something. Yet there was only the fog, only the grey. She was safe in the grey, it was like a blanket. Like strong, stone walls, the big machines couldn’t touch her, wouldn’t notice her. Here, she could rest. Yet still, Sister Melia was sure that she’d forgotten something… On the factorum floor, Augusta rolled back to her feet, bolter still in hand. The nasty stab of pain in her shoulder kept her head clear and sharp; she took in the scenario with a glance. Akemi and Caia were both getting up, but the falling doors had smashed Viola to the ground, and she wasn’t moving. A roll call in the vox did not get a response from the younger Sister. Around Viola’s still form were the city’s tumbled thugs. Some were getting up, dazed, others groaned in pain or did not move at all. Several more were still in the doorway, hiding in cover, their weapons aimed at the scene below. They did not fire. Corporal Mors was upright, Rufus with him; their lasrifles were aimed at the thugs, making them keep their heads down. Adriene was moving, but more slowly; Lucio stared sightless at the roof, his helmet tumbled off and his young face etched with a final expression of shock. By the angle, his neck was broken. The Sister Superior had a split-second to take all this in – then her line of light was blocked by something small, armoured, and lividly angry. Istrix stood in front of her, her face etched in bright scarlet and white, cross-hatched scars. A nimbus of hair had stood up from its braid – it had given her a halo, gleaming shock-white in the lumens. ‘I told you, I told you!’ Istrix’s words were a spittle-filled snarl. ‘I told you not to fire!’ Augusta inhaled, closing her teeth on a flare of livid and absolute fury. She recited her Oath of Ordination, striving for calm. Fides est armis meus mihi telum erudiens. My faith is my armour, my training my weapon. Smirking as if at some glorious, private joke, Zale lifted a hand to halt his various minions. The looming kastelans ground to a halt. Between them, the witch stood back with his arms folded, his attitude curious, and his confidence tangible – whoever won, this was still his game, and he was still in control. But the Sister Superior spared all of this barely a glance. There was a bolter-muzzle right in her face, a small, round void of death. Istrix’s words were vicious. ‘You are a traitor, Sister, just as much as he is. You have undermined my authority at every turn. You have refused my orders, taken initiatives to which you were not entitled. I am His word, His blade, and His law.’ She thundered the last sentence. ‘And I expect to be obeyed!’ Around them, the tableau had halted. Caia and Akemi flanked Augusta, weapons out, one to either shoulder; Viola, still, had not moved. Mors and Rufus were each dropped to one knee, covering the thugs, the kastelans and Zale himself. Adriene had joined them, though there was a trickle of scarlet down one side of her face. Nothing moved, nothing seemed to breathe. Everything held still, mesmerised by the confrontation between the tiny, furious inquisitor and the calm, steel-cold solidity of the veteran Sister. Augusta said, her tone pure steel, ‘I follow my mandate, guided by His wisdom.’ She pointed her bolter at Zale. ‘This witch must die.’ But Istrix was beyond hearing, beyond understanding. ‘Do you doubt my authority, Sister? My orders? Do you doubt His power? It is His voice I hear, His instructions I follow! He has brought us here! And He will tell me when to open fire!’ She trembled with intensity. ‘Heretics and betrayers, all of you! You are the denizens of Ruin! There is no faith! No loyalty! No trust! You are all fallen! All damned! I will kill you all! I will bring this whole planet to destruction with you still on it! You will blow to pieces like the moons–!’ ‘Then why don’t you?’ Zale spread his arms. His voice soft, he said, ‘Come on, my lovely. My Issy. My mistress. Do as He bids you. After all,’ and his smile was glorious, ‘you always have.’ Her eyes wild, Istrix was gripping the bolter in both hands now, her shaking increasing. There was a nerve-spasm ticking under her eye; her teeth were gritted. She looked like she was fighting something. Augusta said, ‘Shoot him, inquisitor. Or I will.’ The corporal’s voice interjected: ‘She won’t shoot him, Sister. She can’t.’ Augusta said, ‘What?’ ‘It’s the thing I couldn’t tell you,’ he said. He wasn’t looking at her; he still had his lasrifle trained on the thugs. ‘Why she shot the lieutenant.’ Realisation broke over Augusta like an ice-cold tide. In that second, even as the corporal spoke, the final question was answered, and she understood the thing she’d missed, right from the beginning… ‘He put it together,’ Mors said, ‘when he saw her cutting the scars into her own face. Zale’s been in her head all along – playing with her, torturing and tormenting her. She thinks she’s hearing the Emperor, doing His bidding. The lieutenant confronted her. And she shot him. Commanded the rest of us to say nothing, on our oath to Him.’ Oh, of course… It explained why Istrix had walked them straight into the initial ambush, why she’d specifically sought out Rayos, why she had persistently refused to let them open fire… Explained what – and why – the Militarum soldiers could not tell them. Zale had been playing with them all, all along – he’d probably let Mors see him at the smeltorium. So that he could lead them all here. Just like he’d lured Mors’ squad into a confrontation, and then murdered them… Just like the signal from the broken moons… Wrecker. Playing them, reeling them in. Too late, Augusta realised the wisdom of her own teachings: Everything has its Operandus. Zale had played his game expertly… And, if the Sisters were not strong enough to withstand him, he might even have won. The Sister Superior found that she, too, was shaking. Not from fear, but from the sheer brutality of the realisation, and from the rise of anger it brought with it… They had failed. Istrix had been weak, and she had faltered in her faith… And Augusta had not challenged her, despite knowing full well that she should have done. Perhaps the Penitence should be hers… But not until the witch was dead. ‘You betrayed us.’ Ice-calm, Augusta spoke to Istrix. ‘Led us into a trap. You have surrendered your soul, Istrix, your faith and your honour.’ Her squad continued to cover the witch; she turned her own bolter on the inquisitor. ‘You are a tool of Ruin, nothing more. You have turned your back upon Him, and opened your soul to the darkness.’ Istrix had bitten her lip. She was spitting blood and froth and outrage. ‘I have not failed! I will slay you all! You will feel His wrath! His strength! His light!’ ‘She’s mad,’ said Akemi softly, her tone awed. Augusta stepped forwards, placed her bolter beneath the woman’s chin, forcing her head back. ‘You are fallen, Istrix. Your life is forfeit. You–’ A weapon barked. The inquisitor collapsed. Augusta rocked on her heels, startled, but the shot had not been hers. It had not even been a bolter – it had been a single streak of heat, a sizzling hole bored clean through the side of the woman’s skull. Istrix lay on the floor, her mouth open, her scars pale. Smoke rose from her eye sockets. Blood pooled round her head like a corona. Carefully, the corporal raised his hands, but he did not release his rifle. Rufus and Adriene glanced at each other, then at the Sister Superior. They, too, raised their arms. But the group had a more immediate problem. Zale was swearing, savage and vicious and livid; his kastelans were moving again. ‘No! What have you done? What have you done?!’ And Augusta’s mind exploded. As the battle began, Sister Melia watched. She watched the kastelans as they lumbered into motion once more, felt the heavy stamping of their great feet. She heard the gangers chuckling, heard the continuous, monotone tick-ticking of Rayos’ heretek prayer. She was aware of the three red-armoured figures that stood against the remains of the city horde, and against the huge might of the looming machines. She watched it all as if through a mist, through a repeated blur of words that filled her head. You are nothing. You are abandoned. His light has left you. You cannot fulfil your role. You have made too many errors, Melia… In the fog in her head, there were thin lines of light – the lasrifles of the Militarum. There were shouts and orders; they spoke to something deep in her soul, some reflexive reaction. She found her hand in her lap twitching with more insistence, looking for something – an answer that the fog did not give her. And she could still see the glow – not its source, but the illumination that came from it, like something she’d lost. Something important. More words came through the grey – words like a blessing. A spiritu dominatus… Her twitching increased, her hand seemed to move towards her hip. There was more fighting, now. The great machines were moving more swiftly, feet stamping, fists slamming and grabbing. The three remaining soldiers were keeping the rabble back – shooting at the doorway above and battering those closest with the butts of their weapons. Two of the red figures stood against the kastelans; one still lay motionless, crushed beneath the doors… The other one stood still, swaying slightly as if it had lost the will to move. Even as Melia watched, it went over with a crash, face down. It made no attempt to put out its arms or to save itself. Its black and white cloak fluttered and was still. Augusta. The name came through the fog like the strike of a tutor’s ruler – it was the first thing that had made sense. The Sister Superior had fallen.",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE In thick, slow motion, Sister Melia watched everything. She was concealed beneath the shadow of a vast and silent hopper – she couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. She was not restrained, but a heavy fog of lassitude had soaked into her limbs and her thoughts. It had robbed her of any energy, and left her listless and dull. And there was something she’d forgotten, something… Something like a light, maybe, but just beyond her field of vision. She watched the balcony as it fell, watched the creaking, groaning metal as it collapsed to the floor. She saw the four scarlet-armoured figures as they fell with it. One rolled straight back to its feet, two others got up more slowly. The last one landed with a huge, metal door smashing down on top of it, edge-first. It did not move again. A flicker of concern went through Melia’s soul, but it soon faded, lost to the grey. Her distress was too nebulous, like trying to grip smoke – she understood that the red figures were important, but she couldn’t remember why. Domine, libra nos…? The words lingered, like some echo of her past. To either side of her, the two gangers were grinning, watching the fight like it was some sort of gang battle.

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN With no warning, the factorum was gone. Augusta was young, and wide-eyed, and in the grey robes of a novitiate. She was walking into the font-waters of her Ordination, but they were black and filthy, and the bodies of lost Sisters bobbed past her. On the far side, there waited a brand new set of armour, glistening like blood – her first. She’d trained for it, worked for it, and it was finally, really hers – yet she couldn’t reach it. The waters about her were covered in oil, and even as she struggled through their viscosity, her Sisters’ hymns about her congealed into a sour, minor key. The font burst into flame. The water burned, hot and raw, biting at her robed flesh. It was the flame of Lycheate’s pollution, of the Lautis daemon; it was the exultation of her combat-rage, and the darkness in her heart. It was glorious, and brutal. But, amidst the whirl and the heat and the pain, the Sister Superior clung on. In her head, the image from the chapel on the Kyrus – His face, stern and unforgiving. She could not perish, not like this – He would not permit her failure. Her anger – the thing with which Subul had tormented her, the thing she’d seen reflected in the daemon – that anger was her ally. And it was not darkness. It was good. Augusta’s hand was burned through to the bone, but still, she closed it on the grip of her bolter. She raised her voice, trying to sing the litany, coughing and tuneless in the midst of the smoking, suffocating heat: ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ As the Sister Superior fell, Melia’s thoughts spasmed with genuine fear. Around Augusta’s downed figure, the battle raged on. The kastelans were protecting Zale; one ground to a halt as a bolter took out its knee. It tried to take a further step and fell like a colossus, crushing friend and foe alike. One of the Militarum soldiers gave a final, awful scream. From somewhere beside her, Melia heard the strange tick-ticking intensify… Rayos. But the Sister’s head was clearing and the memories were coming back fast now, flooding the fog with new light – the shattered moons, the rust-brown planet, the crazed inquisitor. A spiritu dominatus Domine, libra nos. Only the litany… Only the lifeline… In her head, the fog was dissipating – stretching, thinning, fading. She shook herself, trying to clear her thoughts. The hand in her lap moved with more urgency. It was looking for a weapon. Jatoya’s flamer. Her flamer. Her flamer that she had earned, by virtue of her experience and wisdom; her flamer that she knew. Then she heard the ticking cease, heard Rayos say, ‘Sister Melia Kaliyan is seventy-eight point one per cent recovered. She will commence motion in two point two seconds.’ Startled, the gangers moved. But they were too late. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ From somewhere, the Sisters’ hymn was answering Augusta’s half-croaked words with the twinned sounds of prayer and gunfire. She heard the crash as the second kastelan went over, shaking the floor. And then, another voice – weak, but singing with them. Contralto. Familiar. Sister Viola, too damned stubborn to lose her life to anything as foolish as a fallen door. The surprise of it was like an influx of strength, like the music of a waterfall, putting out the flames. ‘I see you, Zale.’ She couldn’t see him – her eyes had melted in her skull. But she knew he was there, wrecker and manipulator, traitor and betrayer. Player of games. He had lured Istrix here, lured all of them here… For what? The thought was sharp, like a sudden hook of faith and clarity. Caught, her mind began to focus. All of this, was it just some impassioned connection between mistress and pupil? Or was it something more? Somewhere above her, the corporal slammed a final thug in the face with the butt of his rifle. He was shouting, and he was standing at an angle that was somehow all wrong. ‘Sister! Sister! Can you hear me? Sister!’ She was on the floor. ‘Sister!’ How…? Domine, libra nos. The flames had gone. She was herself, and unhurt – except for her broken shoulder. If Zale had been trying to control her, as he had controlled Istrix, he had failed. Her bolter was still in her grip. Slowly, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus got back to her feet. The two gangers were local toughs – heavy and filthy. They were decent enough as Lycheate enforcers, but they were no match for a fully-armoured member of the Adepta Sororitas. Melia downed one with a gauntlet to the face, brought the elbow sharply back to break the nose of the other. He stumbled, cursing and spitting, then tried for a grapple. But her other hand had drawn her flamer and she cracked him sharply on the head with the butt. He went down like a sack of rocks. ‘Ssss.’ Rayos had backed up, all her limbs mantling over her head. Her eyes – one red and one blue – were both fixed on Melia. Her mechadendrites rippled, tasting air and opportunity. There was a one hundred per cent chance that Melia was going to end her heretek existence. But there was data in the air, both prayer and plea; there were a hundred streams of information coming from somewhere beneath that oil-black cloak… What was down here? What was she trying to reach? Melia didn’t care. She pulled the trigger. Screaming in both human tongue and machine-code, the tech-priest became a torch. The city’s thugs were beaten, the kastelans ruined. Around Augusta, her Sisters were moving. Caia and Akemi were methodically executing the injured; Viola was shoving the door sideways with an angry curse – the red-haired Sister had not appreciated missing half the battle. Rufus had gone to help her. The corporal, the only other member of the squad surviving, had his lasrifle trained on the doorway above, though the last of the figures had gone. In the midst of destruction, Zale stood like an icon. He was losing his composure, now; he looked rattled and angry. Caia pulled the trigger on the final, protesting thug. It jerked, and was still. She turned to him, and said, ‘Where’s Melia?’ He replied, almost petulant, ‘You spoiled my game. All that work, everything I’ve planned and plotted – and she died!’ Suddenly, he was shouting, his fists clenched at his sides. ‘I needed her to see this! To see what I have done!’ ‘And what have you done, Zale?’ Augusta’s adrenaline was fading, now, and the pain in her shoulder was making her nauseous. ‘What is this wonder that you brought us all here to behold?’ ‘No.’ He stepped forwards, still the performer; despite his tight and twisted rage, he had an air of a man wanting to deliver a masterstroke. ‘I am still winning. I know how you think. I can tear you open, all of you. Do you know what a powerful psyker can do to a human mind? I can hollow you out like an egg. I can play upon your fears. I can conjure xenos, terrors from the warp, a hundred tortures to deliver pain to the cores of your souls. I can make you die, over and over again. I can make you fail. I can take your faith. I can give you despair, disaster and depression–’ ‘You’re as mad as your mistress,’ Augusta told him. ‘We are the servants of the God-Emperor,’ Caia said. ‘We can stand against your tricks, witch.’ ‘Can you?’ He rounded on the taller Sister. ‘I have already broken Sister Melia. She was weak, plagued by doubts. I know what you fear.’ Caia gave a single, piercing scream, a sharp, high sound that split the air like a siren. She crashed over sideways, her body wracked by spasms. Viola swore. The red-haired Sister was not yet on her feet, but she brought the heavy bolter up anyway. ‘I wouldn’t.’ Zale was trying to smile, but his expression had lost its elegance, and it was edged like a blade. ‘You want to know why I’m here?’ He laughed, brittle and crazed. ‘You think I just lured you, Sister Superior? I have Lycheate completely under my control. And I can lure all of them – every last member of the Inquisition can be called here, to their death! You think I just wanted revenge on Istrix?’ His laughter scaled upwards. ‘I will kill every one of them – every last one! – until they muster enough force to stop me.’ ‘That was what you wanted her to know,’ Augusta said. ‘That she had brought death upon her fellows. So that she would die, knowing exactly what she’d done.’ ‘She would have died in horror.’ Zale’s eyes shone like pyrite, the gold of a fool. ‘Knowing she was damned. Don’t try to stop me, Sister Augusta, or I will torture your entire squad, rip out their minds. Rayos will tear Melia to pieces.’ His grin spread. ‘And then we will rebuild her.’ ‘Try it,’ Augusta said, ‘and I will shoot every one of them myself.’ She raised her bolter. ‘Hold!’ The word came from a familiar, red-armoured figure, stepping from the shadows with her flamer in her hand. Augusta almost laughed; she raised her voice in a prayer like a celebration. But Sister Melia wasn’t finished. ‘Rayos is dead.’ Walking forwards, her helmet off, her flamer in hand, she had every bit as much presence as the witch. ‘Tear us open, will you? Hollow us out like eggs? Conjure monsters, xenos, a hundred tortures? You cannot make me die, witch, or lose my faith, or fail. And the only doubts are yours.’ ‘No!’ Zale was screaming now, rage and denial. ‘This can’t happen! You can’t–!’ There was a whoosh, and a flare. And the witch burned, just like Rayos had done. The factorum floor was covered in bodies. Sickened by the rich, thick smell of charred flesh, Augusta made sure that neither Melia nor Caia had been harmed, then she sent them to retrieve Rayos’ corpse. She wanted the heretek’s data – wanted to know what Rayos had been doing. What she’d found. What this ‘force’ really was that she had been assembling for Scafidis Zale. She put a round through the witch’s skull herself – just to make sure – and then turned to consider the fallen form of the inquisitor. Because, now that the mission was over, they had a very serious problem. ‘Corporal Mors.’ The corporal and Rufus had been paying what respects they could to their fallen comrades. At the order, Mors came to his feet and offered Augusta a salute. ‘Sister Superior.’ ‘I asked you in the lift, corporal,’ Augusta said, ‘how you came to be upon Lycheate.’ Her words were considered, thoughtful. Melia had set her shoulder and offered her a painkilling injection, and the Sister Superior had removed her helm. The young man watched her expression, his face tense. ‘But you did not have time to answer.’ It wasn’t a question, and Mors’ lifted his chin. She went on, ‘You have no insignia, corporal, none of you. No platoon, no company, no regiment. It has been scrubbed from your armour.’ ‘Sister, we–’ ‘You’re a good man, Mors.’ She turned from Istrix’s fallen form to look the young man in the face. ‘Your courage and swift thinking have been exceptional. But.’ Mors straightened his shoulders, held Augusta’s gaze. ‘You know the penalty for desertion.’ Rufus, crouched by the fallen Lucio, looked up sharply. ‘Yes, Sister. But…’ The corporal swallowed. ‘I request your permission to say one thing.’ ‘Granted.’ He looked at the body at their feet. Its eyes were glassy, and it was already starting to bloat. ‘I’m Astra Militarum, Sister – my individual life is worth nothing. And I’m a deserter, a coward and a traitor. But you… all of you… you’re Sororitas. I’ve heard stories about the Sisters of Battle – about how you halt entire wars with just your presence. About how the God-Emperor Himself gifted you the arts of combat.’ He offered a flicker of a smile. ‘About how you bite men’s heads from their shoulders–’ ‘Only when I’m really hungry,’ Augusta told him, straight-faced. The corporal blinked, almost laughed. Then he sobered, and said, ‘I pulled the trigger, Sister, so that you wouldn’t have to.’ Augusta eyed him thoughtfully. From anyone else, the words might have sounded like a lie, calculated to flatter, but she found that she believed him. ‘Sadly,’ she said, ‘I must still make answer for Istrix’s death. The responsibility is mine, whether I pulled the trigger or not.’ She watched him until he looked back up, met her gaze. ‘I believe you made the right choice, corporal. But the repercussions of this are out of my hands.’ Rufus had stood up, and had come to stand at Mors’ shoulder. Akemi said to him, ‘You still haven’t told us where you came from.’ ‘Tallus VII,’ Mors said. ‘We were left behind when our regi­ment pulled out. They didn’t come back for us, left us for the tyranids. But the Emperor blessed us – we escaped with the planet’s refugees, and that’s how we came here. I’d kind of hoped that, if we worked for Istrix, she would take us home.’ He shrugged, philosophical. ‘But now, I guess you’re going to execute us after all.’ Augusta tapped her boot. ‘I cannot take that decision,’ she said. ‘I must speak with my canoness, and upload a full and detailed report. And we must – all – face whatever comes in its wake.’ The thought was not a comfortable one. ‘Mors, is there somewhere we can secure an off-planet signal?’ Trying to hide his relief, the corporal said, ‘Back at the depot, Sister. Istrix’s shuttle is still there.’ ‘Good.’ She nodded. ‘We will return to the Kyrus, all of us, and await the canoness’ orders – and her punishment.’ The word was bitterly dark. ‘You will both be confined to quarters, and held under guard.’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Mors said. ‘Thank you.’ Augusta nodded, and turned as Caia and Melia came back to the factorum floor. They had weapons in their hands, and their expressions were concerned. ‘Tell me you found Rayos,’ Augusta said. ‘No, Sister,’ Caia told her. ‘We did not. We tracked her by the trail of blood and oil, but she must self-repair – it led only as far as the next hangar.’ Her tone was worried. ‘Sister, that hangar was full.’ ‘What?’ Melia said, ‘You know the old saying – the Mechanicus never delete anything?’ Augusta said, a statement of realisation, ‘There’s an army in there.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia said. ‘They all bear the mark of Incaladion, but they’re hundreds of years old. How the Mechanicus missed them, I cannot guess – but Rayos must have found them. Maybe the heretek Vius found them, on his original quest.’ ‘And they’re what Zale wanted,’ Augusta said. ‘An army of his own.’ Augusta shook her head, some part of her ­baffled by his and Istrix’s obsessive connection. ‘How strange, to be that consumed with another human.’ She dwelled on the oddity of it for a moment, then dismissed the whimsy. ‘We must assess this army.’ ‘We should destroy it,’ Viola muttered. ‘That is not our call to make,’ Augusta said. ‘While I have had enough of Lycheate’s filth, the presence of this force must be reported. We will speak to the canoness. This situation has become larger than we can face alone.’ ‘Sister?’ Melia asked her. ‘I suspect,’ Augusta said, ‘that the Mechanicus will request the data. They may come here themselves, and retrieve their forces.’ ‘And if they don’t?’ Akemi asked. ‘Then,’ the Sister Superior told her, ‘our situation may escalate. I suspect… if Rayos lives, our Order will call for war.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN With no warning, the factorum was gone. Augusta was young, and wide-eyed, and in the grey robes of a novitiate. She was walking into the font-waters of her Ordination, but they were black and filthy, and the bodies of lost Sisters bobbed past her. On the far side, there waited a brand new set of armour, glistening like blood – her first. She’d trained for it, worked for it, and it was finally, really hers – yet she couldn’t reach it. The waters about her were covered in oil, and even as she struggled through their viscosity, her Sisters’ hymns about her congealed into a sour, minor key. The font burst into flame. The water burned, hot and raw, biting at her robed flesh. It was the flame of Lycheate’s pollution, of the Lautis daemon; it was the exultation of her combat-rage, and the darkness in her heart. It was glorious, and brutal. But, amidst the whirl and the heat and the pain, the Sister Superior clung on. In her head, the image from the chapel on the Kyrus – His face, stern and unforgiving. She could not perish, not like this – He would not permit her failure. Her anger – the thing with which Subul had tormented her, the thing she’d seen reflected in the daemon – that anger was her ally. And it was not darkness. It was good. Augusta’s hand was burned through to the bone, but still, she closed it on the grip of her bolter. She raised her voice, trying to sing the litany, coughing and tuneless in the midst of the smoking, suffocating heat: ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ As the Sister Superior fell, Melia’s thoughts spasmed with genuine fear. Around Augusta’s downed figure, the battle raged on. The kastelans were protecting Zale; one ground to a halt as a bolter took out its knee. It tried to take a further step and fell like a colossus, crushing friend and foe alike. One of the Militarum soldiers gave a final, awful scream. From somewhere beside her, Melia heard the strange tick-ticking intensify… Rayos. But the Sister’s head was clearing and the memories were coming back fast now, flooding the fog with new light – the shattered moons, the rust-brown planet, the crazed inquisitor. A spiritu dominatus Domine, libra nos. Only the litany… Only the lifeline… In her head, the fog was dissipating – stretching, thinning, fading. She shook herself, trying to clear her thoughts. The hand in her lap moved with more urgency. It was looking for a weapon. Jatoya’s flamer. Her flamer. Her flamer that she had earned, by virtue of her experience and wisdom; her flamer that she knew. Then she heard the ticking cease, heard Rayos say, ‘Sister Melia Kaliyan is seventy-eight point one per cent recovered. She will commence motion in two point two seconds.’ Startled, the gangers moved. But they were too late. ‘Domine, libra nos!’ From somewhere, the Sisters’ hymn was answering Augusta’s half-croaked words with the twinned sounds of prayer and gunfire. She heard the crash as the second kastelan went over, shaking the floor. And then, another voice – weak, but singing with them. Contralto. Familiar. Sister Viola, too damned stubborn to lose her life to anything as foolish as a fallen door. The surprise of it was like an influx of strength, like the music of a waterfall, putting out the flames. ‘I see you, Zale.’ She couldn’t see him – her eyes had melted in her skull. But she knew he was there, wrecker and manipulator, traitor and betrayer. Player of games. He had lured Istrix here, lured all of them here… For what? The thought was sharp, like a sudden hook of faith and clarity. Caught, her mind began to focus. All of this, was it just some impassioned connection between mistress and pupil? Or was it something more? Somewhere above her, the corporal slammed a final thug in the face with the butt of his rifle. He was shouting, and he was standing at an angle that was somehow all wrong. ‘Sister! Sister! Can you hear me? Sister!’ She was on the floor. ‘Sister!’ How…? Domine, libra nos. The flames had gone. She was herself, and unhurt – except for her broken shoulder. If Zale had been trying to control her, as he had controlled Istrix, he had failed. Her bolter was still in her grip. Slowly, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus got back to her feet. The two gangers were local toughs – heavy and filthy. They were decent enough as Lycheate enforcers, but they were no match for a fully-armoured member of the Adepta Sororitas. Melia downed one with a gauntlet to the face, brought the elbow sharply back to break the nose of the other. He stumbled, cursing and spitting, then tried for a grapple. But her other hand had drawn her flamer and she cracked him sharply on the head with the butt. He went down like a sack of rocks. ‘Ssss.’ Rayos had backed up, all her limbs mantling over her head. Her eyes – one red and one blue – were both fixed on Melia. Her mechadendrites rippled, tasting air and opportunity. There was a one hundred per cent chance that Melia was going to end her heretek existence. But there was data in the air, both prayer and plea; there were a hundred streams of information coming from somewhere beneath that oil-black cloak… What was down here? What was she trying to reach? Melia didn’t care. She pulled the trigger. Screaming in both human tongue and machine-code, the tech-priest became a torch. The city’s thugs were beaten, the kastelans ruined. Around Augusta, her Sisters were moving. Caia and Akemi were methodically executing the injured; Viola was shoving the door sideways with an angry curse – the red-haired Sister had not appreciated missing half the battle. Rufus had gone to help her. The corporal, the only other member of the squad surviving, had his lasrifle trained on the doorway above, though the last of the figures had gone. In the midst of destruction, Zale stood like an icon. He was losing his composure, now; he looked rattled and angry. Caia pulled the trigger on the final, protesting thug. It jerked, and was still. She turned to him, and said, ‘Where’s Melia?’ He replied, almost petulant, ‘You spoiled my game. All that work, everything I’ve planned and plotted – and she died!’ Suddenly, he was shouting, his fists clenched at his sides. ‘I needed her to see this! To see what I have done!’ ‘And what have you done, Zale?’ Augusta’s adrenaline was fading, now, and the pain in her shoulder was making her nauseous. ‘What is this wonder that you brought us all here to behold?’ ‘No.’ He stepped forwards, still the performer; despite his tight and twisted rage, he had an air of a man wanting to deliver a masterstroke. ‘I am still winning. I know how you think. I can tear you open, all of you. Do you know what a powerful psyker can do to a human mind? I can hollow you out like an egg. I can play upon your fears. I can conjure xenos, terrors from the warp, a hundred tortures to deliver pain to the cores of your souls. I can make you die, over and over again. I can make you fail. I can take your faith. I can give you despair, disaster and depression–’ ‘You’re as mad as your mistress,’ Augusta told him. ‘We are the servants of the God-Emperor,’ Caia said. ‘We can stand against your tricks, witch.’ ‘Can you?’ He rounded on the taller Sister. ‘I have already broken Sister Melia. She was weak, plagued by doubts. I know what you fear.’ Caia gave a single, piercing scream, a sharp, high sound that split the air like a siren. She crashed over sideways, her body wracked by spasms. Viola swore. The red-haired Sister was not yet on her feet, but she brought the heavy bolter up anyway. ‘I wouldn’t.’ Zale was trying to smile, but his expression had lost its elegance, and it was edged like a blade. ‘You want to know why I’m here?’ He laughed, brittle and crazed. ‘You think I just lured you, Sister Superior? I have Lycheate completely under my control. And I can lure all of them – every last member of the Inquisition can be called here, to their death! You think I just wanted revenge on Istrix?’ His laughter scaled upwards. ‘I will kill every one of them – every last one! – until they muster enough force to stop me.’ ‘That was what you wanted her to know,’ Augusta said. ‘That she had brought death upon her fellows. So that she would die, knowing exactly what she’d done.’ ‘She would have died in horror.’ Zale’s eyes shone like pyrite, the gold of a fool. ‘Knowing she was damned. Don’t try to stop me, Sister Augusta, or I will torture your entire squad, rip out their minds. Rayos will tear Melia to pieces.’ His grin spread. ‘And then we will rebuild her.’ ‘Try it,’ Augusta said, ‘and I will shoot every one of them myself.’ She raised her bolter. ‘Hold!’ The word came from a familiar, red-armoured figure, stepping from the shadows with her flamer in her hand. Augusta almost laughed; she raised her voice in a prayer like a celebration. But Sister Melia wasn’t finished. ‘Rayos is dead.’ Walking forwards, her helmet off, her flamer in hand, she had every bit as much presence as the witch. ‘Tear us open, will you? Hollow us out like eggs? Conjure monsters, xenos, a hundred tortures? You cannot make me die, witch, or lose my faith, or fail. And the only doubts are yours.’ ‘No!’ Zale was screaming now, rage and denial. ‘This can’t happen! You can’t–!’ There was a whoosh, and a flare. And the witch burned, just like Rayos had done. The factorum floor was covered in bodies. Sickened by the rich, thick smell of charred flesh, Augusta made sure that neither Melia nor Caia had been harmed, then she sent them to retrieve Rayos’ corpse. She wanted the heretek’s data – wanted to know what Rayos had been doing. What she’d found. What this ‘force’ really was that she had been assembling for Scafidis Zale.

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE A lone red star, cold and swollen with age. A single satellite planet, ringed by a tumble of debris. In the limitless data-vaults of the Adeptus Mechanicus, it was designated Forge World Vastum-01 – a place of industry and production, of flexsteel and ferrocrete, of the sparking towers of forge temples and the smoothly flowing code of its living machinery. Its moons were reported as abundant with mines, its surface crawling with every kind of manufactorum. But Vastum was old. Finally stripped of its resources during the advance of the Iron Duke Glevan, it had been abandoned by its tech-priests centuries before. Their final act: to detonate the planet’s moons at their cores, and to claw free the last of that ore-rich rock. Vastum was a world dying, valueless and lost. But not – as yet – quite dead. A tiny figure under the filthy ochre sky, her oil-black cloak flowing like liquid, the heretek 05-Ray knew more about Vastum’s contemporary history than did the databanks of the long-absent Mechanicus. 05-Ray had come here as a questor, two decades before, seeking the dormant secrets of the planet’s technology, and she had found many things. To 05-Ray, this was not Vastum, abandoned and bereft of worth. To 05-Ray, this was Lycheate, and a wealth of waste. She knew it intimately. As the old red sun sank slowly into brown dust, she moved swiftly, the rusting steel causeway creaking beneath her claws. Her form was wary and alert, her array of augmetic limbs deployed and ready. She was two-point-zero-four miles from the nearest manufacturing platform here, and taking care to ensure her own safety. 05-Ray may have abandoned her people and her home world of Incaladion, yet the sleeping might of this production planet still coaxed from her a silent binary prayer. Her claw caught on a weld, and she paused. Fault designation three-point-zero-six. Servitor call enabled. ETA five solar minutes and seventeen seconds. She flicked through her files, closely analysing the structure of the metalwork below. Lycheate was a water world, built over by an endless fractal of elevated steel podia, the same efficient mathematical patterns repeated over and over again. But she was far from their solidity, out here, and the waters below her were polluted with centuries of effluvium. Chemical composition – N, NO3-N, NH4-N, S2-, SO42-, PO43-, COD, dissolved solids (TDS), heavy metals. They ate at the causeway’s supports, corroding the ancient metal. If it gave way, her weak and human flesh – what there was left of it – would not survive the immersion. Bodies floated past her, their skin eaten away. The fault in the weld, however, was not serious. The servitor sent back its confirmation, and 05-Ray was freed to continue her mission. The thought sent a spark through her nerve-clusters. Knowing what awaited her, her vestigial humanity shuddered with one of the few emotions she had remaining… Hope. Or possibly: Ambition. She looked up. Ahead of her, detectable by her human eye as a dark blur against the low umber clouds, her target rose into the sky. Her other eye extended from the steel side of her skull, its telescopic lens closing focus. Heading: ninety-four degrees south-south-west. Direct distance: one-point-eight-three miles. Actual distance: one-point-eight-five miles. Chances of interception: zero-point-zero-zero-one per cent. Lycheate’s watery surface was broken by occasional scatter­ings of semi-active volcanic islands – the only landfall offered by this lost, corroding world. The largest of these now lay before her: a headless cone of black rock, basalt and granite. It seemed featureless, rising harsh from the flat metallic stillness of the sea, yet 05-Ray knew what waited within. The holiest place on this battered world. Its designation: Vastum Forge Temple-01. Now almost empty. Gone were its tech-priests and enginseers, gone its worshippers and servitors. Its smoothly glittering black steps no longer felt feet or claws; its great columns and huge portico had long since been left to crumble. And purposeless spiked its endless, glinting vox-antennae… Well, not quite. 05-Ray sent the greeting-code that announced her arrival, and flitted like a data-ghost up the black ash beach. <01-Vius.> She waited for the response to her call. The old temple hung over her, huge and hollow, its ceiling riddled with stalactites, like fangs. Fear was a lost emotion to 05-Ray – only the faint memory-ghosts of childhood terrors – but still, this place made her human skin prickle, and interrupted the smooth flow of her data retrieval. The building was broken, cracked through to its core. Its central aisle was buckled, and its interior columns stood half-tumbled, sagging against each other like tired streaks of black severity. Scattered fragments of mica and obsidian glittered scarlet with the hunger of the lava-light below. But still, there lingered a presence here. <05-Ray.> The reply did not come through her ears, nor was it her name – that was a human thing, frail and foolish. Rather, it was the string of binary that she had earned for herself, the record of her skills and discoveries. It came to her in a data-stream, a pulse like recognition. <Your mission is successful.> <Affirm.> She uploaded the images readily – the planet’s multiple factoria, their assembled machines all standing in rows. When the Litany of Activation was finally broadcast, they would flow with new life. 01-Vius accepted and assessed everything – their numbers and positions, their deployments of weaponry. He ran the full tactical analysis: in the space of milliseconds, he had extrapolated every eventuality, and secured the most functional. <Assessment complete.> His outline came back to her – their deployment, their speeds and routes. Their muster point. <Chance of success. Eighty-nine-point-eight per cent,> 01-Vius told her, as she processed the progression of information. <It is acceptable. You will proceed.> She answered him with a query. There was a piece of data that he had omitted from his calculations, but it was one that had stayed with her, like a bullet fragment lodged in her human skin. At the upload, 01-Vius paused. The stream of his code halted as he considered the shifted parameters. Greatly daring, 05-Ray sent the query again. He did not respond. Instead, in the deepest darkness of the temple, something moved. Almost in spite of herself, 05-Ray backed up a step. She miscalculated the movements of her cloak and caught a claw on its hem, as clumsy as some newly augmented novice. The air around her was quiet now, emptier of information than the dead moons themselves. A shadow-fragment detached itself from the darkness at the head of the altar steps. Her telescopic twitched, but the analysis was redundant – she knew who this was. <Master.> Like her, he wore an oil-black cloak. Like her, he still carried the cog-and-skull of Incaladion – though upon 01-Vius, that mark was embossed in the pitted flexsteel of his face. Unlike her, he had never defaced that mark. It waited like a promise. Air wheezed through the bellows in his chest, his jaw moved as he tested the cogs and cables of his vocal array. He was older than she, far older, and he reflected the rust and corrosion of Lycheate itself, almost like he had become a part of the planet’s machine-soul. 05-Ray wondered how long it had been since he had spoken aloud. He said, ‘Sororitas.’ The word had no accompanying data – it hissed through the lava-glow of the temple like a threat. ‘Correct.’ Her response, too, was aloud, though she spoke more easily. 05-Ray still had business with normal humans, and she better remembered this ungainly, ineffectual communication. They’d even had their own name for her – they’d called her ‘Rayos’. 01-Vius forced the air out of his chest. It was a moment before she understood that he was laughing. She who had no fear – it chilled her to the core. ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said, the words grinding like rust. ‘And in numbers.’ She knew that he was calculating those numbers, running battle plans and assessing consequences, but he did not offer her the new data. She waited. Slowly, 01-Vius creaked down the stairs, his great shoulders hunched, his joints grinding. Beneath his cloak, his metal chest was scarred with rust and old wounds, and his multiple limbs were held folded, almost as if, like his voice, he no longer had need of them. He came to stand before her, towering over her smaller form. The temple’s close heat radiated from his body. Upon 01-Vius, there was no flesh remaining. The word was out before she could stop it, ‘Master?’ ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said again. Holo-images flickered in the lava-light – red armour and righteous wrath, the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. 05-Ray said, ‘Affirm.’ Again, that amused exhalation. Yet there was still no upload, and the info-vacuum was loud as a shout. ‘Let them,’ 01-Vius said. ‘My force is assembled. My data is correct. My extrapolations are without error. If they come, then they will die.’ The huge sun sank, its sullen light fading to a low glare. An old doorway ground open against a layer of metallic dust. An expanding arc of illumination swelled across a silent floor. Within it, a red boot came down, ceramite ringing on stone. It was followed by a second, both caked with the filth of Lycheate’s rusting evening; a black-and-white cloak fluttered above them, its hem newly repaired. Sister Superior Augusta Santorus closed the heavy door behind her and stood silent, looking up a long, central aisle towards a set of unfamiliar steps. A twenty-year veteran of the Adepta Sororitas, Augusta had spent her life in the chapels and cathedrals of the God-Emperor of Mankind, her head bared in humility, her weapons laid aside. Yet this place felt… Strange. Ahead of her, the aisle was lit by huge metal bowls, electro-furnaces, a series of them marching up either side of a black stone path. They warmed the air, and they lit the walls and pipes to a brassy, hellish glare. At the aisle’s far end, the steps led up, not to a chancel or altar, but to an intricate seethe of forgeworks, their twists and angles now glinting with the life of the flames. At their centre, their holy symbol was still visible: a half-human, half-augmented skull, surrounded by its square-toothed cog. The symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and of the Omnissiah. Behind it, where the great glassaic window should have been, there hung a long banner, black and red and white – the mark of Augusta’s Order, the Bloody Rose. It had been raised by their canoness, Elvorix Ianthe, with a powerful service of hymns and prayers, and it had appropriated this ancient building to a whole new purpose… This was no longer a forge temple. This was a muster point. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. The Litany for Divine Guidance in her heart, Augusta reflexively looked for the servitor – for its borne trays upon which to lay her weapons – but there would be no such demand, not here. Her bolter and chainsword still at her hips, she walked up the aisle. ‘Sister Superior.’ She had taken barely six steps before there was a figure at her side, a young woman in scarlet armour that still squeaked with newness. Her helm was off, revealing a smoothly tanned face of barely twenty years, its fleur-de-lys tattoo still sharp. ‘I’m Kirah, Sister,’ she said. ‘The canoness is expecting you. Please, follow me.’ Augusta did as she was asked, following the younger Sister as she ducked between the furnaces, and out towards a narrow split in the pipes. There were no novices to attend the canoness’ orders, and Kirah must be running her messages… And her summons. Not showing her tension, the Sister Superior continued to pray. Levis est mihi… Show me to the light. She had been waiting almost two weeks for this audience, cooling her heels in her squad’s temporary dormitorium – and she knew full well that the wait had been deliberate. That the canoness was making her think about the consequences of her previous mission. And Augusta understood its severity. There was every possibility that she would be stripped of her rank, her merits, her armour, and that she would find herself with the slavering fervour and eviscerator blade of the Sisters Repentia… The thought sent a shudder up her spine. But it was no more than she deserved. As they approached the split, Sister Kirah glanced back over her shoulder. ‘Just a reminder, Sister, that we’re unable to use the vox until the full security procedure is completed. This is a heretek planet, its spirits unknown to us, and we cannot be sure that our information is… untainted. For now, please only use the vox in an emergency, and use only channel epsilon.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. She wondered if the words were a warning – telling her not to speak to her squad until she had been given permission. The implied lack of trust made her shiver of tension worse, but she kept her chin lifted and her shoulders square. Whatever the canoness’ judgement, she would face it like a warrior. ‘In here, Sister.’ The young woman stopped at the gap, and gestured for the Sister Superior to move ahead. Steadying herself to stern discipline, Augusta stepped through the doorway. And stopped. The gap opened onto a small balcony, and a set of narrow steel steps leading around and down into a perfectly circular pit. The walls were one huge data-loom, a great ring of banks and wires and platforms, all now sleeping and covered with dust – but they were not what caught the Sister Superior’s attention. In the middle of the floor, there was a hololith projector, currently showing the planet itself, turning slow and semi-transparent in the centre of the room. It was surrounded by red-armoured figures, every one of them bareheaded and heavily armed – Augusta knew many of them from the Convent Sanctorum, or from previous missions. The taciturn, dark-skinned Seraphim commander, Sister Nikaya. Eleni and Roku, Sisters Superior, both veterans like herself. The single unarmoured figure, grey-haired and stoop-shouldered – Rhene, the ageing Hospitaller. There were other figures that she did not know, but there was a glint of adamantine to every chaplet, a zealous flare to every gaze. To the last woman, every one of them had stopped and looked up. The holo-planet winked out; the silence was heavy as judgement. Augusta paused, still praying. For truth, for strength. For justice, in whatever manner He may decree. Then she followed the metal stairway, around and down, and into the room. In the silence, her bootsteps clanged like bells. ‘Dismissed,’ came the canoness’ voice, clipped and commanding. ‘All except you two.’ She pointed at two of the unfamiliar figures, who stopped where they were. ‘The rest of you, the briefing will continue after Terce.’ ‘Milady.’ Retrieving electro-quills and dataslates, the Order’s senior Sisters retreated from the room. Once they had gone, the tall, ice-haired figure of the canoness emerged from behind the hololith table and stood waiting, her arms folded, her feet apart, her red armour looking almost bloodstained in the light. Her lined face was aged, but it showed no compromise; her tattoo, though blurred to blue, rested upon an expression of cold calm. Elvorix Ianthe was a stern disciplinarian, and a warrior without peer. Augusta felt her heart contract, already knowing the fate that awaited her. Before the Emperor I have sinned. Beyond forgiveness. Beyond forbearance. Beyond mercy… But she reached the bottom of the steps, and saluted. ‘Your eminence.’ ‘Sister Superior,’ Ianthe said, her tone acid. ‘Once again, you complete your mission, and you leave me with a headache.’ The word was a ruler-slap, a strike like pure discipline. Augusta caught her breath, but said nothing. She stared straight ahead, her eyes fixed on the data-loom of the far wall. ‘Your orders were very simple, Sister – to locate and slay the witch, and to obey the mission’s commander.’ Ianthe’s voice was biting, absolutely merciless. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. ‘And the mission’s commander. Was shot dead. While under your protection.’ Each phrase was clearly enunciated, hitting like a fist. ‘Yes, milady.’ Her pulse pounding, the Sister Superior did not flinch. She did not dare. ‘That fact alone would necessitate a significant reprimand.’ Ianthe paused, studying Augusta’s stone-steady expression. ‘But the commander of your mission was a member of the Emperor’s Inquisition.’ Like an irate parade-ground sergeant, she leaned in close to deliver the final word. Her chin up, her blood thundering, Augusta continued to stare straight ahead. A hundred explanations crowded to the front of her thoughts, but she would not speak until permitted. And the canoness already knew the full story – Augusta’s report had been both detailed and thorough. Stepping back, Ianthe let out her breath, apparently considering her next words. ‘Sister Superior. You have given your sworn oath, by the blade of Saint Mina and by the God-Emperor Himself, that Inquisitor Istrix had fallen to the Ruinous Powers. Do you stand by this oath?’ ‘As He is my witness, I stand by my oath.’ Augusta’s voice was flat, her words certain. ‘The witch, Scafidis Zale, had been the inquisitor’s interrogator and he had… charmed… his way into her thoughts. While she did not know it, Istrix had herself fallen to heresy. Corporal Mors shot her to save my life.’ ‘From your report, Sister,’ the canoness said, ‘he shot her to save your reputation.’ ‘That is also true,’ she said. ‘As Astra Militarum, he considered himself expendable.’ She recalled Mors’ words – But you… you’re Sororitas – and continued, ‘Corporal Mors is a good man, milady, honourable and courageous. Truly, he serves the Emperor.’ ‘Mors,’ the omission of the ex-soldier’s rank was both pointed and deliberate, ‘is a deserter. His life is forfeit. Why did you not just shoot him?’ The words were like a rope, lowering about her throat. Carefully, she answered, ‘He was under Istrix’s command, milady–’ ‘He was under Istrix’s command.’ The canoness repeated her words; let them hang in the air like the raised whip of the Repentia mistress. Still, Augusta did not flinch. Ianthe watched her, then, slowly, nodded at her discipline. ‘And that single fact, Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has secured your rank, your armour, your merits, and your continued service to this Order.’ Service…! At the word, the Sister Superior’s belly turned over, her knees went to water. She, who had faced twenty years of combat, faced witch and xenos and heretic, faced a greater daemon on her own two feet… she found herself shaking with the shock of her reprieve. Our Emperor, deliver us! She wanted to sing her thanks aloud, but she held herself still. ‘I will make sure,’ and the canoness’ smile was grim, ‘to pass your gratitude to the prioress.’ The word was a warning – perhaps indicating just how close Augusta had really come to that eviscerator blade. Sternly controlling her tone, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Which,’ the canoness went on, ‘brings me, rather neatly, to her orders.’ The Sister Superior blinked. ‘Milady?’ ‘Your squad is under-strength, Sister,’ Ianthe said. She indicated the two women who had remained in the room, one tall, slim and golden-haired, the other heavily built and square-jawed. ‘This is Sister Rhea, and Sister Alcina. They will be joining you for the remainder of this mission. Due to her seniority and length of service, Sister Alcina,’ – the square-jawed woman gave Augusta a curt nod – ‘will be replacing Sister Melia as your second-in-command.’ ‘Permission to–’ ‘Denied.’ The canoness cut across her question. ‘Since my adjutant remained upon Ophelia VII, Sister Caia de Musa will be serving me in that role. Both these Sisters will be joining your squad.’ The grim smile faded. ‘And I strongly suggest that you don’t make any further mistakes.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER ONE A lone red star, cold and swollen with age. A single satellite planet, ringed by a tumble of debris. In the limitless data-vaults of the Adeptus Mechanicus, it was designated Forge World Vastum-01 – a place of industry and production, of flexsteel and ferrocrete, of the sparking towers of forge temples and the smoothly flowing code of its living machinery. Its moons were reported as abundant with mines, its surface crawling with every kind of manufactorum. But Vastum was old. Finally stripped of its resources during the advance of the Iron Duke Glevan, it had been abandoned by its tech-priests centuries before. Their final act: to detonate the planet’s moons at their cores, and to claw free the last of that ore-rich rock. Vastum was a world dying, valueless and lost. But not – as yet – quite dead. A tiny figure under the filthy ochre sky, her oil-black cloak flowing like liquid, the heretek 05-Ray knew more about Vastum’s contemporary history than did the databanks of the long-absent Mechanicus. 05-Ray had come here as a questor, two decades before, seeking the dormant secrets of the planet’s technology, and she had found many things. To 05-Ray, this was not Vastum, abandoned and bereft of worth. To 05-Ray, this was Lycheate, and a wealth of waste. She knew it intimately. As the old red sun sank slowly into brown dust, she moved swiftly, the rusting steel causeway creaking beneath her claws. Her form was wary and alert, her array of augmetic limbs deployed and ready. She was two-point-zero-four miles from the nearest manufacturing platform here, and taking care to ensure her own safety. 05-Ray may have abandoned her people and her home world of Incaladion, yet the sleeping might of this production planet still coaxed from her a silent binary prayer. Her claw caught on a weld, and she paused. Fault designation three-point-zero-six. Servitor call enabled. ETA five solar minutes and seventeen seconds. She flicked through her files, closely analysing the structure of the metalwork below. Lycheate was a water world, built over by an endless fractal of elevated steel podia, the same efficient mathematical patterns repeated over and over again. But she was far from their solidity, out here, and the waters below her were polluted with centuries of effluvium. Chemical composition – N, NO3-N, NH4-N, S2-, SO42-, PO43-, COD, dissolved solids (TDS), heavy metals. They ate at the causeway’s supports, corroding the ancient metal. If it gave way, her weak and human flesh – what there was left of it – would not survive the immersion. Bodies floated past her, their skin eaten away. The fault in the weld, however, was not serious. The servitor sent back its confirmation, and 05-Ray was freed to continue her mission. The thought sent a spark through her nerve-clusters. Knowing what awaited her, her vestigial humanity shuddered with one of the few emotions she had remaining… Hope. Or possibly: Ambition. She looked up. Ahead of her, detectable by her human eye as a dark blur against the low umber clouds, her target rose into the sky. Her other eye extended from the steel side of her skull, its telescopic lens closing focus. Heading: ninety-four degrees south-south-west. Direct distance: one-point-eight-three miles. Actual distance: one-point-eight-five miles. Chances of interception: zero-point-zero-zero-one per cent. Lycheate’s watery surface was broken by occasional scatter­ings of semi-active volcanic islands – the only landfall offered by this lost, corroding world. The largest of these now lay before her: a headless cone of black rock, basalt and granite. It seemed featureless, rising harsh from the flat metallic stillness of the sea, yet 05-Ray knew what waited within. The holiest place on this battered world. Its designation: Vastum Forge Temple-01. Now almost empty. Gone were its tech-priests and enginseers, gone its worshippers and servitors. Its smoothly glittering black steps no longer felt feet or claws; its great columns and huge portico had long since been left to crumble. And purposeless spiked its endless, glinting vox-antennae… Well, not quite. 05-Ray sent the greeting-code that announced her arrival, and flitted like a data-ghost up the black ash beach. <01-Vius.> She waited for the response to her call. The old temple hung over her, huge and hollow, its ceiling riddled with stalactites, like fangs. Fear was a lost emotion to 05-Ray – only the faint memory-ghosts of childhood terrors – but still, this place made her human skin prickle, and interrupted the smooth flow of her data retrieval. The building was broken, cracked through to its core. Its central aisle was buckled, and its interior columns stood half-tumbled, sagging against each other like tired streaks of black severity. Scattered fragments of mica and obsidian glittered scarlet with the hunger of the lava-light below. But still, there lingered a presence here. <05-Ray.> The reply did not come through her ears, nor was it her name – that was a human thing, frail and foolish. Rather, it was the string of binary that she had earned for herself, the record of her skills and discoveries. It came to her in a data-stream, a pulse like recognition. <Your mission is successful.> <Affirm.> She uploaded the images readily – the planet’s multiple factoria, their assembled machines all standing in rows. When the Litany of Activation was finally broadcast, they would flow with new life. 01-Vius accepted and assessed everything – their numbers and positions, their deployments of weaponry. He ran the full tactical analysis: in the space of milliseconds, he had extrapolated every eventuality, and secured the most functional. <Assessment complete.> His outline came back to her – their deployment, their speeds and routes. Their muster point. <Chance of success. Eighty-nine-point-eight per cent,> 01-Vius told her, as she processed the progression of information. <It is acceptable. You will proceed.> She answered him with a query. There was a piece of data that he had omitted from his calculations, but it was one that had stayed with her, like a bullet fragment lodged in her human skin. At the upload, 01-Vius paused. The stream of his code halted as he considered the shifted parameters. Greatly daring, 05-Ray sent the query again. He did not respond. Instead, in the deepest darkness of the temple, something moved. Almost in spite of herself, 05-Ray backed up a step. She miscalculated the movements of her cloak and caught a claw on its hem, as clumsy as some newly augmented novice. The air around her was quiet now, emptier of information than the dead moons themselves. A shadow-fragment detached itself from the darkness at the head of the altar steps. Her telescopic twitched, but the analysis was redundant – she knew who this was. <Master.> Like her, he wore an oil-black cloak. Like her, he still carried the cog-and-skull of Incaladion – though upon 01-Vius, that mark was embossed in the pitted flexsteel of his face. Unlike her, he had never defaced that mark. It waited like a promise. Air wheezed through the bellows in his chest, his jaw moved as he tested the cogs and cables of his vocal array. He was older than she, far older, and he reflected the rust and corrosion of Lycheate itself, almost like he had become a part of the planet’s machine-soul. 05-Ray wondered how long it had been since he had spoken aloud. He said, ‘Sororitas.’ The word had no accompanying data – it hissed through the lava-glow of the temple like a threat. ‘Correct.’ Her response, too, was aloud, though she spoke more easily. 05-Ray still had business with normal humans, and she better remembered this ungainly, ineffectual communication. They’d even had their own name for her – they’d called her ‘Rayos’. 01-Vius forced the air out of his chest. It was a moment before she understood that he was laughing. She who had no fear – it chilled her to the core. ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said, the words grinding like rust. ‘And in numbers.’ She knew that he was calculating those numbers, running battle plans and assessing consequences, but he did not offer her the new data. She waited. Slowly, 01-Vius creaked down the stairs, his great shoulders hunched, his joints grinding. Beneath his cloak, his metal chest was scarred with rust and old wounds, and his multiple limbs were held folded, almost as if, like his voice, he no longer had need of them. He came to stand before her, towering over her smaller form. The temple’s close heat radiated from his body. Upon 01-Vius, there was no flesh remaining. The word was out before she could stop it, ‘Master?’ ‘The Sisters of Battle will come,’ he said again. Holo-images flickered in the lava-light – red armour and righteous wrath, the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. 05-Ray said, ‘Affirm.’ Again, that amused exhalation. Yet there was still no upload, and the info-vacuum was loud as a shout. ‘Let them,’ 01-Vius said. ‘My force is assembled. My data is correct. My extrapolations are without error. If they come, then they will die.’ The huge sun sank, its sullen light fading to a low glare. An old doorway ground open against a layer of metallic dust. An expanding arc of illumination swelled across a silent floor. Within it, a red boot came down, ceramite ringing on stone. It was followed by a second, both caked with the filth of Lycheate’s rusting evening; a black-and-white cloak fluttered above them, its hem newly repaired. Sister Superior Augusta Santorus closed the heavy door behind her and stood silent, looking up a long, central aisle towards a set of unfamiliar steps. A twenty-year veteran of the Adepta Sororitas, Augusta had spent her life in the chapels and cathedrals of the God-Emperor of Mankind, her head bared in humility, her weapons laid aside. Yet this place felt… Strange. Ahead of her, the aisle was lit by huge metal bowls, electro-furnaces, a series of them marching up either side of a black stone path. They warmed the air, and they lit the walls and pipes to a brassy, hellish glare. At the aisle’s far end, the steps led up, not to a chancel or altar, but to an intricate seethe of forgeworks, their twists and angles now glinting with the life of the flames. At their centre, their holy symbol was still visible: a half-human, half-augmented skull, surrounded by its square-toothed cog. The symbol of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and of the Omnissiah. Behind it, where the great glassaic window should have been, there hung a long banner, black and red and white – the mark of Augusta’s Order, the Bloody Rose. It had been raised by their canoness, Elvorix Ianthe, with a powerful service of hymns and prayers, and it had appropriated this ancient building to a whole new purpose… This was no longer a forge temple. This was a muster point. Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris. Guide me, my Emperor. The Litany for Divine Guidance in her heart, Augusta reflexively looked for the servitor – for its borne trays upon which to lay her weapons – but there would be no such demand, not here. Her bolter and chainsword still at her hips, she walked up the aisle. ‘Sister Superior.’ She had taken barely six steps before there was a figure at her side, a young woman in scarlet armour that still squeaked with newness. Her helm was off, revealing a smoothly tanned face of barely twenty years, its fleur-de-lys tattoo still sharp. ‘I’m Kirah, Sister,’ she said. ‘The canoness is expecting you. Please, follow me.’ Augusta did as she was asked, following the younger Sister as she ducked between the furnaces, and out towards a narrow split in the pipes. There were no novices to attend the canoness’ orders, and Kirah must be running her messages… And her summons. Not showing her tension, the Sister Superior continued to pray. Levis est mihi… Show me to the light. She had been waiting almost two weeks for this audience, cooling her heels in her squad’s temporary dormitorium – and she knew full well that the wait had been deliberate. That the canoness was making her think about the consequences of her previous mission. And Augusta understood its severity. There was every possibility that she would be stripped of her rank, her merits, her armour, and that she would find herself with the slavering fervour and eviscerator blade of the Sisters Repentia… The thought sent a shudder up her spine. But it was no more than she deserved. As they approached the split, Sister Kirah glanced back over her shoulder. ‘Just a reminder, Sister, that we’re unable to use the vox until the full security procedure is completed. This is a heretek planet, its spirits unknown to us, and we cannot be sure that our information is… untainted. For now, please only use the vox in an emergency, and use only channel epsilon.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. She wondered if the words were a warning – telling her not to speak to her squad until she had been given permission. The implied lack of trust made her shiver of tension worse, but she kept her chin lifted and her shoulders square. Whatever the canoness’ judgement, she would face it like a warrior. ‘In here, Sister.’ The young woman stopped at the gap, and gestured for the Sister Superior to move ahead. Steadying herself to stern discipline, Augusta stepped through the doorway. And stopped. The gap opened onto a small balcony, and a set of narrow steel steps leading around and down into a perfectly circular pit. The walls were one huge data-loom, a great ring of banks and wires and platforms, all now sleeping and covered with dust – but they were not what caught the Sister Superior’s attention. In the middle of the floor, there was a hololith projector, currently showing the planet itself, turning slow and semi-transparent in the centre of the room. It was surrounded by red-armoured figures, every one of them bareheaded and heavily armed – Augusta knew many of them from the Convent Sanctorum, or from previous missions. The taciturn, dark-skinned Seraphim commander, Sister Nikaya. Eleni and Roku, Sisters Superior, both veterans like herself. The single unarmoured figure, grey-haired and stoop-shouldered – Rhene, the ageing Hospitaller. There were other figures that she did not know, but there was a glint of adamantine to every chaplet, a zealous flare to every gaze. To the last woman, every one of them had stopped and looked up. The holo-planet winked out; the silence was heavy as judgement. Augusta paused, still praying. For truth, for strength. For justice, in whatever manner He may decree. Then she followed the metal stairway, around and down, and into the room. In the silence, her bootsteps clanged like bells. ‘Dismissed,’ came the canoness’ voice, clipped and commanding. ‘All except you two.’ She pointed at two of the unfamiliar figures, who stopped where they were. ‘The rest of you, the briefing will continue after Terce.’ ‘Milady.’ Retrieving electro-quills and dataslates, the Order’s senior Sisters retreated from the room. Once they had gone, the tall, ice-haired figure of the canoness emerged from behind the hololith table and stood waiting, her arms folded, her feet apart, her red armour looking almost bloodstained in the light. Her lined face was aged, but it showed no compromise; her tattoo, though blurred to blue, rested upon an expression of cold calm. Elvorix Ianthe was a stern disciplinarian, and a warrior without peer. Augusta felt her heart contract, already knowing the fate that awaited her. Before the Emperor I have sinned. Beyond forgiveness. Beyond forbearance. Beyond mercy… But she reached the bottom of the steps, and saluted. ‘Your eminence.’ ‘Sister Superior,’ Ianthe said, her tone acid. ‘Once again, you complete your mission, and you leave me with a headache.’ The word was a ruler-slap, a strike like pure discipline. Augusta caught her breath, but said nothing. She stared straight ahead, her eyes fixed on the data-loom of the far wall. ‘Your orders were very simple, Sister – to locate and slay the witch, and to obey the mission’s commander.’ Ianthe’s voice was biting, absolutely merciless. ‘Yes, milady.’ Ianthe flexed on her toes, her armour creaking. ‘And the mission’s commander. Was shot dead. While under your protection.’ Each phrase was clearly enunciated, hitting like a fist. ‘Yes, milady.’ Her pulse pounding, the Sister Superior did not flinch. She did not dare. ‘That fact alone would necessitate a significant reprimand.’ Ianthe paused, studying Augusta’s stone-steady expression. ‘But the commander of your mission was a member of the Emperor’s Inquisition.’ Like an irate parade-ground sergeant, she leaned in close to deliver the final word. Her chin up, her blood thundering, Augusta continued to stare straight ahead. A hundred explanations crowded to the front of her thoughts, but she would not speak until permitted. And the canoness already knew the full story – Augusta’s report had been both detailed and thorough. Stepping back, Ianthe let out her breath, apparently considering her next words. ‘Sister Superior. You have given your sworn oath, by the blade of Saint Mina and by the God-Emperor Himself, that Inquisitor Istrix had fallen to the Ruinous Powers. Do you stand by this oath?’ ‘As He is my witness, I stand by my oath.’ Augusta’s voice was flat, her words certain. ‘The witch, Scafidis Zale, had been the inquisitor’s interrogator and he had… charmed… his way into her thoughts. While she did not know it, Istrix had herself fallen to heresy. Corporal Mors shot her to save my life.’ ‘From your report, Sister,’ the canoness said, ‘he shot her to save your reputation.’ ‘That is also true,’ she said. ‘As Astra Militarum, he considered himself expendable.’ She recalled Mors’ words – But you… you’re Sororitas – and continued, ‘Corporal Mors is a good man, milady, honourable and courageous. Truly, he serves the Emperor.’ ‘Mors,’ the omission of the ex-soldier’s rank was both pointed and deliberate, ‘is a deserter. His life is forfeit. Why did you not just shoot him?’ The words were like a rope, lowering about her throat. Carefully, she answered, ‘He was under Istrix’s command, milady–’ ‘He was under Istrix’s command.’ The canoness repeated her words; let them hang in the air like the raised whip of the Repentia mistress. Still, Augusta did not flinch. Ianthe watched her, then, slowly, nodded at her discipline. ‘And that single fact, Sister Superior,’ she said, ‘has secured your rank, your armour, your merits, and your continued service to this Order.’ Service…! At the word, the Sister Superior’s belly turned over, her knees went to water. She, who had faced twenty years of combat, faced witch and xenos and heretic, faced a greater daemon on her own two feet… she found herself shaking with the shock of her reprieve. Our Emperor, deliver us! She wanted to sing her thanks aloud, but she held herself still. ‘I will make sure,’ and the canoness’ smile was grim, ‘to pass your gratitude to the prioress.’ The word was a warning – perhaps indicating just how close Augusta had really come to that eviscerator blade. Sternly controlling her tone, Augusta said, ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Which,’ the canoness went on, ‘brings me, rather neatly, to her orders.’ The Sister Superior blinked. ‘Milady?’ ‘Your squad is under-strength, Sister,’ Ianthe said. She indicated the two women who had remained in the room, one tall, slim and golden-haired, the other heavily built and square-jawed. ‘This is Sister Rhea, and Sister Alcina. They will be joining you for the remainder of this mission. Due to her seniority and length of service, Sister Alcina,’ – the square-jawed woman gave Augusta a curt nod – ‘will be replacing Sister Melia as your second-in-command.’ ‘Permission to–’ ‘Denied.’ The canoness cut across her question. ‘Since my adjutant remained upon Ophelia VII, Sister Caia de Musa will be serving me in that role. Both these Sisters will be joining your squad.’ The grim smile faded. ‘And I strongly suggest that you don’t make any further mistakes.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER TWO In the Solidarities of Saint Mina, it is written that the God-Emperor sees all. That He walks with every Sister as she carries His name into the void, that He hears the words of every hymn, the thunder of every weapon, the battle cry of every warrior. It is also written that wherever forces are gathered in His name, there He shall be. ‘Ubi autem ambulat, ibi non potest esse deficiendi.’ Wherever He walks, there can be no failure. After the canoness’ briefing, Sister Augusta returned to her squad in their makeshift dormitorium – an abandoned hopper-trench now warmed by the richly decorated rose banners of their Order. Pipes and conduits wove their way down a long, half-cylindrical ceiling and, at the far end, an altar now stood to His might and presence. Standing before it, the Sisters recited, softly and together: ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none, We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to a close, the newly reformed squad stood in silence, heads bowed and armour gleaming. Electro-candles glinted from their scarlet armour and from the weave of wires through the walls. Augusta looked at each of them. Like her, her Sisters had been kept waiting while the canoness had decided their fate, and now she could feel their nervousness, like a tightly pulled wire. She looked down their line, from face to face. Sister Melia Kaliyan, dusky and dark-eyed and, until the canoness’ recent orders, the squad’s second-in-command. The implication of her replacement was all too clear – the witch, Scafidis Zale, had touched Melia’s mind and her trustworthiness could be compromised. Augusta trusted her Sisters completely, but the insinuation was making her flesh creep – like the nightmares left by the daemon, the witch’s mental trickery was too recent, and they needed to be wary of its residue. Next to Melia, Sister Viola Taenaris, red-haired and freckle-skinned. In her gauntleted hands she bore the exquisitely decorated, thrice-blessed heavy bolter that, here, she carried at all times. Viola was still young, and she could be both undisciplined and unpredictable, but her courage was truly ferocious. By Viola, Sister Akemi Hirari, with her black hair and pale skin and her dataslate already in her hand. Though the youngest of the squad, Akemi’s insight and education were unparalleled, and often she understood things that the others did not. Beyond them, at the far end of the line, stood the newcomer Sister Rhea, tall and elegant, her blue eyes downcast. Rhea was young enough for her tattoo to be crisp, but experienced enough to already carry three merit beads on her chaplet. She bore her auspex close to hand, as Sister Caia had always done. And behind them all stood the big, heavy-shouldered form of Sister Alcina, her arms crossed and her chaplet heavy with adamantine. She, too, was scanning the squad. Her gaze crossed Augusta’s, and stopped. Alcina, Augusta realised with a cold shock, was not just watching Melia. But the Sister Superior did not permit herself a reaction, and she opened their briefing as usual. ‘My Sisters,’ she said. ‘In the name of Holy Terra and the God-Emperor of Mankind, I entreat your attention and your vigilance.’ ‘Our vigilance is constant.’ The squad’s answers were clear and strong – they had done this many times. ‘We stand against the heretic, the xenos and the traitor. We carry His word and His light to every corner of the Imperium, and beyond. Cave ne saltem arce hostes. Let our foes beware.’ ‘Let our foes beware,’ the Sister Superior returned the salutation, and said, ‘We have been issued our orders, Sisters. As of this moment, we are in a full-combat situation.’ Carefully, she outlined the details. ‘We will observe vox silence until the command is given otherwise. We will bear full armour and weapons at all times. We will sleep in shifts, until the order is given to mobilise.’ She nodded at the pallets down one side of the trench. ‘All combat directives will come directly from the canoness to her Sisters Superior, from whom they will be relayed.’ She paused, feeling the strength of the moment – an uplift of hope and favour. ‘Truly, the Emperor has blessed us. It has been many years since our Order stood at muster. We will carry His name, His rage, and His glory out to the coming battle.’ ‘Ave Imperator.’ Alcina voiced the salute, her tone severe. ‘Ave Imperator.’ The others echoed her, but Augusta could hear their tension – they were waiting for the canoness’ verdict. For the news of their fate. Akemi was frowning, and her lips moved in silent prayer. ‘Sisters,’ Augusta said. ‘Before I begin the briefing proper, I bring word of the Order’s decision.’ Melia looked up sharply. Akemi bit her lip. ‘We must offer our thanks for His justice and mercy,’ Augusta told them. ‘We will be keeping our–’ ‘We’re not going to be…?’ Viola left the word ‘Repentia’ unsaid, as if it were too terrible to voice. Sister Alcina shifted, letting her armour scrape. She gave the back of Viola’s head a glare, then raised an eyebrow at Augusta. ‘You permit your squad to interrupt you?’ Her tone was harsh, and Augusta tensed. She continued to speak, her voice carefully neutral. ‘Due to her seniority, Sister Alcina will be taking the position of my second-in-command.’ She glanced at Melia, saw the dark flash that passed across her gaze, though she said nothing. ‘Sister Rhea will be acting as lookout, as Sister Caia is attending the canoness. And in answer to your query,’ Augusta addressed her new second, her tone firm, ‘my squad have waited two solar weeks for the canoness’ verdict, and the courage they have shown has been admirable.’ She flicked a warning glance at Viola. ‘You are correct, however – I do not tolerate an interruption at a briefing.’ Viola twitched and lowered her gaze, and Augusta went on. ‘Under normal circumstances, I would likewise not field new Sisters in this squad until we had trained together. Here, however, such indulgence is not practical. I expect you to follow my orders, Sisters.’ Sister Alcina paused as if weighing what Augusta had said, and then responded, her tone measured, ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior.’ ‘Ave Imperator,’ Augusta returned. ‘I trust that this squad, with its new members, will carry the name of Saint Mina and the Emperor’s light as it has always done, and that we will discover our discipline and unity in the face of the enemy.’ Sister Rhea repeated, ‘Ave Imperator.’ ‘Very well.’ Augusta nodded. ‘I will continue.’ Carefully, she moved the electro-candles and the small refectorium effigy aside and laid her dataslate on the narrow central table. The slate’s glassy surface was already flowing with slowly scrolling maps. The squad moved closer to look. Using her quill, the Sister Superior pointed at the screen. For the benefit of the two new members, she said, ‘You are already aware that Vastum was a forge world, stripped of its resources, and then abandoned. During our prior mission here we discovered a concealed force that the departing Mechanicus had somehow overlooked.’ From somewhere, further out in the complex, the Terce hymnal rose into the pipework, making the metal sing, high and pure. Augusta continued, ‘The Imperial frigate Kyrus has been watching this force. She has also been scanning Vastum’s surface for any further caches of machines.’ The hymn rose to a crystal crescendo, a rise of thanks for the day, and for the coming confrontation. Augusta felt herself shiver – that familiar, glorious rush of battle-anticipation. She said, ‘And she has found them.’ ‘There are more?’ Akemi breathed. ‘In total,’ Augusta said, ‘six of Vastum’s one hundred and forty-four factoria have been found to contain a substantial force.’ For the benefit of the two new Sisters, she outlined, ‘Kataphrons – Breachers and Destroyers. Kastelans. A few Ironstriders. The Kyrus estimates two hundred single operational units.’ She paused, letting the squad catch up. ‘That’s quite an army,’ Melia commented, thoughtfully. ‘How do you overlook a force that large?’ Augusta said, ‘We are familiar with the enemy commander. We encountered the heretek Questor Rayos on our previous mission. And we have already witnessed that her machines are scratch-built, frequently lacking their full or correct armament.’ Augusta paused, looking around at her Sisters, their red shoulders framed by the Order’s banners. ‘Rayos was a trader in machine-parts and information,’ Akemi said, nodding. ‘She’s been building them.’ ‘Do not underestimate Rayos’ resources, or abilities,’ Augusta said. She nudged the dataslate and the map shifted. The squad leaned forwards, the screen’s illumination bathing their faces. Now, the illustration had changed. In close-up it was showing a ragged scatter of rough, dark blotches, tracing their way across the planet’s watery surface like a disease. Connecting several of these was a series of long and slowly curving black stripes. ‘This is a volcanic island chain,’ Augusta said, ‘connected by a series of roads. As we can see, this cluster here intersects with one of our occupied factoria. We,’ – she tapped the slate with the quill, indicating one of the dark islands at the cluster’s outermost edge – ‘are here. Forge temple and administratum zero-point-seven-seven.’ A whisper of hymn came through the pipes, ethereal and stirring. The hairs on Augusta’s neck stood on end. ‘At the other end of this island chain,’ Augusta said, ‘waits this planet’s primary citadel.’ A new light flared on the screen’s surface. ‘It covers approximately three square miles, and encompasses the main factorum as well as the central forge temple. It is also the only place upon this cesspit of a world that still holds an operational orbital launch–point. For the last two weeks, Rayos’ forces have been converging upon this location.’ ‘If they’re all in one place,’ Viola asked, ‘why doesn’t the Kyrus just launch an orbital strike?’ Alcina gave the red-haired Sister a sharp look, but Viola ignored her, still studying the screen. The Sister Superior answered, her words pointed. ‘The citadel is defended by an Emanatus force field. Our duty is to take that force field down. Sister Rhea,’ Augusta nodded at the newcomer, ‘has seen this device before, and will be able to identify and disable it.’ ‘In His name,’ Rhea said, ‘I will not fail.’ ‘We pray for His blessing, Sister,’ Augusta said. ‘The road between us and the citadel is over two hundred miles. The Kyrus reports that it is currently empty, but it may not remain so once we begin our advance. Please remember that we expect to be heavily outnumbered.’ She looked around at her Sisters, meeting each gaze, making sure they understood. ‘This is why the canoness’ adjutant, Sister Aitamah, has remained at the convent.’ Silence followed her words, and a chill breath stole through the metal room, stirring the hangings. The hymn had stopped, and its absence was suddenly echoing-loud. Viola’s hands tightened on the heavy bolter, and Akemi scribbled frantically on her dataslate. In the quiet, Sister Rhea was muttering the words of the litany, ‘A morte perpetua…’ Melia asked, her velvet voice cool, ‘Does Rayos have ships incoming?’ Augusta said, ‘Neither the Kyrus nor the Lux Sancta have reported incoming ships – but the canoness suspects it will not be long. The Lux Sancta has left orbit, and the Kyrus does not carry the armament for a battle, so we must move with speed.’ ‘Sister, may I ask a question?’ Akemi was running the numbers, assembling her data like she was a tech-priest herself. ‘We have seen that Rayos’ forces are scratch-built – do we have further details of her army?’ ‘We have the last known data from the Kyrus’ scans,’ Augusta told her. ‘We do not have the data from the citadel itself, as our scanners cannot penetrate the rock.’ The youngest Sister frowned at her dataslate, trying to work it out. ‘The canoness’ brief is very clear.’ Augusta picked up the screen and looked round at the five faces, her new squad, their armour glinting in the electro-candlelight. ‘We must reach the orbital platform before Rayos’ force can leave the planet. And if we must fight our way along every mile of road, then that is His will. ‘We face a trying battle, my Sisters. And may He be with us.’ Following the briefing, Augusta went to the Order’s chapel, one of the old forge temple’s transepts, now decorated with a full-sized embroidered banner depicting the God-Emperor Himself, His head haloed in Sol’s light, His flaming blade in hand. Around Him, the brass pipes had been cleaned, and carefully placed electro-candles made them shine like a promise. There was no servitor to take her weapons and she was under combat orders, but carrying them in His presence still felt wrong. Augusta walked up the short aisle and dropped to one knee, her head bowed. Her steel-grey hair fell forwards, hiding her face. ‘Tibi gratias ago tibi Imperatore.’ Thank you, my Emperor. With the briefings over and her orders clear, she had come to offer the Litany of Thanksgiving – for His judgment, and for the justice and wisdom of her Order. She had not realised how much she had feared the loss of her armour, and her honour. And there was no place for fear – or pride – in His presence. Only for service. She stayed kneeling for a moment, then came back to her feet, her head still bowed. A deep voice behind her said, ‘Sister Superior?’ The words were quiet, respectful. She turned, her boots scraping on the stone. Behind her, at the very edge of the transept, two figures were also rising. They were very young, their battered gear was brown and green and Militarum, and their lasrifles were held tight at their sides, like some third limb. One of them was long and lean and dark-skinned, the other shorter and stockier with a scar through his eyebrow. ‘Mors,’ she said, to the man who had spoken. ‘Rufus.’ The two soldiers were the last survivors of the deserter squad that had been guarding the doomed inquisitor. It had been Mors who had pulled the trigger and sent the sizzle of his lasrifle through Istrix’s unwary skull. Both men offered her the sign of the aquila. Gravely, she returned the salute. They glanced at each other with a flicker of awkwardness – they obviously wanted to say something, but they were two lone soldiers in the centre of a full deployment of the Adepta Sororitas, and they were both self-conscious and very out of place. Augusta said, ‘You wish to ask me a question, corporal?’ ‘No longer corporal, Sister,’ Mors said, ‘though the canoness has let us keep our gear.’ She stopped herself smiling at his rueful tone. ‘What do you need?’ ‘Sister…’ Mors glanced up at the embroidered banner and straightened his shoulders. ‘Rufus and I are assigned to your squad.’ ‘So I understand,’ she said. ‘And I’m glad to have you, both of you. You have proven your courage and faith many times.’ ‘Our orders are clear,’ Mors said. He pulled his shoulders back even further, let out his breath. ‘We’re still deserters, Sister, and we’re to offer our lives in the service of the Emperor.’ ‘Aye.’ Augusta nodded slowly, understanding. ‘You have been given the opportunity to attain redemption. To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. You should be proud.’ ‘We are,’ Rufus said. ‘We shot an inquisitor. It’s more than we deserve.’ Both men relapsed to their slightly awkward silence, and Augusta said, ‘The Order musters at Lauds, and we will commence our advance along the roadway. My squad have been assigned a Repressor, and we will take our position at the second line of the left flank. You will report to that location.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Return to your prayers, both of you,’ she told them. ‘I will expect you in the morning.’ As the soldiers returned to their kneel, Augusta squared her shoulders and turned to look up at the banner, its gold embroidery glittering like the pipework that surrounded it. He stared out over the transept, His face severe. To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. And the Sister Superior wondered… Had her squad been offered the same?",

That He walks with every Sister as she carries His name into the void, that He hears the words of every hymn, the thunder of every weapon, the battle cry of every warrior. It is also written that wherever forces are gathered in His name, there He shall be. ‘Ubi autem ambulat, ibi non potest esse deficiendi.’ Wherever He walks, there can be no failure. After the canoness’ briefing, Sister Augusta returned to her squad in their makeshift dormitorium – an abandoned hopper-trench now warmed by the richly decorated rose banners of their Order. Pipes and conduits wove their way down a long, half-cylindrical ceiling and, at the far end, an altar now stood to His might and presence. Standing before it, the Sisters recited, softly and together: ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death, That Thou shouldst spare none, That Thou shouldst pardon none, We beseech Thee, destroy them.’ As the litany came to a close, the newly reformed squad stood in silence, heads bowed and armour gleaming.

      "content": "CHAPTER THREE A filthy, rust-red dawn. The hymn of Lauds, its close harmonies rising into the early morning dirt. ‘O Imperator, et Sol Iustitiae…’ O Emperor, the Sun of Justice… Lycheate’s aged, bloated star was still below the horizon, and the grubby brown sky was layered with clouds like brass and blood. Scoured by dusty wind, the Sisters’ muster point was a small black stone island, little more than an upthrust rock. Foul waters battered its jagged coastline, and all of its surrounding walkways had been collapsed, bar one. Its last metal bridge stood alone, creaking in the dawn wind. In front of the old forge temple steps, however, there stretched a flat expanse of hard standing, and, as the sun’s leading edge brought a flare to the sky, so an answering flash of scarlet came from the force that was assembled beneath it. Immolators, Repressors and Exorcists; twelve vehicles in perfect formation. Waiting. The hymn rose to a crescendo. ‘Imperator, nos hic ut laudis declate Tua!’ Emperor, hear us as we declare Your praise! Augusta, standing with her squad beside the hard red flank of their assigned Repressor, let her hands fall to her weapons. This was a celebration of the Emperor’s dawn, of the rise of Sol over distant Terra – a sight she had never seen, but one that still began her every day. Perhaps, one day, she would make the Pilgrimage… …if she were blessed enough. But today, she had another calling. To Augusta’s right, on the far side of their Repressor’s steel solidity, stood the Order of the Bloody Rose, its red banners flapping. In the lead, the four Immolators, commanded by Sister Mikaela. Behind them, the Immolator of the canoness herself, its pipes and banners shouting loud colours into the brown dawn. Then the rank of three Repressors, Augusta’s squad on the left flank, Eleni’s on the right, and Roku’s in the centre. Behind the Repressors, there waited Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim, their jump packs ready and rumbling. And lastly, at the very rear, four of the Sanctorum-pattern Exorcists, built on Ophelia VII and more reliable than the older Prioris models. The vehicles’ blaze of scarlet was powerful, as bright as new blood. This was the Rose, and it was ready for war. The Hymn of Lauds came to an end, the note like an expectation; the canoness’ vox-coder blasted clear trumpets, the clarion call of muster and battle. The assembled tanks began to growl, like canids on leashes. They sounded like they, too, were eager to encounter resistance. Feeling her adrenaline rise, Augusta uttered a prayer of her own… ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them!’ Standing in the back of her Immolator, her banner aloft, the canoness lifted her arms and her voice. ‘My Sisters!’ Across the vox-coder, her shout carried like a tantara. ‘Though we walk far from Terra, still we see His glorious dawn! Even at the farthest reaches of the Imperium, His light touches us and fills us with fire! We are His word, His will, His blade!’ Augusta felt her heart rate rise, felt the filthy wind sting her skin. Her breath was catching, now, on the metal tang that was Lycheate’s bitter atmosphere, that was war and retribution. Ianthe’s cry was a beacon. ‘And no foe – not heretic, not witch, not xenos – can withstand our wrath!’ As one, the company thundered, ‘We fear no heretic! We fear no witch! We fear no xenos!’ The tanks snarled their eagerness. Ahead of them waited the ferrocrete roadway, stretching long and bleak between the scatters of islands. Water lashed and clawed at its edges, and along its left-hand side ran a double line of servohauler tracks, rusted and unusable. The sun rose further, making the far horizon glitter, though its angles of metal were too distant to see clearly. The light swelled across the tanks’ scarlet gleam, and touched the canoness herself. Her ice-white hair became a pure, cold blaze. She was still shouting, calling out to their hearts and to their faith. ‘The lost forces of this forge world have been uncovered, and scavenged, and twisted to the powers of darkness! The war machines of Vastum, once warriors of the Omnissiah, now stand corrupted! And we will overcome them, Sisters. We will not permit the heretek Rayos to take her stolen army outwards to the void!’ Ianthe’s voice was absolute power, unassailable. Beneath it, now, music rose – the rousing sound of the Dies Irae. ‘We will not permit this heresy!’ The word emerged with the first drum-crash of the music. Augusta could see the flare of flame in the eyes of her Sisters; feel the light that lifted them all from within. The two soldiers stood at rigid attention, their rifles by their sides, their chins raised to the wind. ‘My Sisters!’ Ianthe gave one last, great shout. ‘We stand here by the Accords of Hydraphur – by the word of Saint Mina, by her blade and her courage. By the blessing of the God-Emperor and by His guidance! We are the Adepta Sororitas, and since the Age of Apostasy, our Sisters and we have stood at the gates to hell. Only we can stand sentinel here. And we say – enough!’ At the shout, hydraulics whined and the hatch of Augusta’s Repressor came down to provide a ramp. ‘Let this corroding world know the wrath of the Rose!’ One resounding response came from every throat. The Order, in unison, returned, ‘Ave Imperator!’ The sheer strength of it brought a shiver to the Sister Superior’s skin. She saw that Viola’s green eyes blazed; alight with ferocity. A final, held note from the vox-coder, and then a moment of prayer and quiet. The banners danced and snapped; water splashed at the rocks and hissed as it withdrew. At last, the canoness shouted, ‘Sisters… embark!’ ‘Ave Imperator!’ There was a single unified stamp of boots as the Order broke formation. And the mission began. Augusta’s squad knew the drill; they banged up the ramp to the cold metal of the Repressor’s belly. Metal seats lined its outside; tiny slits in the walls offered them a limited view and allowed them to fire at the enemy. Pauldrons scraped on steel as they sat. It was dim in there, and it smelled of oil and fervour. Between the window-slits the walls were inscribed with battle-prayers, and the engine’s zealous grumble reverberated through the metal. In the front of the vehicle sat a figure in scarlet under­armour, the padding overlain by plates of flexsteel that defended the wearer’s chest, shoulders and belly – drivers’ armour. She was not someone that Augusta knew. ‘Sister Superior,’ the young woman nodded, then turned back to the controls. ‘I’m Sister Cindal. May His grace and strength ride with us.’ ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Cindal,’ Augusta returned. ‘We place ourselves in your hands, and in His.’ In the vox-coder, the blare of trumpets sounded again. Ianthe’s voice: ‘Order… forward!’ And in the dirty red flare of the early morning light, the Sisters rolled onwards to war. At first, they met no resistance. The roadway was long, stretching silent over the wind-blown water, and it was desolate in its emptiness. This far from their target the tanks were moving at an easy three-quarter speed, fast enough to eat the distance but slow enough to react to an ambush, should one occur. The Seraphim jumped and swooped, short bursts of hit-and-run energy that conserved their fuel and allowed them to keep pace with the vehicles. Augusta would catch occasional flashes of scarlet as they came into view and then vanished again. As a younger woman she had harboured a deep wish to be amongst their number and had trained hard to hone her skills – but her dislike of heights had undone her. Her twinge of envy was unbecoming, and her place was His will. She turned back to the prayers along the inside of the tank. Slowly, the hours moved from Lauds to Prime, and the sun struggled upwards, weary and swollen. Slowly, lines of light from the window-slots moved across the tank’s interior. Outside, the filthy waters grew as wide as the horizon; they rolled and sloshed at the roadside, splashing garbage and remains. At the front of the company, the Immolators’ auspex searched for mines, and found nothing; above them, the Kyrus’ scans were constant and thorough. And the formation rolled onwards, keeping the dead servohauler tracks to its left. Augusta could only wait, and pray. She sat in the back of the Repressor, her Godwyn De’az-pattern bolter rested across her lap, her eyes watching the tiny passing slice of Lycheate’s polluted sea. This was the part of the battle that the Sister Superior disliked – she was restless, impatient. She wanted to be outside, singing, chainsword in hand, and cutting through the ranks of the enemy. ‘A spiritu dominatus…’ But that moment would come. She held herself still, calmly reciting the words of the litany and hearing her Sisters echo her, one line at a time. ‘Domine, libra nos.’ The tank rolled on, and the soft rumble of its tracks was like a heartbeat. Nothing, it seemed, was daring to stand in their way. ‘Company, halt.’ The vehicles stopped at the canoness’ vox command. Caught in the semi-dark, stuck in the chill belly of the Repressor, there was nothing Augusta could do. She could see a narrow slice of road and water, nothing else – no enemy, no target. Frustrated, she held her position, her bolter at the weapon-port, listening to the voices in her vox-bead. Mikaela reported from the lead Immolator, ‘Enemy sighted – two kastelans. Both stationary. One armed. They’re standing in the water, flanking the roadway. At a guess, milady, they’re lookout duty.’ ‘We will send Rayos a message of intent. Immolators, advance to heavy-bolter range, and halt,’ the canoness replied. Augusta’s Repressor was a transport and comparatively lightly armed – it held its position, its engine grumbling in protest. In its belly, the squad sat poised, their tension almost crackling in the air. Sister Mikaela’s voice came through the vox once more. ‘Within range. Enemy still motionless.’ ‘Immolators, heavy bolters, target the armed machine. Controlled, directed bursts. Conserve your ammunition, Sisters. And fire!’ the canoness ordered. Muffled by the Repressor’s steel shell, Augusta heard the heavy bolters’ booms and rattles, heard the hard, explosive detonations as the rounds struck their target. The air shook with repeated impacts. Her hands tight on her bolter, she craned to see, needed to know what was happening. But her only knowledge of the battle came from Mikaela over the vox. ‘Right-hand kastelan damaged. Both machines now in motion.’ ‘Same target. Fire!’ the canoness ordered. The bolters fired again, the sounds seeming to echo like ricochets through the inside of the tank. Augusta sat still, her shoulders tight, and saw that the others were doing the same. Viola, crouched at her weapon-port, moved her heavy bolter in an arc, seeking something – anything – to put in her sights. She wanted to fight; her recitation of the litany was full of suppressed rage. Mors and Rufus, likewise, had lasrifles ready to fire. They did not share the Sisters’ prayer, but they were remarkably steady, watching and waiting. ‘Incoming!’ Augusta held her breath. Somewhere ahead of them: one colossal boom. It struck the roadway, shaking their Repressor where it stood. She found herself trying to calculate – how far away the Immolators were, how much damage the kastelan could inflict. She knew the drill well enough – the Immolators would draw the enemy’s fire, ensuring the safety of the transports… Until the foot-troops could be effectively deployed. By the Throne! She wanted to be out there, not held helpless here in the half-light. In the vox, she could hear Mikaela praying, her voice livid with courage and fury. Annoyed by her enforced idleness, the Sister Superior echoed Mikaela’s words… That thou shouldst bring them only death! ‘Damage?’ the canoness asked. ‘Incendiary damage to the front plates, solidity still at eighty per cent,’ Mikaela replied. ‘The roadway has a crater, but the supports are holding – it’s shooting directly for us.’ ‘He is with you, Sister – trust in His wisdom,’ the canoness said, her words like the call of trumpets: ‘Same target. Fire!’ Again, the heavy rattle of bolters. There was the rasping grumble of tank tracks – the Immolators were moving, but Augusta couldn’t tell if it was forward or back. Her blindness was infuriating; her hand tightened even harder on the bolter. She needed to be out there, fighting for her Sisters, but still, she could feel the rush of His presence in the sounds of the battle, in her Order’s manoeuvring, and in the canoness’ experience… Someone behind Augusta – Rufus, she thought – muttered a savage expletive. She knew how he felt. ‘Machine down! Both legs damaged, it’s crashed into the water. Now fully submerged. The other one’s climbing onto the roadway.’ Once more, Ianthe thundered the command. ‘Fire!’ The rattle of the bolters sounded again, then Mikaela cried a prayer – pure, savage, celebration: ‘In nomine Eius!’ In His name! A second later, her report followed. ‘Machine down! I think we caught them by surprise.’ ‘Or they’re a warning, testing our mettle.’ The canoness’ tone was wry. ‘Either way, the enemy knows that we’re on the move, and it knows where we are – we must maintain full alertness. Is the roadway compromised, Sister?’ ‘No, milady,’ Mikaela said. ‘The damage is surface only and both kastelans are down. They’re fully submerged.’ ‘You’re strong, Mikaela. He walks at your side.’ The edge in Ianthe’s voice was keen. ‘Sisters, we must still expect to encounter the foe. Keep all scanners open. And may our hymns bring fear to the heart of the heretek.’ The vox crackled again, and went silent. In the semi-darkness of the back of the Repressor, Augusta commented to her squad, ‘Maintain your vigilance, my Sisters. The canoness is right – this is only the beginning.’ Standing in the back of the canoness’ Immolator, Sister Caia had heard every word. She stood at Ianthe’s shoulder, the glittering organ pipes and the Order’s blood-red banner rising behind her. The heavy reinforced fabric occasionally buffeted her shoulders, as if to remind her of this new duty, of its weight and seriousness. The wind was dirty and full of grit, and everything stank of cordite and promethium. Watching the rumble and muzzle-flash of the advancing tanks, Sister Caia gripped the edge of the cupola with one scarlet gauntlet, held her auspex in the other. She should be down there, alongside her Sisters. She should be waiting to disembark, to rage and fight and fire… But no. She had to stand here, above it, like she was forbidden to take part. And something about this new role was giving her a terrible and growing apprehension… Surely, not now, not after this long… They couldn’t… Could they? Even as far back as the schola, Caia had never spoken of her childhood, her family. She’d only ever wanted to be a warrior. I want to fight, to use my bolter for His glory, not… Ianthe, however, had offered her only a basic briefing: Caia had previous experience of the Lycheate forces, and she was here to observe. And that was all. Dominica’s eyes! Caia thought to herself. If my calling has changed, would it be blasphemy to refuse? Before the Immolator’s rumbling tracks the roadway was black and pitted, and stretched onwards as far as she could see. The kastelans had been stood like some sort of ancient guardians, one to either side of the road, and up to their knees in the water. The first one had been stubborn, refusing to fall despite significant damage – but its incendiary weapon had not penetrated the lead tank’s armour and it had proved no match for the Immolators’ heavy bolters. Both machines had been shot down and had splashed backwards, there to rot away. The Order’s first skirmish had been flawlessly executed, and it had brought courage to Caia’s heart. The canoness, however, was more thoughtful. Ianthe said, ‘Sister Caia. What is your assessment of the confrontation?’ Without hesitation, Caia answered, ‘Its execution was precise, milady.’ ‘And the enemy?’ Ianthe said. ‘Perimeter lookout. By their corrosion marks, they’ve been stood there for many years.’ ‘Good.’ She said nothing else, just turned back to the road. In the belly of the vehicle, Rhene, the old Hospitaller, cackled aloud. Her voice floated up to them, ‘You keep your eyes open, Sister Caia de Musa!’ Carefully, Caia answered her, ‘I will do my best, Sister.’ ‘You’d better!’ The old Hospitaller cackled again. ‘You never know what He might have in store for you!’ She tapped the side of her nose, and then, snorting with humour, dissolved into random mutterings. Caia’s tension twisted harder, becoming dark with fear. No, they can’t do this to me… Not now… Not after this long… The tanks rolled on. Caia stayed silent, watching her auspex. She must follow His calling, wherever it may lead. Yet, deny it though she might, the thin smoke of her tension remained. Lycheate’s metallic weather was capricious, and the wind had dropped as if torn from the sky. Around them, the water lay like dirty brass, still and flat. It stretched in all directions, oil-slicks gleaming like rainbows upon its surface; in places, the dead supports of fallen roadways emerged to spike at the sky. On the far horizon, the rusting metal silhouettes of the main factoria could just be seen, flashing in the light of the still-rising sun. The ruin of this place was huge, and hollow, and it stank. They rolled on. Slowly, the roadway broadened and became pocked with craters. More and more great scalloped bites had been taken from its edges, places where the ferrocrete had crumbled from the forces ranged about it. At one point, one of the supports had sagged completely and the road dipped almost to the waterline, though it remained intact. Here, the canoness gave orders to slow and progress with caution. As the vehicles dared the dip she prayed ceaselessly, her words strong and urgent – almost as if the vehicles’ grumbling spirits could hear her, and take courage. Her eyes were constantly narrowed; she watched the company’s formation intently, alert for the ambush. But there was nothing. Rayos, Caia knew, had complete confidence in her own calculations. However the Sisters advanced, the heretek would surely have factored it into her data. So, when the ambush came, it would be in the most effective place. The company traversed the dip successfully, and moved on. As Prime rose to Terce, however, and to midmorning prayers, they closed on the first factorum. Over the vox, Ianthe gave orders: ‘Distance: one mile. Slow to one-quarter speed, all scanners.’ As the vehicles slowed, she said, ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘Milady?’ The clouds were clearing now, but the air was still bitterly cold. Before them, the roadway had become significantly wider, flattening onto an island and encircled by jagged, volcanic spikes. Here, there was a junction – one side of the road turned right, and stopped at a clearly defined building, with distinct, square corners of glittering basalt. The other side, the main route, curved left and continued onwards over the water. The lines of the servohauler tracks likewise branched to follow both roads, and here, they gleamed with the oil of recent repair. Clearly, this was where the enemy’s territory began. The canoness said, ‘Your assessment please.’ Caia immediately responded: ‘They have cover, and the possibility of a flanking manoeuvre if we move forwards too far. If we are to be assaulted, then this is where that assault will take place.’ ‘My thoughts also,’ Ianthe said. ‘Captain?’ ‘Regrettably, canoness, the debris field is interfering with the Kyrus’ scans. I can see nothing in motion, but I fear I cannot give you more assurance.’ Ianthe nodded grimly, then said, over the vox, ‘Sister Mikaela. Situation?’ ‘My auspex shows nothing. Roadway and waters all reading as empty.’ ‘There may be a stationary force,’ Caia said. ‘The larger machines may be concealed by the water. Or perhaps something smaller and lighter, that the Kyrus would miss.’ ‘I agree,’ Ianthe said. Then, over the vox, she said, ‘Company, weapons ready, all scanners. Sister Nikaya, hold your position, be ready to jump on my command.’ ‘Milady,’ the Seraphim Superior answered. The company slowed further, crawling along the road. Below where Caia stood, Rhene began to sing the litany, her old voice thin and querulous. Unease prickled through Caia’s shoulders. The water glittered; the rocks were black as Ruin. In her ten years with her squad, Caia had developed an almost instinctive knowledge of these situations, a real awareness as to where the ambushes would occur… Her heart pounded. The banner flapped at her, nudging her shoulders as if taunting her with her new role. Rhene continued to sing. And then… There! ‘Contact! Multiple signals!’ shouted Mikaela. Caia’s estimation had been correct. Rayos, it seemed, had marshalled her first ambush.",

The hymn of Lauds, its close harmonies rising into the early morning dirt. ‘O Imperator, et Sol Iustitiae…’ O Emperor, the Sun of Justice… Lycheate’s aged, bloated star was still below the horizon, and the grubby brown sky was layered with clouds like brass and blood. Scoured by dusty wind, the Sisters’ muster point was a small black stone island, little more than an upthrust rock. Foul waters battered its jagged coastline, and all of its surrounding walkways had been collapsed, bar one. Its last metal bridge stood alone, creaking in the dawn wind. In front of the old forge temple steps, however, there stretched a flat expanse of hard standing, and, as the sun’s leading edge brought a flare to the sky, so an answering flash of scarlet came from the force that was assembled beneath it. Immolators, Repressors and Exorcists; twelve vehicles in perfect formation. Waiting. The hymn rose to a crescendo. ‘Imperator, nos hic ut laudis declate Tua!’ Emperor, hear us as we declare Your praise! Augusta, standing with her squad beside the hard red flank of their assigned Repressor, let her hands fall to her weapons. This was a celebration of the Emperor’s dawn, of the rise of Sol over distant Terra – a sight she had never seen, but one that still began her every day.

The Hymn of Lauds came to an end, the note like an expectation; the canoness’ vox-coder blasted clear trumpets, the clarion call of muster and battle. The assembled tanks began to growl, like canids on leashes. They sounded like they, too, were eager to encounter resistance.

She knew how he felt. ‘Machine down! Both legs damaged, it’s crashed into the water. Now fully submerged. The other one’s climbing onto the roadway.’ Once more, Ianthe thundered the command. ‘Fire!’ The rattle of the bolters sounded again, then Mikaela cried a prayer – pure, savage, celebration: ‘In nomine Eius!’ In His name! A second later, her report followed. ‘Machine down! I think we caught them by surprise.’ ‘Or they’re a warning, testing our mettle.’ The canoness’ tone was wry. ‘Either way, the enemy knows that we’re on the move, and it knows where we are – we must maintain full alertness. Is the roadway compromised, Sister?’ ‘No, milady,’ Mikaela said. ‘The damage is surface only and both kastelans are down. They’re fully submerged.’ ‘You’re strong, Mikaela. He walks at your side.’ The edge in Ianthe’s voice was keen. ‘Sisters, we must still expect to encounter the foe. Keep all scanners open. And may our hymns bring fear to the heart of the heretek.’ The vox crackled again, and went silent. In the semi-darkness of the back of the Repressor, Augusta commented to her squad, ‘Maintain your vigilance, my Sisters. The canoness is right – this is only the beginning.’ Standing in the back of the canoness’ Immolator, Sister Caia had heard every word. She stood at Ianthe’s shoulder, the glittering organ pipes and the Order’s blood-red banner rising behind her. The heavy reinforced fabric occasionally buffeted her shoulders, as if to remind her of this new duty, of its weight and seriousness. The wind was dirty and full of grit, and everything stank of cordite and promethium. Watching the rumble and muzzle-flash of the advancing tanks, Sister Caia gripped the edge of the cupola with one scarlet gauntlet, held her auspex in the other. She should be down there, alongside her Sisters. She should be waiting to disembark, to rage and fight and fire… But no. She had to stand here, above it, like she was forbidden to take part. And something about this new role was giving her a terrible and growing apprehension… Surely, not now, not after this long… They couldn’t… Could they? Even as far back as the schola, Caia had never spoken of her childhood, her family. She’d only ever wanted to be a warrior. I want to fight, to use my bolter for His glory, not… Ianthe, however, had offered her only a basic briefing: Caia had previous experience of the Lycheate forces, and she was here to observe. And that was all. Dominica’s eyes! Caia thought to herself. If my calling has changed, would it be blasphemy to refuse? Before the Immolator’s rumbling tracks the roadway was black and pitted, and stretched onwards as far as she could see. The kastelans had been stood like some sort of ancient guardians, one to either side of the road, and up to their knees in the water. The first one had been stubborn, refusing to fall despite significant damage – but its incendiary weapon had not penetrated the lead tank’s armour and it had proved no match for the Immolators’ heavy bolters. Both machines had been shot down and had splashed backwards, there to rot away. The Order’s first skirmish had been flawlessly executed, and it had brought courage to Caia’s heart. The canoness, however, was more thoughtful. Ianthe said, ‘Sister Caia. What is your assessment of the confrontation?’ Without hesitation, Caia answered, ‘Its execution was precise, milady.’ ‘And the enemy?’ Ianthe said. ‘Perimeter lookout. By their corrosion marks, they’ve been stood there for many years.’ ‘Good.’ She said nothing else, just turned back to the road. In the belly of the vehicle, Rhene, the old Hospitaller, cackled aloud. Her voice floated up to them, ‘You keep your eyes open, Sister Caia de Musa!’ Carefully, Caia answered her, ‘I will do my best, Sister.’ ‘You’d better!’ The old Hospitaller cackled again. ‘You never know what He might have in store for you!’ She tapped the side of her nose, and then, snorting with humour, dissolved into random mutterings. Caia’s tension twisted harder, becoming dark with fear. No, they can’t do this to me… Not now… Not after this long… The tanks rolled on. Caia stayed silent, watching her auspex. She must follow His calling, wherever it may lead. Yet, deny it though she might, the thin smoke of her tension remained. Lycheate’s metallic weather was capricious, and the wind had dropped as if torn from the sky. Around them, the water lay like dirty brass, still and flat. It stretched in all directions, oil-slicks gleaming like rainbows upon its surface; in places, the dead supports of fallen roadways emerged to spike at the sky. On the far horizon, the rusting metal silhouettes of the main factoria could just be seen, flashing in the light of the still-rising sun. The ruin of this place was huge, and hollow, and it stank. They rolled on. Slowly, the roadway broadened and became pocked with craters. More and more great scalloped bites had been taken from its edges, places where the ferrocrete had crumbled from the forces ranged about it. At one point, one of the supports had sagged completely and the road dipped almost to the waterline, though it remained intact. Here, the canoness gave orders to slow and progress with caution. As the vehicles dared the dip she prayed ceaselessly, her words strong and urgent – almost as if the vehicles’ grumbling spirits could hear her, and take courage. Her eyes were constantly narrowed; she watched the company’s formation intently, alert for the ambush. But there was nothing. Rayos, Caia knew, had complete confidence in her own calculations. However the Sisters advanced, the heretek would surely have factored it into her data. So, when the ambush came, it would be in the most effective place. The company traversed the dip successfully, and moved on. As Prime rose to Terce, however, and to midmorning prayers, they closed on the first factorum. Over the vox, Ianthe gave orders: ‘Distance: one mile. Slow to one-quarter speed, all scanners.’ As the vehicles slowed, she said, ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘Milady?’ The clouds were clearing now, but the air was still bitterly cold. Before them, the roadway had become significantly wider, flattening onto an island and encircled by jagged, volcanic spikes. Here, there was a junction – one side of the road turned right, and stopped at a clearly defined building, with distinct, square corners of glittering basalt. The other side, the main route, curved left and continued onwards over the water. The lines of the servohauler tracks likewise branched to follow both roads, and here, they gleamed with the oil of recent repair. Clearly, this was where the enemy’s territory began. The canoness said, ‘Your assessment please.’ Caia immediately responded: ‘They have cover, and the possibility of a flanking manoeuvre if we move forwards too far. If we are to be assaulted, then this is where that assault will take place.’ ‘My thoughts also,’ Ianthe said. ‘Captain?’ ‘Regrettably, canoness, the debris field is interfering with the Kyrus’ scans. I can see nothing in motion, but I fear I cannot give you more assurance.’ Ianthe nodded grimly, then said, over the vox, ‘Sister Mikaela. Situation?’ ‘My auspex shows nothing. Roadway and waters all reading as empty.’ ‘There may be a stationary force,’ Caia said. ‘The larger machines may be concealed by the water. Or perhaps something smaller and lighter, that the Kyrus would miss.’ ‘I agree,’ Ianthe said. Then, over the vox, she said, ‘Company, weapons ready, all scanners. Sister Nikaya, hold your position, be ready to jump on my command.’ ‘Milady,’ the Seraphim Superior answered. The company slowed further, crawling along the road. Below where Caia stood, Rhene began to sing the litany, her old voice thin and querulous. Unease prickled through Caia’s shoulders. The water glittered; the rocks were black as Ruin. In her ten years with her squad, Caia had developed an almost instinctive knowledge of these situations, a real awareness as to where the ambushes would occur… Her heart pounded. The banner flapped at her, nudging her shoulders as if taunting her with her new role. Rhene continued to sing. And then… There! ‘Contact! Multiple signals!’ shouted Mikaela. Caia’s estimation had been correct. Rayos, it seemed, had marshalled her first ambush.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FOUR Sister Caia didn’t know what the machines were, but they were bipedal, long-legged and fast. The tanks were crawling slowly around the long curve in the road, and the Immolators had almost reached the junction. The servohauler tracks gleamed with intent, and upthrust jags of black rock were scattered to each side of the roadway, like a hill-range of spikes that protected the road from the water. Watching for the attack, the Sisters’ voices carried on the brown air – a bugle of challenge. And with them, a powerful counterpoint to their rising harmony, the canoness prayed, her voice a strong contralto, broadcasting the litany out through the vox-coder. ‘From the lightning and the tempest!’ The Immolators’ weapon-muzzles tracked back and forth, waiting. Then Caia said, like a breath of realisation, ‘Got them!’ Her auspex had blipped contact – four, no five, moving dots, all hidden among the rocks. Simultaneously, the Immolators caught the motion. As the machines came at them, the tanks’ weapons were already aiming. Caia had never seen their attackers before, but the canoness knew what they were. ‘Ironstriders.’ She said the word aloud, like a curse, then snapped into the vox, ‘Mikaela! Heavy bolters. Wide, continuous suppression, take as many of them down as you can. Repressors, halt and prepare to ­dis­embark!’ Reaching for her helmet, indicating for Caia to do likewise, she called down into the transport, ‘Rhene!’ The old Hospitaller creaked and grumbled. ‘Aye. I’ve seen autocannons before.’ Her tone sounded like resignation – as if she knew full well the damage these guns could do. And, as Caia closed the seal on her helm, she saw them open fire. She closed her teeth on a curse. Fast repeated muzzle flashes, oddly pale in the burnished ochre of the Lycheate morning. The weapons were heavy and long, their muzzles tracking from raised shields. An energy crackled about them, a mist of data that must surely be coming from Rayos herself; they shot at the Sisters while the machines were still running. It made their aim erratic, but– Throne! Heavy explosive rounds chewed up the roadway directly in front of the canoness’ Immolator. Ianthe snarled the litany in return, raging at them, almost as if she could deflect the ammunition by her faith alone. The other machines were aiming at the front rank, rounds hitting and detonating on thick ceramite armour. One hit a heavy bolter with perfect accuracy, and the weapon blossomed in flame. Metal graunched, plates buckled, tracks split and broke. On the right flank, Eleni’s Repressor took a clean hit. Even as its emergency ramp crashed to the floor, one of its twin thermic reactors ignited and blew. The force of the explosion rocked Caia where she stood; she made an effort not to duck. Shrapnel whistled past her; black smoke rose and billowed, obscuring her view. ‘Squad! Roll call!’ Eleni said over the vox. The canoness barked, ‘Watch your auspex, Sister Caia! There may be more.’ ‘Aye.’ Prayer and adrenaline thundered through Caia’s blood. She was trying to see Eleni through the smoke, but it was heavy and thick, and it hung like a shroud over the dead vehicle. She saw only isolated flashes of scarlet. In the fog, though, her auspex continued to track. Five blips were rapidly closing their distance on the assembled Sisters, and the Immolators had a swiftly shortening field of fire. Rayos, Caia realised, had calculated her ambush perfectly. ‘Mikaela!’ The canoness called the order. ‘Fire!’ A booming rattle as the tanks’ heavy bolters opened up. The smoke was billowing across the roadway now, limiting visibility, but Caia could see that the weapons were turning in an arc, hitting the enemy in the legs. Machine-armour sparked, rounds missed and exploded on the rocks. A rush of stone rumbled to the ground; the noise and dust were tremendous. As the smoke closed over the scene completely, she caught one machine toppling sideways, kicking and twitching. But the other four were still running, straight at the assembled Order. They had pilots, she thought, and she wondered briefly where the servitors had come from… But there was no time. Another order boomed through the vox: ‘Repressors, disembark!’ Behind them, the vehicles’ ramps crashed to the ground. Voices shouted, boots clanged on metal, and two armed squads of Sisters deployed in perfect formation, heavy bolter first, covering the others as they took position. Seeing them move, Eleni’s squad formed with them – a single line, five paces apart, heavy bolter at one end, flamer at the other. Spreading the machines’ targets, and making the autocannons’ success that much harder. In just a moment, the enemy would be past the front rank of vehicles, and closing on the Sisters. Caia found herself holding her breath. She felt very exposed, standing up there in the open, but the canoness showed no inclination to move. Ianthe stood like an icon, fire-red and furious, her plasma pistol ready in her hand as if she would wield pure destruction. She thundered, out over the vox-coder, ‘We beseech Thee, destroy them!’ A single shot from her pistol and an Ironstrider was toppling over itself, its entire head removed. Molten metal spread out across the roadway. Above it, the air was filling with trumpets and dirt and noise – the ongoing clatter of the tanks’ bolters, the heavy blasts of the explosive ammunition. The canoness was broadcasting the full litany, now, hard and strong, defiant. Her rage was palpable, and Caia breathed a prayer, feeling her own blood surge and roar. She wanted to be down there, bolter in hand. She looked for her squad; saw them at the outer left flank, their line made distinctive by the las-streaks of the two young soldiers. Mors and Rufus had their rifles tucked into their shoulders and aimed clean at the incoming enemy. Two figures of green in the centre of all that blood-red ceramite – but neither of them so much as twitched. Caia had only a split second to take all of this in, and then the command rang out, ‘Immolators, cease! Infantry, target the servitors. And fire!’ One solid volley: three squads, in unison, shot upwards at the running machines. In the onslaught of noise, Caia could pick out the deep, thunderous battering that was Viola’s thrice-blessed heavy bolter, the weapon raging as the litany came from the Sisters themselves. The canoness was pistol-in-hand, her voice lifted, and Caia found her hackles rising with the force of the moment. Another machine staggered under the incoming fire. It lurched, sparks racing across its surface, but it didn’t fall. Amid the confusion, Caia saw the twin streaks of red light that came from Mors and Rufus both; saw one of them hit a servitor, clean to the head. The figure rocked in its gunnery seat, toppled, and fell. Blood and oil splashed outwards as it struck the roadway. More smoke billowed in Caia’s face, and she lost her vision. As it cleared again, she saw that the machine had run two more paces and then had lost its heading, barging into its fellows and knocking them aside. Mors, Caia realised, blinking, was an extremely good shot. Watching, her breath held, she prayed that the staggering machine would falter, take its comrades with it when it fell, but it rapidly regained its trajectory and continued to run, straight at the Sisters. Its autocannon, however, had slumped forwards and ceased to fire. All three of the surviving machines were now closing on the standing lines of infantry. Before them, a red line across the black road, Sisters stood fearless and fast, still shooting, still singing, their close harmonics edged with focused rage. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death!’ Caia found herself echoing their words, repeating them over and over again – only death, only death – like a mantra. She had never seen a battle from a tank’s vantage, and she found her heart thumping hard in her chest. She wanted to be shooting, wanted to be on the ground. She wanted to be out there, amid the smoke and the noise and the slaughter; she wanted to stain her armour with the blood of her foe… She wanted to rage denial against this feared, final fate that was finally closing down upon her, the thing she’d dreaded since she’d been a wet-eared novitiate… I was called to be a warrior, and a warrior I will stay! As two of the three incoming machines opened fire, she saw one red-armoured figure fall, then another – but not her own squad, they were still on their feet. The smallest figure, Akemi, had stopped to change her magazine, the movement smooth as reflex. A second later, she was firing again, her bolter held hard in both hands, her aim true. Caia’s hands tightened on her auspex and bolter both… ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none!’ In front of her, the canoness shot again; she broadcast anger and defiance with her every sung note. In the belly of the tank, however, Rhene had stopped singing. She was muttering aloud, almost to herself, ‘Ironstriders. They’re sharpshooters, seen ’em before. On Melecantha. They ambushed us. So why are they running?’ Without thinking, Caia replied, ‘They’re trying to get behind us. There must be another wave!’ Ianthe barked, ‘Exorcists, on my command. Caia, watch that auspex!’ ‘Aye.’ Caia’s acknowledgement was echoed over the vox, and she lifted the auspex, watching. And it seemed her hunch had been right – the attacking machines weren’t slowing down. Two autocannons tracked round as they ran, and again, opened fire. One targeted the canoness. The other aimed straight for Sister Viola. On the ground, Augusta held her position, bolter and chain­sword in hand. She stood at the centre of her squad’s line, Mors on one side, Alcina on the other. Viola stood on the line’s inside, and Melia at its outermost edge – this was not a battle for flamers. Echoing the canoness’ thundered song, the Sister Superior’s voice reached a crescendo as Mors hit the servitor, but the machine was still running with its fellows, through the rising smoke and straight at them. In all the clouds of dirt, it took Augusta a split second to realise that the machine that had been hit was not firing. Without its pilot, it was simply following its last command, and, with His blessing, it would run straight off the edge of the road. She dismissed it, concentrating on the one closest. If that turning autocannon hit them, they would all be facing the Emperor. But Viola was still shooting, the booming clattering of the heavy bolter filling the filthy air. Shouting the words of the litany, she raised her aim as the thing came closer, shooting upwards and almost into its belly. It juddered under the bombardment, explosions opening like wounds all over its frame, but still, it kept coming. Its feet were big enough to crush Viola clean to the ground. Mors shot it again, his aim not as blessed, and his streak of fire went wide. Rufus was shouting something at him, though Augusta couldn’t hear. She said to Alcina, beside her, ‘Give me room.’ Alcina shot her a sharp look, but moved. As the thing readied itself to fire, the Sister Superior held her chainsword ready. To their right, the other running machines were keeping pace with their fellow. One was closing on the canoness’ Immolator, the other on the far flank. Augusta could only see them as a blur from the corner of her eye, but she knew what was coming. The running machines opened fire together, the autocannons seeming to shake the very sky. On the far flank, scarlet armour scattered, figures were thrown in the air like toys. In the centre, the machine chewed more holes in the roadway; the canoness’ Immolator rocked, but that was all. And in front of the squad… The autocannon was aimed at Viola, identifying the greatest threat. As it fired, its muzzle flaring with light, Viola hurled herself bodily backwards, still shooting. In front of her, the roadway became a series of craters, and steam and debris leapt into the air. Cursing, Viola rolled into a kneel. Still, she kept shooting. In the vox, the canoness: ‘Roku, right-hand machine, all bolters. Nikaya, right flank!’ Augusta heard the order, and understood that the Seraphim were moving to protect Eleni’s weakened squad, but the machine was almost on them now. She watched its foot rise, timed it as it came down, its impact shaking the road… Lashed out with the chainsword, straight at its ankle. The blade hit, bit, and got stuck. A second later the running foot raised once more, wrenching her shoulder and elbow and tearing the weapon from her grip. Grit scattered; she bit back a curse. She raised the bolter with the other hand, opened fire. Beside her, Alcina did the same. Rounds thundered; twin streaks of lasgun fire cut through the smoke. The combined shooting of the whole squad battered the thing as it ran through them, and closed on the Exorcists behind. And then, the damage was just too much. Its armour dented and blackened, its autocannon now blocked by its own body, it lurched and began to stagger. ‘It’s going to fall!’ The shout was Akemi, as the Ironstrider twitched, rocked, and then slowly toppled away from them. Augusta breathed a prayer of gratitude. As it fell, the crash was tremendous. Its servitor rolled free, but Melia was already there and a single flaming whoosh melted flesh and metal alike. A sickening, smoking smear was left on the roadway. Ash blew on the wind. Augusta went to retrieve her chainsword. With servitor and machine both down, she was already thinking about the rest of the battle. ‘Incoming!’ Caia cried the word aloud as five more contacts blipped on her auspex. ‘No – not incoming, they’ve stopped.’ The first wave of machines was down; the sheer, continuous onslaught of the combined bolter fire had just proved too much. Around the company, the roadway was devastation, pitted with craters, smeared by smoke and drifting with rising dirt. Four machines lay in ruins, their armour and pieces scattered. The fifth had simply run straight over the outermost curve of the roadway and vanished into the water. Not one of them had made it through the company to reach the other side – but the inflicted damage had been severe. At the right flank, Eleni’s squad had lost their Repressor, its driver, and two Sisters; a third was badly injured. Covered by the Seraphim, Eleni and her surviving squad-member had picked up the injured woman and had run for the canoness’ Immolator. Rhene, still grumbling, had lowered the ramp for long enough to let them embark, and then closed it again. Her muttering continued as she tended to the downed Sister. ‘Sister Roku.’ The canoness’ bark was unaffected by the damage. ‘Move outwards, defend the right flank. We’ll hold the centre.’ ‘Understood.’ On the left flank, Augusta’s squad was unhurt, but in the centre, the canon­ess’ vehicle had taken significant fire – its top and front armour plates were badly damaged, and although the storm bolter was still operational, it would no longer turn fully through its right-hand arc. The brass pipes of the organ were a mess, and the company’s banner was in shreds – but these seemed the least of the canoness’ concerns. ‘Locations,’ she said. ‘Caia?’ ‘They’re on the rocks,’ Caia told her. ‘Two on the right, three on the left.’ She could see them – just – perched like predators, and silhouetted against the sky. ‘Extreme range.’ The canoness’ words were a statement, and rapidly followed by an order, ‘Immolators and Repressors, hold your locations. Exorcists, on my command.’ Wryly, Caia looked at the mess ahead of them. The various fallen machines had all but blocked the roadway – not Rayos’ original plan, perhaps, but effective nonetheless. But the canoness, it seemed, was unworried. ‘Sister Jolantra! Ready missiles.’ Sister Jolantra was the commander of the Exorcist unit that guarded the company’s rear. It also, Caia knew, had the range to strike. But, as the vox-coders began to broadcast again, the trumpet call that was the muster, the call to battle, the five waiting Ironstriders raised their autocannons at the company. And they opened fire.",

Its autocannon, however, had slumped forwards and ceased to fire. All three of the surviving machines were now closing on the standing lines of infantry. Before them, a red line across the black road, Sisters stood fearless and fast, still shooting, still singing, their close harmonics edged with focused rage. ‘That Thou wouldst bring them only death!’ Caia found herself echoing their words, repeating them over and over again – only death, only death – like a mantra. She had never seen a battle from a tank’s vantage, and she found her heart thumping hard in her chest. She wanted to be shooting, wanted to be on the ground. She wanted to be out there, amid the smoke and the noise and the slaughter; she wanted to stain her armour with the blood of her foe… She wanted to rage denial against this feared, final fate that was finally closing down upon her, the thing she’d dreaded since she’d been a wet-eared novitiate… I was called to be a warrior, and a warrior I will stay! As two of the three incoming machines opened fire, she saw one red-armoured figure fall, then another – but not her own squad, they were still on their feet. The smallest figure, Akemi, had stopped to change her magazine, the movement smooth as reflex. A second later, she was firing again, her bolter held hard in both hands, her aim true. Caia’s hands tightened on her auspex and bolter both… ‘That Thou shouldst pardon none!’ In front of her, the canoness shot again; she broadcast anger and defiance with her every sung note. In the belly of the tank, however, Rhene had stopped singing. She was muttering aloud, almost to herself, ‘Ironstriders. They’re sharpshooters, seen ’em before. On Melecantha. They ambushed us. So why are they running?’ Without thinking, Caia replied, ‘They’re trying to get behind us. There must be another wave!’ Ianthe barked, ‘Exorcists, on my command. Caia, watch that auspex!’ ‘Aye.’ Caia’s acknowledgement was echoed over the vox, and she lifted the auspex, watching. And it seemed her hunch had been right – the attacking machines weren’t slowing down. Two autocannons tracked round as they ran, and again, opened fire. One targeted the canoness. The other aimed straight for Sister Viola. On the ground, Augusta held her position, bolter and chain­sword in hand. She stood at the centre of her squad’s line, Mors on one side, Alcina on the other. Viola stood on the line’s inside, and Melia at its outermost edge – this was not a battle for flamers. Echoing the canoness’ thundered song, the Sister Superior’s voice reached a crescendo as Mors hit the servitor, but the machine was still running with its fellows, through the rising smoke and straight at them. In all the clouds of dirt, it took Augusta a split second to realise that the machine that had been hit was not firing. Without its pilot, it was simply following its last command, and, with His blessing, it would run straight off the edge of the road. She dismissed it, concentrating on the one closest. If that turning autocannon hit them, they would all be facing the Emperor. But Viola was still shooting, the booming clattering of the heavy bolter filling the filthy air. Shouting the words of the litany, she raised her aim as the thing came closer, shooting upwards and almost into its belly. It juddered under the bombardment, explosions opening like wounds all over its frame, but still, it kept coming. Its feet were big enough to crush Viola clean to the ground. Mors shot it again, his aim not as blessed, and his streak of fire went wide. Rufus was shouting something at him, though Augusta couldn’t hear. She said to Alcina, beside her, ‘Give me room.’ Alcina shot her a sharp look, but moved. As the thing readied itself to fire, the Sister Superior held her chainsword ready. To their right, the other running machines were keeping pace with their fellow. One was closing on the canoness’ Immolator, the other on the far flank. Augusta could only see them as a blur from the corner of her eye, but she knew what was coming. The running machines opened fire together, the autocannons seeming to shake the very sky. On the far flank, scarlet armour scattered, figures were thrown in the air like toys. In the centre, the machine chewed more holes in the roadway; the canoness’ Immolator rocked, but that was all. And in front of the squad… The autocannon was aimed at Viola, identifying the greatest threat. As it fired, its muzzle flaring with light, Viola hurled herself bodily backwards, still shooting. In front of her, the roadway became a series of craters, and steam and debris leapt into the air. Cursing, Viola rolled into a kneel. Still, she kept shooting. In the vox, the canoness: ‘Roku, right-hand machine, all bolters. Nikaya, right flank!’ Augusta heard the order, and understood that the Seraphim were moving to protect Eleni’s weakened squad, but the machine was almost on them now. She watched its foot rise, timed it as it came down, its impact shaking the road… Lashed out with the chainsword, straight at its ankle. The blade hit, bit, and got stuck. A second later the running foot raised once more, wrenching her shoulder and elbow and tearing the weapon from her grip. Grit scattered; she bit back a curse. She raised the bolter with the other hand, opened fire. Beside her, Alcina did the same. Rounds thundered; twin streaks of lasgun fire cut through the smoke. The combined shooting of the whole squad battered the thing as it ran through them, and closed on the Exorcists behind. And then, the damage was just too much. Its armour dented and blackened, its autocannon now blocked by its own body, it lurched and began to stagger. ‘It’s going to fall!’ The shout was Akemi, as the Ironstrider twitched, rocked, and then slowly toppled away from them. Augusta breathed a prayer of gratitude. As it fell, the crash was tremendous. Its servitor rolled free, but Melia was already there and a single flaming whoosh melted flesh and metal alike. A sickening, smoking smear was left on the roadway. Ash blew on the wind. Augusta went to retrieve her chainsword. With servitor and machine both down, she was already thinking about the rest of the battle. ‘Incoming!’ Caia cried the word aloud as five more contacts blipped on her auspex. ‘No – not incoming, they’ve stopped.’ The first wave of machines was down; the sheer, continuous onslaught of the combined bolter fire had just proved too much. Around the company, the roadway was devastation, pitted with craters, smeared by smoke and drifting with rising dirt. Four machines lay in ruins, their armour and pieces scattered. The fifth had simply run straight over the outermost curve of the roadway and vanished into the water. Not one of them had made it through the company to reach the other side – but the inflicted damage had been severe. At the right flank, Eleni’s squad had lost their Repressor, its driver, and two Sisters; a third was badly injured. Covered by the Seraphim, Eleni and her surviving squad-member had picked up the injured woman and had run for the canoness’ Immolator. Rhene, still grumbling, had lowered the ramp for long enough to let them embark, and then closed it again. Her muttering continued as she tended to the downed Sister. ‘Sister Roku.’ The canoness’ bark was unaffected by the damage. ‘Move outwards, defend the right flank. We’ll hold the centre.’ ‘Understood.’ On the left flank, Augusta’s squad was unhurt, but in the centre, the canon­ess’ vehicle had taken significant fire – its top and front armour plates were badly damaged, and although the storm bolter was still operational, it would no longer turn fully through its right-hand arc. The brass pipes of the organ were a mess, and the company’s banner was in shreds – but these seemed the least of the canoness’ concerns. ‘Locations,’ she said. ‘Caia?’ ‘They’re on the rocks,’ Caia told her. ‘Two on the right, three on the left.’ She could see them – just – perched like predators, and silhouetted against the sky. ‘Extreme range.’ The canoness’ words were a statement, and rapidly followed by an order, ‘Immolators and Repressors, hold your locations. Exorcists, on my command.’ Wryly, Caia looked at the mess ahead of them. The various fallen machines had all but blocked the roadway – not Rayos’ original plan, perhaps, but effective nonetheless. But the canoness, it seemed, was unworried. ‘Sister Jolantra! Ready missiles.’ Sister Jolantra was the commander of the Exorcist unit that guarded the company’s rear. It also, Caia knew, had the range to strike. But, as the vox-coders began to broadcast again, the trumpet call that was the muster, the call to battle, the five waiting Ironstriders raised their autocannons at the company. And they opened fire.",

      "content": "CHAPTER FIVE The Ironstriders had the range, the vantage, and a clear field of fire. The assembled Order had no cover. The canoness barked at Caia to duck, shoving both of them into the belly of the Immolator and slamming the hatch as the echoing boom of autocannons filled the air. Assailed by the noise, rocks cracked, rumbled and fell. They hit the roadway, splintering into fragments; the metal-flat water geysered with repeated impacts. On the right flank, Sister Roku’s squad had barely re-embarked before their Repressor was slammed with explosive incoming rounds. Roku was not intimidated. Her voice rang furious, singing the Dies Irae. On the left, Augusta and her squad were knocked to the floor of their vehicle, falling on top of one another as the thing lurched into motion through a thundering hail of fire. In the centre, Caia likewise hit the floor of the Immolator, nearly knocking Rhene to the ground. Kneeling over the injured Sister, Rhene snapped at her to watch herself and went back to her charge. The injured woman had caught a spray of shrapnel in her belly, and the wound was bleeding heavily. She made no sound, but her chestplate was off, and gore seeped out through her underarmour. It leaked, steaming, across the cold metal floor. Oblivious of the blood, Sister Superior Eleni knelt at the woman’s other side, gripping her gauntleted hand in both of her own. Her helm was off, and sweat matted her blonde hair. It slid down her skin, glittering, outlining the edges of her tattoo. She was praying for strength, for His light and mercy, and she was echoed by her squad’s only other survivor, who sat against the vehicle’s side, her flamer over her knees. Caia joined them, the prayer bringing a flare of anger. She felt almost guilty at the woman’s injury, felt that she should have done more, been out there to defend her. By the Throne, she didn’t want to be in here, hiding – she wanted to be fighting, firing, bringing wrath and retribution… Her nervousness was crystallising, becoming anger about its edges. Not only anger at the enemy, but anger at her situation. Questions plagued her, flickering like prayers. Was this because of Zale, the witch? Had he touched her, too, with his heresy? Were her squad really here to redeem themselves in death, like the two doomed soldiers? And if so, then why had she been separated? If they were to die, then surely, she should be with them! Or have I not proven myself worthy enough? Ianthe’s voice cut across her thoughts. ‘They have excellent aim,’ she said. ‘If they wanted to, they could take both of us, clean from the top of the vehicle.’ Raising her voice, she called out across the vox-coder: ‘Stand fast, my Sisters! His light is with us! We do not fear death! We do not fear pain! We will fight with the last round in every weapon, with the last breath in every body! For the Emperor!’ ‘The debris field is clearing. Full scan of the factorum in ninety solar seconds,’ Captain Mulier announced aboard the Kyrus. ‘Ninety seconds.’ The canoness muttered the words aloud. She had a grin like a blade, sharp and gleaming and utterly mirthless; one fist was clenched like she could take on the Ironstriders with her gauntlet alone. She snapped, ‘Exorcists! Fire!’ Caia couldn’t see the missiles as they streaked across the filthy brown sky, but she could hear the detonations as they hit. And she could imagine the machines rocking and falling, the explosive craters blown in the basalt, the debris and rock and metal and flesh as it was flung in every direction, the plumes of superheated smoke… She continued to pray with Sister Eleni, listening, and watching the auspex in her hand. The explosions were moving past them, backwards through the company. She heard her Sisters curse as the shells found their new targets, and fell upon the Exorcists. And then, from almost directly behind them, came the unmistake­able detonation of promethium fuel. A brief scream sounded in the vox, half-shriek, half-prayer. Livid with fury, the canoness’ voice grew louder, thunderous and proud. Caia, too, prayed like a woman demented. ‘We beseech Thee!’ On her feet, her pistol still in her hand, Ianthe barked, ‘Reload! Again!’ A rumble of rubble seemed to shake the roadway. Sister Jolantra, in the leading Exorcist, remarked, ‘One down!’ Then paused. ‘Two!’ Another pause, letting the music fill the almost breathless wait. ‘And by His grace – another one crushed by the rocks. Three!’ The canoness’ grin grew. Caia kept praying, feeling the words surge in her blood; Ianthe was looking up at the hatch as though she would leap out of it, descending on the machines with weapon in hand and the wrath of the Saint herself… The heavy boom of the remaining autocannons continued, now focused exclusively on the Exorcists as the greatest threat. A third volley of missiles arced over their heads, and Sister Jolantra snarled, ‘Four!’ Briefly, the last autocannon rattled on alone. There was a rumble of falling rocks, and it fell silent. ‘Five!’ Jolantra’s voice rose in a shout, a savage paean of victory and thanks. The gunfire had stopped, and the grumble of the Immolator’s engine seemed suddenly loud. Caia stood up, but Ianthe was already moving, opening the hatch above her head and scrambling up to look out at the battle. Captain Mulier said, ‘Scan in twenty seconds… Nineteen…’ ‘The roadway looks clear. Sister Caia?’ the canoness asked. ‘Nothing moving,’ Caia said. She jumped up, and looked round to assess the damage. ‘By His light!’ The words were a breath. Sister Caia was no neophyte. She and Melia had served together as novitiates, and they had taken their Oath of Ordination at the same time. They had joined Augusta’s squad ten years before, had seen the savage death-green glow of the necrons at Psamitek, and the clicking seethe of massed tyranids, their rip and claw and hunger. They’d seen the graceful fury of the aeldari on Basilissica, the muscle and mockery of the orks on Lautis. They’d faced the slaver of daemons, their whips and teeth and laughter; they’d seen the roil and flare of the very warp itself… But Caia had never been to war alongside her assembled Order, never seen her Sisters dying in numbers, nor such devastation as Rayos’ machines could inflict… She steadied herself on the edge of the hatch. ‘We are strong, Sister,’ Ianthe said. ‘He is with us. Can you not feel His anger? Taste it in the smoke on the air? Understand His joy and wrath in the exaltation of pure combat?’ The canoness’ voice was like a plucked string, deep and strong and vibrant, and laden with blood and power. The vox-coder broadcast, ‘Sisters! We claim victory in the name of the God-Emperor! We will not let these defiled machines stand in our way!’ The ruined banner at her back, Caia answered, along with her Sisters, ‘Ave Imperator!’ The shout carried skywards, its force almost enough to make a whorl of currents in the floating dirt. The roadway, however, was a jumble of confusion. Amid the drifting smoke, Caia could see the devastation – the pieces of red armour, the strewn fragments of the downed Ironstriders. The damage to the ferrocrete road was severe, pockmarks and craters marking where multiple rockfalls had tumbled after the Exorcists’ missiles had hit. Sister Jolantra, it seemed, had been targeting the overhanging stone as much as the attackers themselves. Mikaela’s Immolator was already rumbling over the top of the mess, crushing all beneath the vehicle’s relentless tracks. Caia checked her auspex, but there was nothing else in motion. Captain Mulier barked. ‘Five… Four… Three…’ She breathed a prayer… ‘And clear,’ Mulier said. ‘As far as I can tell, milady, the factorum is empty.’ ‘The Ironstriders must have waited, and then run out to meet us,’ Ianthe answered grimly. ‘But, as the Treatise says, He defends those best who defend themselves… We will pause to make sure.’ Augusta’s orders were clear – the vehicles would secure and hold the junction, and she and her squad were to disembark and scout the empty factorum on foot. They were not to engage, they were just to observe and report. If there were any threat remaining, they would ensure its final destruction. As the Order closed the gap upon its mission target, nothing could be left at its back. ‘Understood.’ In the back of their Repressor, Augusta relayed the new orders to her squad, and to the two waiting soldiers. Viola pulled a face, thought better of it, and stayed quiet. ‘We move in three solar minutes,’ Augusta said, shooting a warning look at the red-haired Sister. ‘Aye,’ Viola replied. The Sister Superior was very aware of Sister Alcina, standing with her arms folded and her expression flat. Alcina had not been impressed by Augusta’s attempt to take down the Ironstrider by striking at its foot, though she was disciplined enough to say nothing. Augusta had the uncomfortable sensation, however, that Alcina was still watching her. Watching all of them. ‘Sister?’ she asked. The Repressor jerked untidily sideways as it crushed rock and machine beneath its progress. Augusta caught at the roof to keep her feet. From the front, Sister Cindal called, ‘Auspex still clear, advancing on target. Ramp will drop in two minutes.’ Alcina said, ‘I will speak to you privately, Sister. When we have a moment. The enemy is our first priority.’ Augusta gave her a long, steady look, but offered no further response – this was a combat situation, and not the time. When Alcina finally dropped her gaze, the Sister Superior nodded, then said, ‘Viola and Rhea, take point. Melia, take rear. Mors, with me. Rufus, with Sister Akemi. We will enter by the side access and follow the left-hand wall, staying under cover of the balcony and the empty hoppers. If anything moves, we observe and report, and we await further orders.’ The Repressor’s engines slowed, and the vehicle came to a stop. Cindal said, ‘Still nothing, Sisters. Twenty seconds ’til I drop the ramp.’ ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘May His light follow us into the darkness. May His wisdom watch our pathway.’ Cindal said, ‘Three seconds, Sisters.’ The ramp’s green light flashed, its hydraulics whined. And even before it hit the ground, Viola and Rhea were moving, their cohesion smooth and easy. But a new problem had developed. The factorum’s concourse was gritty with black ash and fine, metallic sand. In the aftermath of the battle, it had been stirred to wakefulness by the ripples of rising heat, obscuring the Sisters’ preysight and limiting their field of vision. Viola reached the bottom of the ramp with a curse, and dropped to a kneel, her heavy bolter aimed out across the factorum’s foreground – what she could see of it. Rhea followed the motion, letting Viola run forwards once more. Their deployment was faultless, a movement completed a thousand times. ‘Can’t see a damned thing.’ The curse was Rufus. ‘Could be anything moving in all this!’ Augusta barked, ‘Suit-lights!’ Six beams of light glimmered through the billowing dirt as the squad followed, weapons in hands. Atop the Repressor, the storm bolter was tracking, covering them, but there was nothing to see. Augusta said, ‘Sister Rhea?’ Her long form like a bloodied smear, Rhea returned, ‘Nothing, Sister Superior. No motion.’ ‘Keep scanning,’ Augusta said. Six Sisters and two soldiers moved swiftly – five paces, and kneel, five paces, and kneel. Dependent completely upon Rhea and her auspex, they moved towards the left-hand side of the building, their suit-lights picking out the glimmers of mica and obsidian, buried in the rock, the twin gleam of the servohauler rails. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. The building loomed high, identical in shape to the previous factorum, the one in which they’d caught Scafidis Zale. This time, however, it lacked the attaching metal walkways, and its left-hand side was butted up hard against the rock. The area provided a lee of shelter, and as they came closer, their vision cleared and they could make out the door that Augusta had meant. It bore a line of binary numerals and a cog-and-skull symbol that they’d seen before. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi said. The word seemed heavy, its syllables like rocks, rolling onwards through the dust. ‘Rayos’ home forge world,’ Augusta commented. ‘She must have known all this was here,’ Melia said. ‘Why else did she come to this planet?’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta responded. ‘Many of these machine-parts must be centuries old.’ They moved onwards, and saw that the servohauler tracks ended at a huge and echoing depot, empty and dug backwards into the cold rock wall. ‘She must have worked hard, to rebuild this army.’ ‘We estimate that Rayos has been here for maybe two decades,’ Akemi said. ‘I do not clearly understand the ways of machine-spirits, but she must have worked hard indeed to build this many machines in that short a time.’ The air in the depot was still; there were no engines, nothing. The lines of tracks gleamed in mockery and an odd chill went down the Sister Superior’s spine. This many machines… It was a glint of suspicion like the tip of a blade, caught in a poorly healed wound… That short a time. But the depot offered no answers. At Augusta’s order, Viola and Rhea reached the door to the factorum, and stopped. Unlike the various heavy double doors that allowed the machines themselves into and out of the building, this one was normal size – for servitors, helots and tech-priests. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. ‘If the Kyrus’ scans are correct, this factorum was emptied more than two weeks ago.’ Sister Alcina muttered in the vox, ‘I dislike this, Sister.’ ‘I hear you,’ Augusta agreed. Then, ‘Quietly if you can, Sisters. The Emperor rewards caution.’ Carefully, Rhea reached out. The door didn’t move. She tried again, then stepped back, and, with little effort, struck it with one red boot. It sprang open, slamming backwards, and Viola was already through it, her heavy bolter and suit-light covering the space inside. But there was nothing there. Nothing moved. Nothing opened fire. No lights glared, no sirens wailed… ‘Of course,’ Augusta commented, straight-faced, ‘He also rewards audacity.’ Muttering the words of the litany, she gave the order to advance. The factorum was empty. The space was huge, covered in the dust of centuries. And yet that dust had been tracked with recent movements and shifted into patterns – there had been something here, and not very long ago. The squad spread out in twos, taking Rufus with them. Augusta kept Mors at her shoulder – the young ex-corporal had more experience of this planet than any of the Sisters, and might offer insight where they could not. Confronted with the deserted expanse of the factorum floor, however, he shook his head. ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ he said. ‘I can only offer what we already know. Rayos has removed her force from this location.’ He paused, then added, ‘Permission to speak freely?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘Sister, her force is fully assembled. I fear… I feel that we are wasting our time. We should strive to reach our target before Rayos’ force can be moved off-world.’ ‘Aye.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘But the Kyrus will warn us if anything else enters orbit above the platform.’ Mors did not argue. ‘Yes, Sister.’ They went back to pacing the vast and empty space, trying to piece together the movements from the marks in the dust – but it was almost impossible. The exploring Sisters answered their roll calls, one pair after another. They, too, were finding nothing. At last, Augusta and Mors came to a stop before the one point in the factorum that had really caught their interest. A shrine. A Mechanicus shrine, clearly the factorum’s main place of worship – to Augusta it looked more like a miniature workshop, a place of pict-screens and pipes and furnaces and maintenance. Binary prayers were embossed in its metal walls and, under them, there were other marks that were clearly machine dialect, something that she could not read. She called for Akemi, and continued to look. The area was clean, clear of the ever-present metallic dust; it had recent oil stains where machines had been assembled or repaired. It also bore a cog-and-skull, one that they were starting to find familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Augusta said. ‘Again.’ She stood looking at it, and then realised something else. ‘This one is more recent than the mark on the door.’ ‘By some considerable time.’ Mors ventured an agreement, his hands gripped round his lasrifle, the weapon tucked hard into his shoulder. He was watching the empty factorum, as if convinced that they’d missed something. ‘Am I correct in recalling, Mors,’ Augusta said, ‘that Rayos had scarred over the mark of her home world?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ he said. ‘I recall the same thing.’ ‘She is a heretek. She has abandoned her world, denied it. So why would she make its mark in her workshop?’ He blinked. ‘I do not know.’ Augusta said nothing, and continued to examine the shrine. There was little else to see – a small stacked data-bank, a forgotten cogitator, a hanging line of basic tools and attachments, all of them clean and recently used. Akemi arrived at a run, Rufus with her. The young medicae had caught a shrapnel-cut across the side of his face, and the field-dressing seeped with red. ‘Sister Superior?’ Augusta pointed a red-armoured finger. ‘The machine dialect, Sister Akemi, what does it say?’ Akemi had almost taken her Oath of Ordination to the Order of the Quill, and her linguistic skills were formidable. Machine dialect, however, was a difficult task for a human, no matter how good their education. She said, ‘I fear I can read very little of it, Sister–’ ‘Try.’ Augusta’s word was an order. Akemi turned her suit-light on the text, and frowned. After a moment, she said, ‘Toll the great bell… Sing praise… the God of all… It’s a prayer for maintenance, for the reconstruction and accession of broken machine-spirits…’ She paused, then said, ‘No – not reconstruction. Creation.’ She started to explain the difference in phraseology, but Augusta stopped her with a raised hand, and she finished, ‘This is a birth-prayer.’ ‘A birth-prayer?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘This shrine was not created by this world’s original tech-priests. It’s a place for remaking, for joining parts of a spirit to make a new whole.’ She paused. ‘I do not know if this is heresy.’ ‘That surely depends on the parts,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak – though she, too, did not understand enough of the ways of the Omnissiah, nor of the heretek. Akemi had confirmed her suspicion, however, acknow­ledged that blade-spike of aggravation that was biting into her thoughts… ‘There is something else here,’ she said. ‘And I am beginning to suspect that it, too, once came from Incaladion.’",

The canoness barked at Caia to duck, shoving both of them into the belly of the Immolator and slamming the hatch as the echoing boom of autocannons filled the air. Assailed by the noise, rocks cracked, rumbled and fell. They hit the roadway, splintering into fragments; the metal-flat water geysered with repeated impacts. On the right flank, Sister Roku’s squad had barely re-embarked before their Repressor was slammed with explosive incoming rounds. Roku was not intimidated. Her voice rang furious, singing the Dies Irae. On the left, Augusta and her squad were knocked to the floor of their vehicle, falling on top of one another as the thing lurched into motion through a thundering hail of fire. In the centre, Caia likewise hit the floor of the Immolator, nearly knocking Rhene to the ground. Kneeling over the injured Sister, Rhene snapped at her to watch herself and went back to her charge. The injured woman had caught a spray of shrapnel in her belly, and the wound was bleeding heavily. She made no sound, but her chestplate was off, and gore seeped out through her underarmour. It leaked, steaming, across the cold metal floor. Oblivious of the blood, Sister Superior Eleni knelt at the woman’s other side, gripping her gauntleted hand in both of her own. Her helm was off, and sweat matted her blonde hair. It slid down her skin, glittering, outlining the edges of her tattoo. She was praying for strength, for His light and mercy, and she was echoed by her squad’s only other survivor, who sat against the vehicle’s side, her flamer over her knees. Caia joined them, the prayer bringing a flare of anger. She felt almost guilty at the woman’s injury, felt that she should have done more, been out there to defend her. By the Throne, she didn’t want to be in here, hiding – she wanted to be fighting, firing, bringing wrath and retribution… Her nervousness was crystallising, becoming anger about its edges. Not only anger at the enemy, but anger at her situation. Questions plagued her, flickering like prayers. Was this because of Zale, the witch? Had he touched her, too, with his heresy? Were her squad really here to redeem themselves in death, like the two doomed soldiers? And if so, then why had she been separated? If they were to die, then surely, she should be with them! Or have I not proven myself worthy enough? Ianthe’s voice cut across her thoughts. ‘They have excellent aim,’ she said. ‘If they wanted to, they could take both of us, clean from the top of the vehicle.’ Raising her voice, she called out across the vox-coder: ‘Stand fast, my Sisters! His light is with us! We do not fear death! We do not fear pain! We will fight with the last round in every weapon, with the last breath in every body! For the Emperor!’ ‘The debris field is clearing. Full scan of the factorum in ninety solar seconds,’ Captain Mulier announced aboard the Kyrus. ‘Ninety seconds.’ The canoness muttered the words aloud. She had a grin like a blade, sharp and gleaming and utterly mirthless; one fist was clenched like she could take on the Ironstriders with her gauntlet alone. She snapped, ‘Exorcists! Fire!’ Caia couldn’t see the missiles as they streaked across the filthy brown sky, but she could hear the detonations as they hit. And she could imagine the machines rocking and falling, the explosive craters blown in the basalt, the debris and rock and metal and flesh as it was flung in every direction, the plumes of superheated smoke… She continued to pray with Sister Eleni, listening, and watching the auspex in her hand. The explosions were moving past them, backwards through the company. She heard her Sisters curse as the shells found their new targets, and fell upon the Exorcists. And then, from almost directly behind them, came the unmistake­able detonation of promethium fuel. A brief scream sounded in the vox, half-shriek, half-prayer. Livid with fury, the canoness’ voice grew louder, thunderous and proud. Caia, too, prayed like a woman demented. ‘We beseech Thee!’ On her feet, her pistol still in her hand, Ianthe barked, ‘Reload! Again!’ A rumble of rubble seemed to shake the roadway. Sister Jolantra, in the leading Exorcist, remarked, ‘One down!’ Then paused. ‘Two!’ Another pause, letting the music fill the almost breathless wait. ‘And by His grace – another one crushed by the rocks. Three!’ The canoness’ grin grew. Caia kept praying, feeling the words surge in her blood; Ianthe was looking up at the hatch as though she would leap out of it, descending on the machines with weapon in hand and the wrath of the Saint herself… The heavy boom of the remaining autocannons continued, now focused exclusively on the Exorcists as the greatest threat. A third volley of missiles arced over their heads, and Sister Jolantra snarled, ‘Four!’ Briefly, the last autocannon rattled on alone. There was a rumble of falling rocks, and it fell silent. ‘Five!’ Jolantra’s voice rose in a shout, a savage paean of victory and thanks. The gunfire had stopped, and the grumble of the Immolator’s engine seemed suddenly loud. Caia stood up, but Ianthe was already moving, opening the hatch above her head and scrambling up to look out at the battle. Captain Mulier said, ‘Scan in twenty seconds… Nineteen…’ ‘The roadway looks clear. Sister Caia?’ the canoness asked. ‘Nothing moving,’ Caia said. She jumped up, and looked round to assess the damage. ‘By His light!’ The words were a breath. Sister Caia was no neophyte. She and Melia had served together as novitiates, and they had taken their Oath of Ordination at the same time. They had joined Augusta’s squad ten years before, had seen the savage death-green glow of the necrons at Psamitek, and the clicking seethe of massed tyranids, their rip and claw and hunger. They’d seen the graceful fury of the aeldari on Basilissica, the muscle and mockery of the orks on Lautis. They’d faced the slaver of daemons, their whips and teeth and laughter; they’d seen the roil and flare of the very warp itself… But Caia had never been to war alongside her assembled Order, never seen her Sisters dying in numbers, nor such devastation as Rayos’ machines could inflict… She steadied herself on the edge of the hatch. ‘We are strong, Sister,’ Ianthe said. ‘He is with us. Can you not feel His anger? Taste it in the smoke on the air? Understand His joy and wrath in the exaltation of pure combat?’ The canoness’ voice was like a plucked string, deep and strong and vibrant, and laden with blood and power. The vox-coder broadcast, ‘Sisters! We claim victory in the name of the God-Emperor! We will not let these defiled machines stand in our way!’ The ruined banner at her back, Caia answered, along with her Sisters, ‘Ave Imperator!’ The shout carried skywards, its force almost enough to make a whorl of currents in the floating dirt. The roadway, however, was a jumble of confusion. Amid the drifting smoke, Caia could see the devastation – the pieces of red armour, the strewn fragments of the downed Ironstriders. The damage to the ferrocrete road was severe, pockmarks and craters marking where multiple rockfalls had tumbled after the Exorcists’ missiles had hit. Sister Jolantra, it seemed, had been targeting the overhanging stone as much as the attackers themselves. Mikaela’s Immolator was already rumbling over the top of the mess, crushing all beneath the vehicle’s relentless tracks. Caia checked her auspex, but there was nothing else in motion. Captain Mulier barked. ‘Five… Four… Three…’ She breathed a prayer… ‘And clear,’ Mulier said. ‘As far as I can tell, milady, the factorum is empty.’ ‘The Ironstriders must have waited, and then run out to meet us,’ Ianthe answered grimly. ‘But, as the Treatise says, He defends those best who defend themselves… We will pause to make sure.’ Augusta’s orders were clear – the vehicles would secure and hold the junction, and she and her squad were to disembark and scout the empty factorum on foot. They were not to engage, they were just to observe and report. If there were any threat remaining, they would ensure its final destruction. As the Order closed the gap upon its mission target, nothing could be left at its back. ‘Understood.’ In the back of their Repressor, Augusta relayed the new orders to her squad, and to the two waiting soldiers. Viola pulled a face, thought better of it, and stayed quiet. ‘We move in three solar minutes,’ Augusta said, shooting a warning look at the red-haired Sister. ‘Aye,’ Viola replied. The Sister Superior was very aware of Sister Alcina, standing with her arms folded and her expression flat. Alcina had not been impressed by Augusta’s attempt to take down the Ironstrider by striking at its foot, though she was disciplined enough to say nothing. Augusta had the uncomfortable sensation, however, that Alcina was still watching her. Watching all of them. ‘Sister?’ she asked. The Repressor jerked untidily sideways as it crushed rock and machine beneath its progress. Augusta caught at the roof to keep her feet. From the front, Sister Cindal called, ‘Auspex still clear, advancing on target. Ramp will drop in two minutes.’ Alcina said, ‘I will speak to you privately, Sister. When we have a moment. The enemy is our first priority.’ Augusta gave her a long, steady look, but offered no further response – this was a combat situation, and not the time. When Alcina finally dropped her gaze, the Sister Superior nodded, then said, ‘Viola and Rhea, take point. Melia, take rear. Mors, with me. Rufus, with Sister Akemi. We will enter by the side access and follow the left-hand wall, staying under cover of the balcony and the empty hoppers. If anything moves, we observe and report, and we await further orders.’ The Repressor’s engines slowed, and the vehicle came to a stop. Cindal said, ‘Still nothing, Sisters. Twenty seconds ’til I drop the ramp.’ ‘Helmets on,’ Augusta said. ‘May His light follow us into the darkness. May His wisdom watch our pathway.’ Cindal said, ‘Three seconds, Sisters.’ The ramp’s green light flashed, its hydraulics whined. And even before it hit the ground, Viola and Rhea were moving, their cohesion smooth and easy. But a new problem had developed. The factorum’s concourse was gritty with black ash and fine, metallic sand. In the aftermath of the battle, it had been stirred to wakefulness by the ripples of rising heat, obscuring the Sisters’ preysight and limiting their field of vision. Viola reached the bottom of the ramp with a curse, and dropped to a kneel, her heavy bolter aimed out across the factorum’s foreground – what she could see of it. Rhea followed the motion, letting Viola run forwards once more. Their deployment was faultless, a movement completed a thousand times. ‘Can’t see a damned thing.’ The curse was Rufus. ‘Could be anything moving in all this!’ Augusta barked, ‘Suit-lights!’ Six beams of light glimmered through the billowing dirt as the squad followed, weapons in hands. Atop the Repressor, the storm bolter was tracking, covering them, but there was nothing to see. Augusta said, ‘Sister Rhea?’ Her long form like a bloodied smear, Rhea returned, ‘Nothing, Sister Superior. No motion.’ ‘Keep scanning,’ Augusta said. Six Sisters and two soldiers moved swiftly – five paces, and kneel, five paces, and kneel. Dependent completely upon Rhea and her auspex, they moved towards the left-hand side of the building, their suit-lights picking out the glimmers of mica and obsidian, buried in the rock, the twin gleam of the servohauler rails. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. The building loomed high, identical in shape to the previous factorum, the one in which they’d caught Scafidis Zale. This time, however, it lacked the attaching metal walkways, and its left-hand side was butted up hard against the rock. The area provided a lee of shelter, and as they came closer, their vision cleared and they could make out the door that Augusta had meant. It bore a line of binary numerals and a cog-and-skull symbol that they’d seen before. ‘Incaladion,’ Akemi said. The word seemed heavy, its syllables like rocks, rolling onwards through the dust. ‘Rayos’ home forge world,’ Augusta commented. ‘She must have known all this was here,’ Melia said. ‘Why else did she come to this planet?’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta responded. ‘Many of these machine-parts must be centuries old.’ They moved onwards, and saw that the servohauler tracks ended at a huge and echoing depot, empty and dug backwards into the cold rock wall. ‘She must have worked hard, to rebuild this army.’ ‘We estimate that Rayos has been here for maybe two decades,’ Akemi said. ‘I do not clearly understand the ways of machine-spirits, but she must have worked hard indeed to build this many machines in that short a time.’ The air in the depot was still; there were no engines, nothing. The lines of tracks gleamed in mockery and an odd chill went down the Sister Superior’s spine. This many machines… It was a glint of suspicion like the tip of a blade, caught in a poorly healed wound… That short a time. But the depot offered no answers. At Augusta’s order, Viola and Rhea reached the door to the factorum, and stopped. Unlike the various heavy double doors that allowed the machines themselves into and out of the building, this one was normal size – for servitors, helots and tech-priests. ‘Still nothing,’ Rhea said. ‘If the Kyrus’ scans are correct, this factorum was emptied more than two weeks ago.’ Sister Alcina muttered in the vox, ‘I dislike this, Sister.’ ‘I hear you,’ Augusta agreed. Then, ‘Quietly if you can, Sisters. The Emperor rewards caution.’ Carefully, Rhea reached out. The door didn’t move. She tried again, then stepped back, and, with little effort, struck it with one red boot. It sprang open, slamming backwards, and Viola was already through it, her heavy bolter and suit-light covering the space inside. But there was nothing there. Nothing moved. Nothing opened fire. No lights glared, no sirens wailed… ‘Of course,’ Augusta commented, straight-faced, ‘He also rewards audacity.’ Muttering the words of the litany, she gave the order to advance. The factorum was empty. The space was huge, covered in the dust of centuries. And yet that dust had been tracked with recent movements and shifted into patterns – there had been something here, and not very long ago. The squad spread out in twos, taking Rufus with them. Augusta kept Mors at her shoulder – the young ex-corporal had more experience of this planet than any of the Sisters, and might offer insight where they could not. Confronted with the deserted expanse of the factorum floor, however, he shook his head. ‘I’m sorry, Sister,’ he said. ‘I can only offer what we already know. Rayos has removed her force from this location.’ He paused, then added, ‘Permission to speak freely?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘Sister, her force is fully assembled. I fear… I feel that we are wasting our time. We should strive to reach our target before Rayos’ force can be moved off-world.’ ‘Aye.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘But the Kyrus will warn us if anything else enters orbit above the platform.’ Mors did not argue. ‘Yes, Sister.’ They went back to pacing the vast and empty space, trying to piece together the movements from the marks in the dust – but it was almost impossible. The exploring Sisters answered their roll calls, one pair after another. They, too, were finding nothing. At last, Augusta and Mors came to a stop before the one point in the factorum that had really caught their interest. A shrine. A Mechanicus shrine, clearly the factorum’s main place of worship – to Augusta it looked more like a miniature workshop, a place of pict-screens and pipes and furnaces and maintenance. Binary prayers were embossed in its metal walls and, under them, there were other marks that were clearly machine dialect, something that she could not read. She called for Akemi, and continued to look. The area was clean, clear of the ever-present metallic dust; it had recent oil stains where machines had been assembled or repaired. It also bore a cog-and-skull, one that they were starting to find familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Augusta said. ‘Again.’ She stood looking at it, and then realised something else. ‘This one is more recent than the mark on the door.’ ‘By some considerable time.’ Mors ventured an agreement, his hands gripped round his lasrifle, the weapon tucked hard into his shoulder. He was watching the empty factorum, as if convinced that they’d missed something. ‘Am I correct in recalling, Mors,’ Augusta said, ‘that Rayos had scarred over the mark of her home world?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ he said. ‘I recall the same thing.’ ‘She is a heretek. She has abandoned her world, denied it. So why would she make its mark in her workshop?’ He blinked. ‘I do not know.’ Augusta said nothing, and continued to examine the shrine. There was little else to see – a small stacked data-bank, a forgotten cogitator, a hanging line of basic tools and attachments, all of them clean and recently used. Akemi arrived at a run, Rufus with her. The young medicae had caught a shrapnel-cut across the side of his face, and the field-dressing seeped with red. ‘Sister Superior?’ Augusta pointed a red-armoured finger. ‘The machine dialect, Sister Akemi, what does it say?’ Akemi had almost taken her Oath of Ordination to the Order of the Quill, and her linguistic skills were formidable. Machine dialect, however, was a difficult task for a human, no matter how good their education. She said, ‘I fear I can read very little of it, Sister–’ ‘Try.’ Augusta’s word was an order. Akemi turned her suit-light on the text, and frowned. After a moment, she said, ‘Toll the great bell… Sing praise… the God of all… It’s a prayer for maintenance, for the reconstruction and accession of broken machine-spirits…’ She paused, then said, ‘No – not reconstruction. Creation.’ She started to explain the difference in phraseology, but Augusta stopped her with a raised hand, and she finished, ‘This is a birth-prayer.’ ‘A birth-prayer?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘This shrine was not created by this world’s original tech-priests. It’s a place for remaking, for joining parts of a spirit to make a new whole.’ She paused. ‘I do not know if this is heresy.’ ‘That surely depends on the parts,’ Augusta said, her tone bleak – though she, too, did not understand enough of the ways of the Omnissiah, nor of the heretek. Akemi had confirmed her suspicion, however, acknow­ledged that blade-spike of aggravation that was biting into her thoughts… ‘There is something else here,’ she said. ‘And I am beginning to suspect that it, too, once came from Incaladion.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER SIX With the factorum declared secure, the canoness called muster. Leaving two of the Exorcists to watch the road, the company moved to take advantage of the empty depot. The vehicles turned around, the manoeuvre smooth and practised, and then halted, their engines still running. Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim paused to refuel, and then moved from squad to squad, assessing their damage and speaking to each Sister Superior in turn. And, as they did so, Ianthe addressed them all from the top of her Immolator, the stone roof making the vox-coder echo like thunder. ‘My Sisters! This road is bleak and long, but with His blessing, we have come far! The God-Emperor strides at our side, and the corrupted machines cannot stop us! We bring wrath, and fire! We bring the light of Holy Terra to the darkness that is Lycheate! Stand fast, my Sisters, and walk tall!’ She paused, looking round at the waiting tanks. ‘The heretek Rayos has tested our mettle, and she will test us again. We may face another ambush, or mines along the roadway. And if, by the Emperor’s grace, we reach the citadel without mishap, then we will still face a considerable assembled force. Captain Mulier, aboard the Kyrus, is watching the roadway with orbital eyes, and we will be ready for any eventuality!’ She paused, and Caia looked out at the red ranks of vehicles – two now missing where the Ironstriders had struck, many more showing the char-marks and buckled plates of the autocannons’ impacts. The canoness went on, ‘Thanks to the wisdom of Sister Superior Augusta, we also now believe that Rayos is not working alone – she is likely to be working for, or with, an older power, possibly another Incaladion heretek.’ Another pause, but the only response was engine noise – vehicles snarling with the eagerness to be off. ‘We will identify and execute both Rayos and her collaborator. ‘Show courage, my Sisters! Unfurl your faith like a banner and carry it high in the wind!’ Ianthe spread her arms and turned to take in all of them, as if she led and offered courage to each Sister, to each vehicle, individually. ‘We carry the heart and the torch of the Order of the Bloody Rose! We carry the courage of Mina herself. We carry the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. We carry His name, and His glory, and we know no fear! Ave Imperator!’ In response, the Sisters gave a single, thundered, ‘Ave Imperator!’ Echoing the salute, Sister Nikaya gave the Repressor a stern nod as she passed – her personal check of each squad had been completed. The information, Caia guessed, would be communicated over a tight-beam link to the canoness alone. Vox-coder trumpets blared, and Ianthe blazed, ‘Forward!’ The engines rumbled their anger, and the company rolled onwards once more. Caia stood in the cupola, her auspex in her hand. Leaving the junction and the empty factorum behind them, the ranks of the Order, still in formation, drove out along the curving black road. The enemy knew that they were coming, and the Sisters raged their defiance. They broadcast the Dies Irae like a dare. Quantus tremor est futurus! The vehicles kept a strong but steady speed, the lead vehicle’s auspex constantly scanning the roadway ahead. There were fewer islands now, just a scattering of upthrust rocks, and the road itself hung over the limitless foul waters like some vast and endless bridge, a long line of industry and achievement that led onwards to the distant horizon. The Seraphim returned to their jump-pattern, and the hard chant of the hymn was a known thing – it rang out with wrath, solid and reassuring. To Caia, it felt powerful, lifting her chin and her heart and reminding her that, no matter how huge the acid sea, His presence travelled with them, in word, in deed, and in weapon. Their enemy awaited them, and they would not fail. As they rolled onwards, however, they began to encounter a new difficulty. Following another of its impulsive mood swings, the planet’s weather was deteriorating. The fat Lycheate sun had struggled its way to past mid-morning, and now the roiling brown cloud was rolling back in to smother its light. Corrosive, glutinous rain was beginning to scatter across tank and roadway alike. And where it struck, it hissed. Defended by their armour, both the canoness and Sister Caia remained standing in the back of the Immolator, the banner behind them now hanging in soggy tatters. Steadily, the rainwater ate at the fabric. Below them, in the belly of the vehicle, the injured Sister was sitting up and away from the hatch – and stridently declaring her fitness. ‘I can sit unassisted, thank you, Sister Hospitaller. Where is my weapon?’ Caia could hear Rhene grumbling, ‘You young women, never think to duck. What do they teach you in the schola? The Emperor is all-seeing, Sister Abril, but even He won’t stop an autocannon if it hits you square in the chest. How does that Treatise of yours go?’ The muttering continued, and Caia, startled by the old Hospitaller’s near-blasphemy, was even more surprised to see Ianthe turn and almost smile. Catching Caia’s expression, the canoness elegantly smoothed her own. She said, without apology, ‘Rhene deserves your respect, Sister. There are few, even within our own Order, who have seen the wars, and the deaths, and the horrors, witnessed by Sister Rhene. She may bear no armour, but she is fully combat-trained – and her bolter has slain many a slavering foe, even as she has saved the lives of the Sisters in her charge. Trust in her faith, and her knowledge, and her sanguinator.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Caia said nothing further. For any Sister to have reached the age of the grumbling Hospitaller, and still be in the field of combat rather than teaching at the schola… it deserved veneration. And Rhene, Caia was learning, saw a great deal more than she voiced. Briefly, she thought about asking the old Hospitaller if she knew more about Caia’s own situation – what the canoness had planned for her. She considered the option, then, reluctantly, dismissed it. Much as Caia suspected an old friendship between the two women, her inquiry would be improper. Frustrated, she looked back out across the endless rain-spattered water, and continued to pray. Slowly, the hour climbed towards midday. They had covered over two-thirds of the waiting roadway, almost a hundred and fifty miles from their original muster-point… Yet still, nothing had been laid in their path. As the noontide chimes began, and the canoness broadcast the prayer for the Hour, Caia found herself becoming increasingly suspicious. She, and the others in the Immolator, recited their responses, and yet she kept one eye on the auspex, compelled and wary – almost as if Rayos could reach out to corrupt its spirit, and it would feed them false information. But the Hour’s prayers were completed without mishap, and the rain grew heavier still, limiting their visibility to barely five yards in front of the still-moving vehicles. The crumbled parts of the roadway were beginning to flood, now, and the tanks were forced to slow, navigating the puddles carefully, and washing up a great wall of water to either side. After another hour, Caia began to realise that the horizon was changing. Somewhere, out through the rain, she could make out a shadow – a wide and rising blur, like the base of some vast and jagged cone. ‘Witness the citadel,’ the canoness told her. ‘Our target – and our enemy – lie ahead. We must take extreme care, in this poor visibility. If we can see them…’ Caia, reflexively, recited one of the schola’s earliest combat lessons, ‘…then they can also see us.’ ‘Just so.’ Ianthe, her words thoughtful, made no further comment. She began to pray, not the familiar rhythm of the day’s Hours, or the bugled wrath of the Dies Irae, but something darker, low and soft, a rumble like a bared threat. It was the words of the Reflections ex Testamento Eius, one of the Order’s oldest and most sacred texts, and it felt like the sliding strop of a whetstone. Listening to it made the hairs on Caia’s arms stand on end, as if He stood close, right over her, watching her every breath, her every movement. Caia found herself anticipating the coming battle with a shudder that felt like eagerness. She was a warrior born, and she would not have this taken away, not for all the wealth in the world. And certainly not for a long robe, and a set of false and affected manners… Spare me, she prayed. Let me serve You with fist and bolter, as I have always done. They rolled on. The glutinous rain grew heavier still, driving sideways across a rising wind. It lashed at the waters at the edge of the endlessly long road, driving them to froth and anger. It covered the tanks in spray, and occasionally in things less pleasant. The clouds grew thicker, and lower, and soon, the island was lost. But they still knew it lay ahead of them. Waiting, in the gloom. The first tank-tread triggered the detonation. There was no warning; the air filled with force and noise and smoke and the whistle of flying fragments. Startled, Caia bit back a curse. The noise was followed by a heart-stopping silence, and then a huge ferrocrete rumble. A cry of prayer sounded across the vox. There was creaking, metal twisting and groaning; there was the rumble of desperate engines. There was a single, massive splash. A wave of water sloshed back along the roadway. ‘Reverse!’ Ianthe was barking the order even as Caia heard the grind of the vehicle’s gears. It backed up so rapidly that it threw them both against the front of the hatch. The canoness didn’t pause. ‘Nikaya!’ ‘Milady.’ Through the rain, the movement of the Seraphim was clearly visible – five ascending flares of determined flame marking the Sisters as they went forwards to assess the damage. Caia tracked them with her auspex, saw them hover at what must now be the edge of the road. Ianthe called, ‘Mikaela!’ Nothing. ‘Sister Mikaela!’ Still nothing. ‘Sister Damari.’ ‘Canoness.’ The voice that came back was new, and edged with a tight strain of self-control. ‘We’ve lost the lead Immolator, it went over the edge of the road. Most of the road has followed it into the water.’ ‘Understood.’ Her response was bleak, but solid. ‘Sister Nikaya is coming to you – what is your situation?’ ‘We’re hanging by prayer alone, milady. The other two Immolators have ­successfully reversed.’ ‘Good. Hold to your faith, Sister. Do you need to abandon the vehicle?’ An ongoing creaking came back through the smoke, and echoed like a ghost over the open vox-channel. ‘I fear so. We do not have enough traction to pull back.’ ‘Then do so, you may board with Sister Salva. Nikaya, is the roadway passable?’ ‘We are blessed,’ the Seraphim Superior said grimly. ‘Truly, the Emperor is with us – the road is damaged, but has not collapsed completely. We must traverse this bridgehead carefully, and one vehicle at a time.’ Following the erratic whims of Lycheate’s weather, the wind was high and the visibility poor. As if angered by the Sisters’ impertinence, the spray roared and crashed like some furious creature, and the broken roadway groaned with strain. Gyres of garbage swilled about upon its remaining surface – jagged and rusting armaments, lost weapons, pieces of bodies where even the bone had been eaten down to its final porous fragments. But Sister Nikaya had been right; a thin path remained visi­ble. The twin gleaming rails of the servohauler tracks had better support and reinforcement than the rest of the roadway. They had been warped by the detonation, but Caia could see them, their lines leading onwards like a promise. Like a holy light in the darkness, He had shown them the way. The canoness offered a prayer of thanks. In the lash of wind and water, Caia could see Nikaya and her squad, their flaring jump packs buffeted back and forth. They were scanning the solidity of the road and its supports, making sure. Over the vox, Nikaya almost shouted. ‘The going is poor, but in His name, the uprights have held!’ Caia had a brief memory of the rock bridge upon Lautis, of the daemons waiting below. With a shudder, she shut the memory down. Nikaya continued, ‘We will not be stopped! Rayos and her forces await us!’ ‘It will take more than mines and poor weather,’ Ianthe agreed. She seemed to be thinking, assessing the trouble ahead. ‘Sister Caia? Your thoughts?’ ‘I fear I can see little more than you,’ Caia answered carefully. The green light of her auspex flickered in the rain, showing the chemical composition of the water, the heavy humidity of the air. ‘We must cross.’ ‘Luceat nobis, Sister,’ the canoness told her. ‘The dark holds no terrors for those who carry the light.’ ‘I carry no fear,’ Caia told her. ‘You would not be here if you did, Sister.’ The words were blunt enough to make Caia blink, but Ianthe was already giving more commands. ‘Roku, you will disembark from your Repressor and take position within the Immolator of Sister Cerena. Sister Maria,’ – this to Roku’s driver – ‘you will first traverse the bridge with your unladen vehicle. Sisters Mikaela and Damari, you will embark upon the final Immolator. If the unladen vehicle makes the crossing successfully, we will proceed.’ ‘In His name, canoness.’ Sister Mikaela had hauled herself bodily from her sinking tank, and had been heaved ashore by two of the flying Seraphim, hovering precariously in the battering winds. Her driver had not been so blessed, and had drowned with the vehicle. Mikaela sounded vicious, like she wanted the chance to strike back. ‘We will not be intimidated, Sisters, and we will not falter,’ Ianthe said. ‘We will do as He commands.’ And so, the unladen Repressor dared the road. By His grace, the bridge held – He had demanded the fulfilment of their mission, and not even the tech-priest’s carefully calculated ambushes were enough to stop His will. The canoness stood like a pillar of blood and scarlet, her arms folded, her orders absolute. ‘Advance!’ Following the empty vehicle, first one, then two, Immolators crept carefully out along the servohauler tracks. One at a time, they arrived at the far side and stopped, defending the remainder of the company as it traversed the gap. Augusta’s Repressor followed. Caia watched it with her heart in her mouth, praying for her Sisters. She had missed them at her side; she was used to her squad’s familial unity, to Augusta’s authority, to Viola’s heavy bolter, always beside her. To Melia’s friendship, and to Akemi’s knowledge. She did not want to leave them. Out in the raging weather, the rails were grinding as if they would give at any moment. Caia could almost hear the groaning of the already-stressed uprights, threatening to drop their support. Yet the gleam of the parallel lines remained, a clear path through the ordeal, and the canoness stood undaunted, holding them all with the strength of her faith. Her prayers did not falter, and her voice showed nothing but pure and fervent certainty. They would make the far side of this break. Caia continued to pray, watching Augusta’s Repressor as it vanished into the weather. After minutes that felt like hours, the word came back over the vox that she and the squad were safe. Caia breathed her thanks. By the Light! The canoness said, ‘Close the hatch, Sister. We must make this crossing ourselves.’ She did as she was asked, felt the Immolator rumble forwards. As it did so, the canoness’ voice changed, reciting the litany with the strength and warmth of a chapel electro-candle. Caia found herself clinging to her seat, trying not to think about the teetering, twisting-dark road, the creaking supports, the rage of the water. If the tank went over, was it watertight? She should know this, but suddenly, she wasn’t sure. If they did fall, would they be able to open the hatch, as Mikaela had done, and reach the surface? Inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, they advanced along the bridge. The Immolator was blown and buffeted. The wind slammed at its side like the batter of incoming ammunition. It lurched sideways, making Caia’s belly follow it, but she continued to pray. She wondered what would happen if Rayos’ forces attacked… But there was no attack – perhaps even the heretek could not target through this – and they reached the far side in safety. Following it, one at a time, came the Exorcists. And, at last, the great and headless volcano rose blackly before them, almost as if it were waiting.",

We bring the light of Holy Terra to the darkness that is Lycheate! Stand fast, my Sisters, and walk tall!’ She paused, looking round at the waiting tanks. ‘The heretek Rayos has tested our mettle, and she will test us again. We may face another ambush, or mines along the roadway. And if, by the Emperor’s grace, we reach the citadel without mishap, then we will still face a considerable assembled force. Captain Mulier, aboard the Kyrus, is watching the roadway with orbital eyes, and we will be ready for any eventuality!’ She paused, and Caia looked out at the red ranks of vehicles – two now missing where the Ironstriders had struck, many more showing the char-marks and buckled plates of the autocannons’ impacts. The canoness went on, ‘Thanks to the wisdom of Sister Superior Augusta, we also now believe that Rayos is not working alone – she is likely to be working for, or with, an older power, possibly another Incaladion heretek.’ Another pause, but the only response was engine noise – vehicles snarling with the eagerness to be off. ‘We will identify and execute both Rayos and her collaborator. ‘Show courage, my Sisters! Unfurl your faith like a banner and carry it high in the wind!’ Ianthe spread her arms and turned to take in all of them, as if she led and offered courage to each Sister, to each vehicle, individually. ‘We carry the heart and the torch of the Order of the Bloody Rose! We carry the courage of Mina herself. We carry the faith and fury of the Adepta Sororitas. We carry His name, and His glory, and we know no fear! Ave Imperator!’ In response, the Sisters gave a single, thundered, ‘Ave Imperator!’ Echoing the salute, Sister Nikaya gave the Repressor a stern nod as she passed – her personal check of each squad had been completed. The information, Caia guessed, would be communicated over a tight-beam link to the canoness alone. Vox-coder trumpets blared, and Ianthe blazed, ‘Forward!’ The engines rumbled their anger, and the company rolled onwards once more. Caia stood in the cupola, her auspex in her hand. Leaving the junction and the empty factorum behind them, the ranks of the Order, still in formation, drove out along the curving black road. The enemy knew that they were coming, and the Sisters raged their defiance. They broadcast the Dies Irae like a dare. Quantus tremor est futurus! The vehicles kept a strong but steady speed, the lead vehicle’s auspex constantly scanning the roadway ahead. There were fewer islands now, just a scattering of upthrust rocks, and the road itself hung over the limitless foul waters like some vast and endless bridge, a long line of industry and achievement that led onwards to the distant horizon. The Seraphim returned to their jump-pattern, and the hard chant of the hymn was a known thing – it rang out with wrath, solid and reassuring. To Caia, it felt powerful, lifting her chin and her heart and reminding her that, no matter how huge the acid sea, His presence travelled with them, in word, in deed, and in weapon. Their enemy awaited them, and they would not fail. As they rolled onwards, however, they began to encounter a new difficulty. Following another of its impulsive mood swings, the planet’s weather was deteriorating. The fat Lycheate sun had struggled its way to past mid-morning, and now the roiling brown cloud was rolling back in to smother its light. Corrosive, glutinous rain was beginning to scatter across tank and roadway alike. And where it struck, it hissed. Defended by their armour, both the canoness and Sister Caia remained standing in the back of the Immolator, the banner behind them now hanging in soggy tatters. Steadily, the rainwater ate at the fabric. Below them, in the belly of the vehicle, the injured Sister was sitting up and away from the hatch – and stridently declaring her fitness. ‘I can sit unassisted, thank you, Sister Hospitaller. Where is my weapon?’ Caia could hear Rhene grumbling, ‘You young women, never think to duck. What do they teach you in the schola? The Emperor is all-seeing, Sister Abril, but even He won’t stop an autocannon if it hits you square in the chest. How does that Treatise of yours go?’ The muttering continued, and Caia, startled by the old Hospitaller’s near-blasphemy, was even more surprised to see Ianthe turn and almost smile. Catching Caia’s expression, the canoness elegantly smoothed her own. She said, without apology, ‘Rhene deserves your respect, Sister. There are few, even within our own Order, who have seen the wars, and the deaths, and the horrors, witnessed by Sister Rhene. She may bear no armour, but she is fully combat-trained – and her bolter has slain many a slavering foe, even as she has saved the lives of the Sisters in her charge. Trust in her faith, and her knowledge, and her sanguinator.’ ‘Yes, milady.’ Caia said nothing further. For any Sister to have reached the age of the grumbling Hospitaller, and still be in the field of combat rather than teaching at the schola… it deserved veneration. And Rhene, Caia was learning, saw a great deal more than she voiced. Briefly, she thought about asking the old Hospitaller if she knew more about Caia’s own situation – what the canoness had planned for her. She considered the option, then, reluctantly, dismissed it. Much as Caia suspected an old friendship between the two women, her inquiry would be improper. Frustrated, she looked back out across the endless rain-spattered water, and continued to pray. Slowly, the hour climbed towards midday. They had covered over two-thirds of the waiting roadway, almost a hundred and fifty miles from their original muster-point… Yet still, nothing had been laid in their path. As the noontide chimes began, and the canoness broadcast the prayer for the Hour, Caia found herself becoming increasingly suspicious. She, and the others in the Immolator, recited their responses, and yet she kept one eye on the auspex, compelled and wary – almost as if Rayos could reach out to corrupt its spirit, and it would feed them false information. But the Hour’s prayers were completed without mishap, and the rain grew heavier still, limiting their visibility to barely five yards in front of the still-moving vehicles. The crumbled parts of the roadway were beginning to flood, now, and the tanks were forced to slow, navigating the puddles carefully, and washing up a great wall of water to either side. After another hour, Caia began to realise that the horizon was changing. Somewhere, out through the rain, she could make out a shadow – a wide and rising blur, like the base of some vast and jagged cone. ‘Witness the citadel,’ the canoness told her. ‘Our target – and our enemy – lie ahead. We must take extreme care, in this poor visibility. If we can see them…’ Caia, reflexively, recited one of the schola’s earliest combat lessons, ‘…then they can also see us.’ ‘Just so.’ Ianthe, her words thoughtful, made no further comment. She began to pray, not the familiar rhythm of the day’s Hours, or the bugled wrath of the Dies Irae, but something darker, low and soft, a rumble like a bared threat. It was the words of the Reflections ex Testamento Eius, one of the Order’s oldest and most sacred texts, and it felt like the sliding strop of a whetstone. Listening to it made the hairs on Caia’s arms stand on end, as if He stood close, right over her, watching her every breath, her every movement. Caia found herself anticipating the coming battle with a shudder that felt like eagerness. She was a warrior born, and she would not have this taken away, not for all the wealth in the world. And certainly not for a long robe, and a set of false and affected manners… Spare me, she prayed. Let me serve You with fist and bolter, as I have always done. They rolled on. The glutinous rain grew heavier still, driving sideways across a rising wind. It lashed at the waters at the edge of the endlessly long road, driving them to froth and anger. It covered the tanks in spray, and occasionally in things less pleasant. The clouds grew thicker, and lower, and soon, the island was lost. But they still knew it lay ahead of them. Waiting, in the gloom. The first tank-tread triggered the detonation. There was no warning; the air filled with force and noise and smoke and the whistle of flying fragments. Startled, Caia bit back a curse. The noise was followed by a heart-stopping silence, and then a huge ferrocrete rumble. A cry of prayer sounded across the vox. There was creaking, metal twisting and groaning; there was the rumble of desperate engines. There was a single, massive splash. A wave of water sloshed back along the roadway. ‘Reverse!’ Ianthe was barking the order even as Caia heard the grind of the vehicle’s gears. It backed up so rapidly that it threw them both against the front of the hatch. The canoness didn’t pause. ‘Nikaya!’ ‘Milady.’ Through the rain, the movement of the Seraphim was clearly visible – five ascending flares of determined flame marking the Sisters as they went forwards to assess the damage. Caia tracked them with her auspex, saw them hover at what must now be the edge of the road. Ianthe called, ‘Mikaela!’ Nothing. ‘Sister Mikaela!’ Still nothing. ‘Sister Damari.’ ‘Canoness.’ The voice that came back was new, and edged with a tight strain of self-control. ‘We’ve lost the lead Immolator, it went over the edge of the road. Most of the road has followed it into the water.’ ‘Understood.’ Her response was bleak, but solid. ‘Sister Nikaya is coming to you – what is your situation?’ ‘We’re hanging by prayer alone, milady. The other two Immolators have ­successfully reversed.’ ‘Good. Hold to your faith, Sister. Do you need to abandon the vehicle?’ An ongoing creaking came back through the smoke, and echoed like a ghost over the open vox-channel. ‘I fear so. We do not have enough traction to pull back.’ ‘Then do so, you may board with Sister Salva. Nikaya, is the roadway passable?’ ‘We are blessed,’ the Seraphim Superior said grimly. ‘Truly, the Emperor is with us – the road is damaged, but has not collapsed completely. We must traverse this bridgehead carefully, and one vehicle at a time.’ Following the erratic whims of Lycheate’s weather, the wind was high and the visibility poor. As if angered by the Sisters’ impertinence, the spray roared and crashed like some furious creature, and the broken roadway groaned with strain. Gyres of garbage swilled about upon its remaining surface – jagged and rusting armaments, lost weapons, pieces of bodies where even the bone had been eaten down to its final porous fragments. But Sister Nikaya had been right; a thin path remained visi­ble. The twin gleaming rails of the servohauler tracks had better support and reinforcement than the rest of the roadway. They had been warped by the detonation, but Caia could see them, their lines leading onwards like a promise. Like a holy light in the darkness, He had shown them the way. The canoness offered a prayer of thanks. In the lash of wind and water, Caia could see Nikaya and her squad, their flaring jump packs buffeted back and forth. They were scanning the solidity of the road and its supports, making sure. Over the vox, Nikaya almost shouted. ‘The going is poor, but in His name, the uprights have held!’ Caia had a brief memory of the rock bridge upon Lautis, of the daemons waiting below. With a shudder, she shut the memory down. Nikaya continued, ‘We will not be stopped! Rayos and her forces await us!’ ‘It will take more than mines and poor weather,’ Ianthe agreed. She seemed to be thinking, assessing the trouble ahead. ‘Sister Caia? Your thoughts?’ ‘I fear I can see little more than you,’ Caia answered carefully. The green light of her auspex flickered in the rain, showing the chemical composition of the water, the heavy humidity of the air. ‘We must cross.’ ‘Luceat nobis, Sister,’ the canoness told her. ‘The dark holds no terrors for those who carry the light.’ ‘I carry no fear,’ Caia told her. ‘You would not be here if you did, Sister.’ The words were blunt enough to make Caia blink, but Ianthe was already giving more commands. ‘Roku, you will disembark from your Repressor and take position within the Immolator of Sister Cerena. Sister Maria,’ – this to Roku’s driver – ‘you will first traverse the bridge with your unladen vehicle. Sisters Mikaela and Damari, you will embark upon the final Immolator. If the unladen vehicle makes the crossing successfully, we will proceed.’ ‘In His name, canoness.’ Sister Mikaela had hauled herself bodily from her sinking tank, and had been heaved ashore by two of the flying Seraphim, hovering precariously in the battering winds. Her driver had not been so blessed, and had drowned with the vehicle. Mikaela sounded vicious, like she wanted the chance to strike back. ‘We will not be intimidated, Sisters, and we will not falter,’ Ianthe said. ‘We will do as He commands.’ And so, the unladen Repressor dared the road. By His grace, the bridge held – He had demanded the fulfilment of their mission, and not even the tech-priest’s carefully calculated ambushes were enough to stop His will. The canoness stood like a pillar of blood and scarlet, her arms folded, her orders absolute. ‘Advance!’ Following the empty vehicle, first one, then two, Immolators crept carefully out along the servohauler tracks. One at a time, they arrived at the far side and stopped, defending the remainder of the company as it traversed the gap. Augusta’s Repressor followed. Caia watched it with her heart in her mouth, praying for her Sisters. She had missed them at her side; she was used to her squad’s familial unity, to Augusta’s authority, to Viola’s heavy bolter, always beside her. To Melia’s friendship, and to Akemi’s knowledge. She did not want to leave them. Out in the raging weather, the rails were grinding as if they would give at any moment. Caia could almost hear the groaning of the already-stressed uprights, threatening to drop their support. Yet the gleam of the parallel lines remained, a clear path through the ordeal, and the canoness stood undaunted, holding them all with the strength of her faith. Her prayers did not falter, and her voice showed nothing but pure and fervent certainty. They would make the far side of this break. Caia continued to pray, watching Augusta’s Repressor as it vanished into the weather. After minutes that felt like hours, the word came back over the vox that she and the squad were safe. Caia breathed her thanks. By the Light! The canoness said, ‘Close the hatch, Sister. We must make this crossing ourselves.’ She did as she was asked, felt the Immolator rumble forwards. As it did so, the canoness’ voice changed, reciting the litany with the strength and warmth of a chapel electro-candle. Caia found herself clinging to her seat, trying not to think about the teetering, twisting-dark road, the creaking supports, the rage of the water. If the tank went over, was it watertight? She should know this, but suddenly, she wasn’t sure. If they did fall, would they be able to open the hatch, as Mikaela had done, and reach the surface? Inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, they advanced along the bridge. The Immolator was blown and buffeted. The wind slammed at its side like the batter of incoming ammunition. It lurched sideways, making Caia’s belly follow it, but she continued to pray. She wondered what would happen if Rayos’ forces attacked… But there was no attack – perhaps even the heretek could not target through this – and they reached the far side in safety. Following it, one at a time, came the Exorcists. And, at last, the great and headless volcano rose blackly before them, almost as if it were waiting.",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The waters’ hunger, however, had not been quite sated. As if they demanded some final sacrifice, the very last vehicle – the Exorcist at the rear of the Order – fell as it had almost reached safety. The edge of the road gave way beneath its tracks, the ferrocrete crumbling with a thundering splash. The rails themselves held, two thin lines of steel stretching out over the water, but the roadway between them had given its last. Yards from safety, the vehicle had teetered, rocked backwards, and then splashed to its death. Its commanding Sister had called one final prayer before the density of the water had cut off her vox. Watching through the weapon-ports, hating her own enforced helplessness, Augusta had prayed for the drivers, and for the spirits of the tanks that they had lost. It would be a slow and horrifying end, the polluted sea steadily eating its way inwards, and inwards, but her fallen Sisters would show no fear, even in the face of such an ordeal. Each knew, as she did, that His light and blessing awaited her. What awaited the company was something else entirely. And Augusta held hard to her prayers, as their objective loomed ahead. A very short time later, they reached the shoreline of the citadel. The road and the tracks continued, now supported above a grey and ashen beach. Here, the wind-driven water frothed and hissed, dumping a tidemark of bubbles, dirt and rubbish, but that was not what pulled the Sister Superior’s attention. Through the weapon-port, she could just about see the outskirts of Lycheate’s central citadel: rock and beach both curved slowly upwards and into the dark, harsh side of a huge and headless mountain. And somewhere, in there, there waited the controls for the Emanatus force field. Borne by His blessing and courage, the Order had reached its target. The canoness’ prayer of thanks came over the vox, and was repeated vehemently by the surviving Sisters. ‘Nos gratias ago nomen Eius!’ We give thanks to His name! Repeating the stanzas, one after another, just as she had for so many years, Augusta shifted in her seat to scan the mountainside. Beside her, Mors and Rufus exchanged a glance – this was the place of their redemption, their final stand, and they both knew it. Once they entered the citadel, neither of them would ever see the light again. Augusta wondered if her own squad faced the same fate. The black stone was disturbingly familiar, reminding her of the jungle-planet Lautis. It was porous and severe, glittering with dark stars of scattered obsidian… …and, just like before, it concealed horrors within its depths. One thing, however, was immediately apparent. From the Kyrus’ orbital scans, Augusta knew that the main entranceway waited some half a mile ahead of them, a colossal cave mouth that swallowed the road, and that allowed the servohaulers, and the waiting machines, access to the factorum complex. Looking at their situation, she felt the hairs on her neck prickle with tension. Their route back was shattered, and they could only move ahead. And somewhere, behind that vast and unseen doorway, the heretek’s assembled forces would be waiting. The canoness, however, did not so much as pause. ‘Sister Augusta,’ she said, over the vox. ‘I have a new mission for you. Report.’ Augusta’s briefing was short and to the point. The rain had slackened, thinning to a misty drizzle. And Sister Superior Augusta, accompanied by her squad and by the two ex-Militarum, both doing their best not to shiver with the cold, had followed their new mission orders and disembarked from their Repressor. They were moving on foot, following the dirty ash beach around the long outside of the mountain. The soft surface was shifting and treacherous, hard to walk upon, but they dared not slacken their pace. They did not have time. Behind them, the surviving vehicles were continuing along the road, ready to face whatever the citadel may spit forth at them – and to ensure that Rayos’ attention was fully occupied. Augusta was following the mission brief that had come direct from the prioress herself. And, the Sister Superior was sure, this was what Sister Alcina was here to observe. If Augusta got this wrong, like her blade in the Ironstrider’s foot… What had she told Mors in the chapel? To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. Mors himself had pulled his face veil up over his nose, protecting his skin from the rain. He and Rufus both had been very quiet, their lasrifles never leaving their hands, their gazes always at the weapon-ports of the Repressor. Their deaths awaited them, but they still showed no fear, and they forged on as best they could through the clumps of infuriating sand. Perhaps, Augusta thought, Alcina was here to ensure the ex-soldiers’ deaths. One way or the other… As if Augusta herself could not be entirely trusted. A last breath of rain gusted across the wind, and slowly the clouds began to clear. Guided by the scans of the Kyrus, the squad continued to follow the long curve of the beach. It was desolate and cold, but nothing came out at them, and as the visibility increased, they began to pick up the pace. And then, they found a miracle. Following the base of a heavy spur, their route taking them back down almost to the waterline, they stopped. A distance ahead of them, a great billow of steam blurred the air, a continuous gusting rise of long grey smoke like the exhalations of some vast machine-spirit. And, as they crested the spur, they saw it: a wide red run of lava that came sliding down the mountainside, a flaring river of fire sloughing through the dense black stone. And, where its front edge met the water, it slowly solidified into great static waves of cooling, hissing rock, one piling upon another. Flames licked over the water’s surface – the lingering patches of oil ignited by the heat. The squad paused. Their suits protected them, but the air shimmered with thermal currents. Augusta had never seen such a thing, never even imagined it – this meeting of fire and water. It seemed almost to contain a spirit all of its own. But she dared not pause long. Stepping forwards with her auspex, Rhea said, ‘We cannot pass here, the temperature is too great. To reach the fissure that the Kyrus has identified, we must ascend the slope.’ ‘Mors?’ Augusta asked. ‘How do you fare?’ The ex-corporal had left his face veil in place. He was muttering back down the line at Rufus, ‘Damned air must be eighty per cent sulphur.’ At the Sister Superior’s words, though, he straightened his shoulders and replied, ‘We fare well, though the temperature is high. And we are fortunate that the rain has eased.’ ‘Aye,’ she said. ‘Walk with courage, we will not be in the open for much longer.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ He paused. Then at a nudge from his squadmate, he said, ’Sister, before we enter this place, may I say something?’ Augusta stopped, indicated for the squad to do likewise. ‘Of course. But swiftly.’ ‘I… we… would like you to take this.’ He held out one hand, something folded in his gloved fist. ‘It is true that we’re deserters, Sister, and we deserve only death. But we still hope to redeem ourselves, somewhere within this great citadel.’ He faltered, and Rufus stepped forwards. ‘It’s our insignia, Sister,’ he said. ‘I know we have no right to ask, but if you could take it back to our captain…’ He ran out of words, dropped his gaze, and stepped back. Augusta held out her gauntlet, let Mors drop the insignia into her fist – the winged skull of the Militarum, a star upon its forehead. She looked at it, and then back at the two young men, so weary and resolved. ‘Conduct yourselves with honour,’ she said, ‘and I will do so. Your tale will not go unremembered.’ The squad turned to head upwards, the mountainside treacherous and the going slippery. But here, too, a path had been laid out for them just as it had been over the water – the rocks had formed into a peculiar, regular pattern of hexagonal pillars, just as if He had been here, carving miraculous steps in the stone, and showing them the way. ‘Truly,’ Augusta muttered, ‘we are blessed. Twice now, He has left us a clear path.’ Red boots skidded, but the squad went on. Viola, her heavy bolter slung over her back, cursed as she heaved herself bodily upwards. Mors and Rufus ascended more easily, their kit a lighter load. And, as the squad climbed higher, they began to find holes in the slope – splits and cracks and fissures, places where the pressure of the volcano within had just proven too much, and had broken out through the ancient stone. Following Rhea’s auspex, Augusta paused at the largest of these. ‘From this point,’ she said to her squad, ‘we will know little. We do not bear maps of this location, and the density of the stone will prevent communication with either the Kyrus, or with the canoness.’ She took a moment to look around at them. ‘I am proud of you, Sisters, every one of you. And you, Mors and Rufus both. This is a test of our faith and our resourcefulness, and one we will not fail. The entire Order is depending upon our success.’ The split in the stone was blacker than the mountainside, and wide enough for their armour – but only just. ‘Sister Rhea, Sister Viola. Let us proceed.’ ‘Aye.’ With the auspex and the heavy bolter at their head, they left the brown Lycheate sun behind them. From here, they would be walking blind. But He had shown them the way, and the light they carried was illumination enough. The tunnels were tight, and treacherous. Augusta’s feet slipped on the cold stone. It was irregular and it tripped her constantly – it seemed that she skidded with every fourth step. In places, outcrops snagged at her shoulders or elbows, or on the tip of her chainsword. The claustrophobic sensation was uncomfortable, and the crackling in the vox reminded her, very clearly, of the hard black density of the rock. The faint light of the tunnel mouth soon faded to a line, and then vanished completely. She had a shuddering memory of the Lautis daemon – curse it for still being able to haunt her! This was no place to harbour such thoughts. Their suit-lights flared hope on the rock face, and they moved on. With the vox now quiet, Augusta began to hear the constant drip-drip of water, the noise distant and oddly hollow, and then, from somewhere else, the heavy rattle of something distinctly metallic. Like a gate, or an overhead door. They moved on, the green glint of Rhea’s auspex at their head. The tunnels seemed natural, jagged and angled – they looked as if some great force had struck the stone, sending splintering cracks in every direction. The spaces were narrow and irregular, unsupported by scaffolding, and yet they steadily ate their way downwards, deeper and deeper into the mountain’s heart. Slowly, the passages grew wider… and the air grew steadily hotter. And then, Rhea stopped. ‘We have reached the end of the fissure, Sister. This crack opens out onto a smooth-bore tunnel.’ ‘Anything in motion? Any security?’ ‘Not that I can detect.’ ‘Be sure. Rayos’ attention will be on the tanks on her doorstep, but I do not wish to attract her notice.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Over Viola’s shoulder, Augusta could see the opening that Rhea had found – the rough, ragged split of the tunnel-edge opening out onto smoothly worked stone, and then continuing on its other side. She thought she could see the walls, engraved with the same prayers that they had seen upon the metal of the Lycheate city. She counted the awareness check in her head, Five seconds. Four… Three… She reached zero. Nothing had moved. ‘Very well. We will proceed with caution.’ Still, they found nothing. Out in the corridors, the security scanners lay dormant, and not so much as a servo-skull hummed across their path. Strips of lumens worked erratically, sending flickering data-ghosts along the long-abandoned walkways of the departed Mechanicus’ citadel. ‘These are not mining tunnels,’ Augusta commented. ‘They must be for maintenance, for servitors or helots, perhaps.’ Maintenance or not, the corridors were precise; their angles exact. As the squad moved on, Augusta began to see old pict-screens, vents and data-banks, and cog-marks engraved in the walls. The corroded remains of pipes wove in and out of the stone, and between them lay prayers that she could not decipher. The air grew warmer still. A little further, and each turning began to carry markings, denominations in both binary and machine-code. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta said, over the vox. ‘The numbers are very clear, Sister,’ Akemi responded. ‘This is conservation and maintenance level four-point-zero-six-five, and the tunnels are worked to a routine hexagonal pattern. The progression of numbers does suggest a single central control point. I would guess that it’s an identical layout to that of the factoria themselves, just on a smaller scale.’ She paused, then added, almost amused, ‘We are blessed that the Mechanicus remain so predictable.’ ‘We must offer our thanks, Sister Akemi,’ Augusta said. ‘Can we follow these numbers to the central location?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then you will join Sister Rhea, and we will continue. Viola, pull back.’ It grew hotter. The temperature readout in Augusta’s armour was climbing higher with every turning they made. Behind her, Mors was sweating profusely; he’d dropped the face veil and his dark skin shone in the suit-lights. Soon, the air began to shimmer with the thickness of the heat. Another turning, and another, Akemi counting as they went. A third, and they saw their first lava flow – a thin, sliding trickle that broke through the tunnel wall and oozed down towards the smoothly worked floor, cooling as it descended. It left a swelling growth like a tumour, rippling and bulbous, and slowly, slowly growing. It also obscured the old Mechanicus wall markings. ‘So, these fissures are more recent than the tunnels themselves,’ Augusta commented. ‘It may explain why they are abandoned – and why the Mechanicus have been so reluctant to return to this world.’ ‘There is no current evidence of seismic or volcanic activity,’ Rhea answered, from the front. ‘These fissures are old, and they read as stable. We are secure. Certainly for the moment.’ They continued, passing more and more of the tiny, fissured flows, some of them beginning to run together, others steadily eating through the floor. None of them were large – the Sisters could step across every one – but the temperature was still climbing. Mors and Rufus were beginning to struggle with the relentlessness of the heat. Unspeaking, Augusta passed Mors back her water bottle. And then Rhea told them to halt. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘There is a large space ahead of us. We have found the central factorum.’ The door was vast, and utterly impassable. It was a rusted sheet of steel in the side of the mountain. It cut dead across the roadway, and across the gleaming servohauler tracks. A march of sagging pillars flanked its approach, all linked by aged steel chains; empty flame-bowls stood to either side. Turret emplacements had been long bereft of their weapons, and some huge ferrocrete statue had crumbled until only the last few feet remained. Upon the door itself, the colossal cog-and-skull was leeringly familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Caia said, without surprise. Above the gate’s silent threat, the black wall of the volcano rose both faceless and headless, and the brown clouds seemed to rest upon its top. Tiny red flares shifted across its surface as Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim rose aloft to assess its defences. ‘The Emanatus force field covers only the very top of the volcano,’ Nikaya said. ‘There are multiple defence ports, but they’re sealed.’ ‘Hold fast, my Sisters.’ The canoness’ tone was cautious, but contained no fear. Caia knew that they would be facing overwhelming numbers, as well as the point-defences of the citadel itself, but these things were of no consequence. Their task was to draw the fire of the enemy, while Augusta and her squad penetrated the depths of the mountain. She prayed for them, for her fallen Sisters, for herself. Standing in the back of the Immolator, looking up at that huge and grinning skull, Caia wondered if Rayos had calculated every probability of their advance, of their every movement and choice. Wondered if the heretek had drawn them here, knowing that they would be defeated– The auspex blipped movement. Not much, barely a flicker – a single contact. It moved as if a sergeant walked along his ranks of troops, inspecting and commanding them, as if– As if they were expected. She was about to speak – some sort of warning – but the great door rattled, grumbled, and began to rise. The rasping noise of rust was teeth-gratingly painful. Sister Caia stared forwards, and into the gaping dark. ‘How many?’ Augusta asked. In Rhea’s hand, the glowing green screen of the auspex was still. ‘None.’ They had come to a balcony, a high viewpoint above an echoingly empty space – Vastum Factorum-01, and Rayos’ muster point. And this one did not follow the layout of its fellows. There were no hoppers here, no facilities for construction or creation. This was surely just a storage facility, yet it seemed endless, stretching away from them, further than they could see. It was floored with smooth black stone – the great basalt plug of the volcano. And within that stone were laid long parallel lines of gleaming steel, one after another after another, all of them vanishing into its cavernous limits. An identical series of upright supports, looming like gibbets in the half-light, rose from each one – lines and lines and lines of static mini-shrines, each one a prayer point where the stored machine-spirit could find its rest. And every one of them stood empty. ‘The canoness’ plan has been successful.’ Augusta’s tone was quiet, and swallowed by the hugeness of the room. ‘The heretek’s force is distracted.’ Alcina answered, her voice grim, ‘Our Sisters will be paying for every moment we delay.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. ‘We must locate the central control node. Sister Rhea, does anything remain in this location?’ Rhea held her auspex, moving it slowly in an arc. ‘Nothing, Sister.’ ‘Then we will proceed with our mission brief. We will follow the numerals to the central location, and there, we will disable the force field. And may the Emperor stand with our Sisters as they face Rayos’ army.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER SEVEN The waters’ hunger, however, had not been quite sated. As if they demanded some final sacrifice, the very last vehicle – the Exorcist at the rear of the Order – fell as it had almost reached safety. The edge of the road gave way beneath its tracks, the ferrocrete crumbling with a thundering splash. The rails themselves held, two thin lines of steel stretching out over the water, but the roadway between them had given its last. Yards from safety, the vehicle had teetered, rocked backwards, and then splashed to its death. Its commanding Sister had called one final prayer before the density of the water had cut off her vox. Watching through the weapon-ports, hating her own enforced helplessness, Augusta had prayed for the drivers, and for the spirits of the tanks that they had lost. It would be a slow and horrifying end, the polluted sea steadily eating its way inwards, and inwards, but her fallen Sisters would show no fear, even in the face of such an ordeal. Each knew, as she did, that His light and blessing awaited her. What awaited the company was something else entirely. And Augusta held hard to her prayers, as their objective loomed ahead. A very short time later, they reached the shoreline of the citadel. The road and the tracks continued, now supported above a grey and ashen beach. Here, the wind-driven water frothed and hissed, dumping a tidemark of bubbles, dirt and rubbish, but that was not what pulled the Sister Superior’s attention. Through the weapon-port, she could just about see the outskirts of Lycheate’s central citadel: rock and beach both curved slowly upwards and into the dark, harsh side of a huge and headless mountain. And somewhere, in there, there waited the controls for the Emanatus force field. Borne by His blessing and courage, the Order had reached its target. The canoness’ prayer of thanks came over the vox, and was repeated vehemently by the surviving Sisters. ‘Nos gratias ago nomen Eius!’ We give thanks to His name! Repeating the stanzas, one after another, just as she had for so many years, Augusta shifted in her seat to scan the mountainside. Beside her, Mors and Rufus exchanged a glance – this was the place of their redemption, their final stand, and they both knew it. Once they entered the citadel, neither of them would ever see the light again. Augusta wondered if her own squad faced the same fate. The black stone was disturbingly familiar, reminding her of the jungle-planet Lautis. It was porous and severe, glittering with dark stars of scattered obsidian… …and, just like before, it concealed horrors within its depths. One thing, however, was immediately apparent. From the Kyrus’ orbital scans, Augusta knew that the main entranceway waited some half a mile ahead of them, a colossal cave mouth that swallowed the road, and that allowed the servohaulers, and the waiting machines, access to the factorum complex. Looking at their situation, she felt the hairs on her neck prickle with tension. Their route back was shattered, and they could only move ahead. And somewhere, behind that vast and unseen doorway, the heretek’s assembled forces would be waiting. The canoness, however, did not so much as pause. ‘Sister Augusta,’ she said, over the vox. ‘I have a new mission for you. Report.’ Augusta’s briefing was short and to the point. The rain had slackened, thinning to a misty drizzle. And Sister Superior Augusta, accompanied by her squad and by the two ex-Militarum, both doing their best not to shiver with the cold, had followed their new mission orders and disembarked from their Repressor. They were moving on foot, following the dirty ash beach around the long outside of the mountain. The soft surface was shifting and treacherous, hard to walk upon, but they dared not slacken their pace. They did not have time. Behind them, the surviving vehicles were continuing along the road, ready to face whatever the citadel may spit forth at them – and to ensure that Rayos’ attention was fully occupied. Augusta was following the mission brief that had come direct from the prioress herself. And, the Sister Superior was sure, this was what Sister Alcina was here to observe. If Augusta got this wrong, like her blade in the Ironstrider’s foot… What had she told Mors in the chapel? To serve Holy Terra, and to die with honour. Mors himself had pulled his face veil up over his nose, protecting his skin from the rain. He and Rufus both had been very quiet, their lasrifles never leaving their hands, their gazes always at the weapon-ports of the Repressor. Their deaths awaited them, but they still showed no fear, and they forged on as best they could through the clumps of infuriating sand. Perhaps, Augusta thought, Alcina was here to ensure the ex-soldiers’ deaths. One way or the other… As if Augusta herself could not be entirely trusted. A last breath of rain gusted across the wind, and slowly the clouds began to clear. Guided by the scans of the Kyrus, the squad continued to follow the long curve of the beach. It was desolate and cold, but nothing came out at them, and as the visibility increased, they began to pick up the pace. And then, they found a miracle. Following the base of a heavy spur, their route taking them back down almost to the waterline, they stopped. A distance ahead of them, a great billow of steam blurred the air, a continuous gusting rise of long grey smoke like the exhalations of some vast machine-spirit. And, as they crested the spur, they saw it: a wide red run of lava that came sliding down the mountainside, a flaring river of fire sloughing through the dense black stone. And, where its front edge met the water, it slowly solidified into great static waves of cooling, hissing rock, one piling upon another. Flames licked over the water’s surface – the lingering patches of oil ignited by the heat. The squad paused. Their suits protected them, but the air shimmered with thermal currents. Augusta had never seen such a thing, never even imagined it – this meeting of fire and water. It seemed almost to contain a spirit all of its own. But she dared not pause long. Stepping forwards with her auspex, Rhea said, ‘We cannot pass here, the temperature is too great. To reach the fissure that the Kyrus has identified, we must ascend the slope.’ ‘Mors?’ Augusta asked. ‘How do you fare?’ The ex-corporal had left his face veil in place. He was muttering back down the line at Rufus, ‘Damned air must be eighty per cent sulphur.’ At the Sister Superior’s words, though, he straightened his shoulders and replied, ‘We fare well, though the temperature is high. And we are fortunate that the rain has eased.’ ‘Aye,’ she said. ‘Walk with courage, we will not be in the open for much longer.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ He paused. Then at a nudge from his squadmate, he said, ’Sister, before we enter this place, may I say something?’ Augusta stopped, indicated for the squad to do likewise. ‘Of course. But swiftly.’ ‘I… we… would like you to take this.’ He held out one hand, something folded in his gloved fist. ‘It is true that we’re deserters, Sister, and we deserve only death. But we still hope to redeem ourselves, somewhere within this great citadel.’ He faltered, and Rufus stepped forwards. ‘It’s our insignia, Sister,’ he said. ‘I know we have no right to ask, but if you could take it back to our captain…’ He ran out of words, dropped his gaze, and stepped back. Augusta held out her gauntlet, let Mors drop the insignia into her fist – the winged skull of the Militarum, a star upon its forehead. She looked at it, and then back at the two young men, so weary and resolved. ‘Conduct yourselves with honour,’ she said, ‘and I will do so. Your tale will not go unremembered.’ The squad turned to head upwards, the mountainside treacherous and the going slippery. But here, too, a path had been laid out for them just as it had been over the water – the rocks had formed into a peculiar, regular pattern of hexagonal pillars, just as if He had been here, carving miraculous steps in the stone, and showing them the way. ‘Truly,’ Augusta muttered, ‘we are blessed. Twice now, He has left us a clear path.’ Red boots skidded, but the squad went on. Viola, her heavy bolter slung over her back, cursed as she heaved herself bodily upwards. Mors and Rufus ascended more easily, their kit a lighter load. And, as the squad climbed higher, they began to find holes in the slope – splits and cracks and fissures, places where the pressure of the volcano within had just proven too much, and had broken out through the ancient stone. Following Rhea’s auspex, Augusta paused at the largest of these. ‘From this point,’ she said to her squad, ‘we will know little. We do not bear maps of this location, and the density of the stone will prevent communication with either the Kyrus, or with the canoness.’ She took a moment to look around at them. ‘I am proud of you, Sisters, every one of you. And you, Mors and Rufus both. This is a test of our faith and our resourcefulness, and one we will not fail. The entire Order is depending upon our success.’ The split in the stone was blacker than the mountainside, and wide enough for their armour – but only just. ‘Sister Rhea, Sister Viola. Let us proceed.’ ‘Aye.’ With the auspex and the heavy bolter at their head, they left the brown Lycheate sun behind them. From here, they would be walking blind. But He had shown them the way, and the light they carried was illumination enough. The tunnels were tight, and treacherous. Augusta’s feet slipped on the cold stone. It was irregular and it tripped her constantly – it seemed that she skidded with every fourth step. In places, outcrops snagged at her shoulders or elbows, or on the tip of her chainsword. The claustrophobic sensation was uncomfortable, and the crackling in the vox reminded her, very clearly, of the hard black density of the rock. The faint light of the tunnel mouth soon faded to a line, and then vanished completely. She had a shuddering memory of the Lautis daemon – curse it for still being able to haunt her! This was no place to harbour such thoughts. Their suit-lights flared hope on the rock face, and they moved on. With the vox now quiet, Augusta began to hear the constant drip-drip of water, the noise distant and oddly hollow, and then, from somewhere else, the heavy rattle of something distinctly metallic. Like a gate, or an overhead door. They moved on, the green glint of Rhea’s auspex at their head. The tunnels seemed natural, jagged and angled – they looked as if some great force had struck the stone, sending splintering cracks in every direction. The spaces were narrow and irregular, unsupported by scaffolding, and yet they steadily ate their way downwards, deeper and deeper into the mountain’s heart. Slowly, the passages grew wider… and the air grew steadily hotter. And then, Rhea stopped. ‘We have reached the end of the fissure, Sister. This crack opens out onto a smooth-bore tunnel.’ ‘Anything in motion? Any security?’ ‘Not that I can detect.’ ‘Be sure. Rayos’ attention will be on the tanks on her doorstep, but I do not wish to attract her notice.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Over Viola’s shoulder, Augusta could see the opening that Rhea had found – the rough, ragged split of the tunnel-edge opening out onto smoothly worked stone, and then continuing on its other side. She thought she could see the walls, engraved with the same prayers that they had seen upon the metal of the Lycheate city. She counted the awareness check in her head, Five seconds. Four… Three… She reached zero. Nothing had moved. ‘Very well. We will proceed with caution.’ Still, they found nothing. Out in the corridors, the security scanners lay dormant, and not so much as a servo-skull hummed across their path. Strips of lumens worked erratically, sending flickering data-ghosts along the long-abandoned walkways of the departed Mechanicus’ citadel. ‘These are not mining tunnels,’ Augusta commented. ‘They must be for maintenance, for servitors or helots, perhaps.’ Maintenance or not, the corridors were precise; their angles exact. As the squad moved on, Augusta began to see old pict-screens, vents and data-banks, and cog-marks engraved in the walls. The corroded remains of pipes wove in and out of the stone, and between them lay prayers that she could not decipher. The air grew warmer still. A little further, and each turning began to carry markings, denominations in both binary and machine-code. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta said, over the vox. ‘The numbers are very clear, Sister,’ Akemi responded. ‘This is conservation and maintenance level four-point-zero-six-five, and the tunnels are worked to a routine hexagonal pattern. The progression of numbers does suggest a single central control point. I would guess that it’s an identical layout to that of the factoria themselves, just on a smaller scale.’ She paused, then added, almost amused, ‘We are blessed that the Mechanicus remain so predictable.’ ‘We must offer our thanks, Sister Akemi,’ Augusta said. ‘Can we follow these numbers to the central location?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ ‘Then you will join Sister Rhea, and we will continue. Viola, pull back.’ It grew hotter. The temperature readout in Augusta’s armour was climbing higher with every turning they made. Behind her, Mors was sweating profusely; he’d dropped the face veil and his dark skin shone in the suit-lights. Soon, the air began to shimmer with the thickness of the heat. Another turning, and another, Akemi counting as they went. A third, and they saw their first lava flow – a thin, sliding trickle that broke through the tunnel wall and oozed down towards the smoothly worked floor, cooling as it descended. It left a swelling growth like a tumour, rippling and bulbous, and slowly, slowly growing. It also obscured the old Mechanicus wall markings. ‘So, these fissures are more recent than the tunnels themselves,’ Augusta commented. ‘It may explain why they are abandoned – and why the Mechanicus have been so reluctant to return to this world.’ ‘There is no current evidence of seismic or volcanic activity,’ Rhea answered, from the front. ‘These fissures are old, and they read as stable. We are secure. Certainly for the moment.’ They continued, passing more and more of the tiny, fissured flows, some of them beginning to run together, others steadily eating through the floor. None of them were large – the Sisters could step across every one – but the temperature was still climbing. Mors and Rufus were beginning to struggle with the relentlessness of the heat. Unspeaking, Augusta passed Mors back her water bottle. And then Rhea told them to halt. ‘Sisters,’ she said. ‘There is a large space ahead of us. We have found the central factorum.’ The door was vast, and utterly impassable. It was a rusted sheet of steel in the side of the mountain. It cut dead across the roadway, and across the gleaming servohauler tracks. A march of sagging pillars flanked its approach, all linked by aged steel chains; empty flame-bowls stood to either side. Turret emplacements had been long bereft of their weapons, and some huge ferrocrete statue had crumbled until only the last few feet remained. Upon the door itself, the colossal cog-and-skull was leeringly familiar. ‘Incaladion,’ Caia said, without surprise. Above the gate’s silent threat, the black wall of the volcano rose both faceless and headless, and the brown clouds seemed to rest upon its top. Tiny red flares shifted across its surface as Sister Nikaya and the Seraphim rose aloft to assess its defences. ‘The Emanatus force field covers only the very top of the volcano,’ Nikaya said. ‘There are multiple defence ports, but they’re sealed.’ ‘Hold fast, my Sisters.’ The canoness’ tone was cautious, but contained no fear. Caia knew that they would be facing overwhelming numbers, as well as the point-defences of the citadel itself, but these things were of no consequence. Their task was to draw the fire of the enemy, while Augusta and her squad penetrated the depths of the mountain. She prayed for them, for her fallen Sisters, for herself. Standing in the back of the Immolator, looking up at that huge and grinning skull, Caia wondered if Rayos had calculated every probability of their advance, of their every movement and choice. Wondered if the heretek had drawn them here, knowing that they would be defeated– The auspex blipped movement. Not much, barely a flicker – a single contact. It moved as if a sergeant walked along his ranks of troops, inspecting and commanding them, as if– As if they were expected. She was about to speak – some sort of warning – but the great door rattled, grumbled, and began to rise. The rasping noise of rust was teeth-gratingly painful. Sister Caia stared forwards, and into the gaping dark. ‘How many?’ Augusta asked. In Rhea’s hand, the glowing green screen of the auspex was still. ‘None.’ They had come to a balcony, a high viewpoint above an echoingly empty space – Vastum Factorum-01, and Rayos’ muster point. And this one did not follow the layout of its fellows. There were no hoppers here, no facilities for construction or creation. This was surely just a storage facility, yet it seemed endless, stretching away from them, further than they could see. It was floored with smooth black stone – the great basalt plug of the volcano. And within that stone were laid long parallel lines of gleaming steel, one after another after another, all of them vanishing into its cavernous limits. An identical series of upright supports, looming like gibbets in the half-light, rose from each one – lines and lines and lines of static mini-shrines, each one a prayer point where the stored machine-spirit could find its rest. And every one of them stood empty. ‘The canoness’ plan has been successful.’ Augusta’s tone was quiet, and swallowed by the hugeness of the room. ‘The heretek’s force is distracted.’ Alcina answered, her voice grim, ‘Our Sisters will be paying for every moment we delay.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. ‘We must locate the central control node. Sister Rhea, does anything remain in this location?’ Rhea held her auspex, moving it slowly in an arc. ‘Nothing, Sister.’ ‘Then we will proceed with our mission brief. We will follow the numerals to the central location, and there, we will disable the force field. And may the Emperor stand with our Sisters as they face Rayos’ army.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT Somewhere in the darkness there moved weapons, and metal, and flesh. Sister Caia had seen the Lycheate machines before – the Breacher that had assaulted them upon their arrival, the kastelans that had answered to Rayos, and to Scafidis Zale. She had never seen anything like this. These things were horror-spawned, from the corrupt mind of the heretek. They were wrong, somehow – their weapons lopsided or crudely built, their bodies twisted, their feet or tracks dragging sparks that flashed like the meetings of wires. She knew little about machine-spirits, but her heart understood: these were abominations. The red lines of tanks had formed into an inverse arc, grouped before the now-open doorway. At the centre, now, the canoness stood in her Immolator with one hand aloft, holding back her troops’ desire to fire, and waiting for the enemy to fully reveal itself, sliding and grinding like corruption from the dark. More sounds came from above them – the defence ports were sliding open. But Nikaya and the Seraphim were waiting, their jump packs holding them tight to the rock face and out of range of fire. From the assembled Sisters, the unified words of the litany were like the threatening rumble of an avalanche – as if, once these machines entered the doorway itself, the might of the God-Emperor would bring the entire side of the mountain down upon them… But Rayos was not that foolish. Her force stopped, pausing just inside the cave’s huge mouth. It waited in the semi-dark, ragged and misshapen, listing and slumping, just as if the Ruinous Powers themselves had taken a hand in its formation. And a voice, so familiar to Sister Caia, echoed from the stone, from the metal, from the twitching, jerking skulls of the Breachers and Destroyers… ‘Sisters,’ Rayos’ voice said. It was logic-cold, yet it somehow seemed to hiss with that same thin, cold humour that Caia remembered from their previous meeting. ‘You have erred. There is an eighty-nine-point-eight per cent chance that you will lose this confrontation. You, with your faith, and your weak and human flesh.’ The canoness did not respond, except with the continuing thud and threat of the litany, booming like military drums. It echoed back from the mountainside. Caia’s hand tightened on her bolter, though it was her auspex that she watched. She said, quietly, ‘There are more of them, waiting out of our line of sight.’ Ianthe gave a single, grave nod. ‘Estimation of total numbers, Sister Caia.’ Caia replied, ‘Maybe two hundred and fifty individual units.’ ‘Their greatest concentration?’ ‘At the very rear.’ ‘Very well. Then let us finish this.’ Her shout came over the vox-coder, blasted through the pipes that still stood upon the top of her Immolator. ‘Immolators, Seraphim! Fire!’ And the Sisters’ wrath was loosed upon the enemy. Deep in the mountain tunnels, that first rumble of gunfire echoed like the boom of some distant heartbeat. Augusta felt Alcina, behind her, tense; heard Rhea catch her breath. Whatever happened down here, their Sisters were fighting and dying to give them time to achieve their goal. And they dared not falter. ‘We must move,’ she said, a thrum of urgency to her tone. ‘This mission will not permit us to dawdle.’ Beside her, Mors nodded. His nose and cheeks had taken scattered burn damage from the acid drizzle, but he’d made no complaint, and they had not stopped. Led only by Rhea’s scan and Akemi’s counting, they began to move more swiftly. The distant thunder of weapons continued, and the crackling of the empty vox told the Sister Superior, more clearly than any shout of urgency, that they could not afford to delay. She reviewed her new mission orders: once they had eliminated the force field, they were to retreat. The Kyrus would be beginning her countdown the moment she had a clear line of fire. The citadel was large enough that the massed tanks of the Order would survive… But Augusta’s squad were on foot. Offer your lives to the Emperor. She silenced the flicker of doubt with a flare of annoyance. Neither Mors nor Rufus had flinched, had shown the slightest fear. And she was Sororitas – if she were to perish in the line of her duty, then it would be with courage. Despite Istrix’s death, she would face the Golden Throne knowing she had died with her honour intact. If it were possible, however, she would uphold her responsibilities. Her squad were blameless, following her orders, and she would allow her Sisters to retreat, survive… Spare them Your wrath, she prayed. They have done nothing wrong. She would face her fate alone. Alone, or with these two young soldiers that had come so far. Akemi paused by another marker, and told them to turn left. They seemed to be moving in an arc, heading inwards, and still down. It was a long haul, but the corridors were steadily widening and the Sisters were beginning to watch for servitors, for skitarii, or for wherever Rayos may have left here to guard her main force. Yet still, there was nothing. If there were foot-troops, then perhaps they, too, had been mustered outside to face the canoness. And Ianthe would show them no mercy. Then Sister Rhea said, ‘Wait.’ In the silence of the corridor, they paused. The tunnels were still. Brass pipes ran like veins along their ceilings; wires clung to the stone, now bereft of information or power. The pict-screens flickered with vestiges of life, their half-formed data-ghosts striving to manifest. They sent odd, eerie lighting down the empty stone. Mors said, his deep voice quiet, ‘It’s still getting warmer–’ ‘The temperature has significantly risen,’ Sister Rhea confirmed, cutting him off. ‘I suspect there will be another lava flow ahead – a large one.’ ‘We are very close now,’ Akemi said. ‘The central forge temple lies ahead.’ In the distance, the boom and rattle of gunfire continued. ‘Do not pause,’ Sister Alcina said sternly. ‘Our Sisters fight for our time, and we must achieve our target.’ Alcina’s repetition was unnecessary, but Augusta said nothing. Her new second was not wrong, and the Sister Superior was beginning to suspect that there might be another reason why there were no defences down there. Rayos had no need of them. ‘Head right, then left, then right again,’ Akemi said. ‘Sister Rhea,’ Augusta commented. ‘You are familiar with the device that we seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Rhea said. ‘I do not possess Sister Akemi’s literacy, but I have seen such things before, on Mete, and the Mechanicus remain obsessively consistent. I will be able to shut down the force field.’ ‘We will proceed,’ Augusta said. ‘Walk swiftly, but with caution.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved onwards. Augusta could not read the machine dialect that was now flickering on the half-dead pict-screens, but she could see that the strings of binary were becoming shorter. Akemi was surely right – they were closing in on the central facility. Mors had pulled his face veil back up over his nose – the air was becoming more sulphurous. And Augusta was beginning to see it: the light was changing. Amid the flickers of the pict-screens, there was a deeper, steadier illumination, a soft red glow that was gradually growing stronger. The Sisters had seen this glow before. The ruddy colour of bare lava, somewhere ahead of them. Weapons roared alongside the vocal thunder of unified prayer. The air was thick with smoke and debris, with the flow and spark of living data, with the groaning and grinding of the strange, lopsided machines. Surrounded by the rage of battle, the Sisters’ tanks held their position. Their stationary formation was intended to pull Rayos’ forces out of the mountain, and then bring the stone down upon them, but Rayos was too wily, and her lines did not advance. Instead, her front rank opened fire. Caia, still standing behind the canoness in the lead Immolator, wondered why she did not deign to duck back inside the vehicle – but the moment Ianthe raised her pistol and opened fire herself, Caia understood. A streak of yellow light hit the end Breacher and its chest simply exploded, spattering its tracked base with gore. In the remaining mess, its exposed cogs spun for a startled second, and then were still. Caia opened her bolter to a full suppression, her rounds chewing holes in the next Breacher along. Its twisted human face showed no pain, no emotion, nothing – but it raised its shoulder and the weapon attached, and Caia knew that it would shoot straight at them. Ianthe sang the litany like a call of trumpets, and dared it to even consider the action. To either side of them, the surviving two Immolators were shooting with their heavy bolters, the weapons turning in suppression arcs. The two Repressors had remained still, waiting for the moment that the Order would roll forwards and into the cave mouth, but, for now, Ianthe was still holding them where they were. At the rear, the Exorcists were loaded and ready, but Rayos had been too clever. Calculating exactly the amount to raise the door, the arcing missiles did not have the necessary clearance, and their bolters could not shoot past the vehicles in the front. Above her, Caia was aware of the Seraphim, flitting across the rock face. With her focus on the enemy, she caught them from the corners of her vision, each one holding her place below a shielded gun port, then jumping upwards to shoot clean through the slit and eliminate the servitor, or gunner, that had been about to fire. Four of the Seraphim defeated their static targets with almost perfect flying manoeuvres; the fifth was less blessed. She missed, and the autocannon swivelled, catching her full in the chest. She spasmed backwards, then fell, plummeting with a streak of flame behind her. When she hit the ground, she crumpled like a broken thing. She did not move again. For a split second, Caia blinked at the broken corpse, appalled at how suddenly a Sister could perish, torn from the air and the battle with the brief blast of a weapon… But she stood before the Throne, her service completed. Blessed be her memory. Despite the loss, however, the Order was doing damage – the machines in the front were juddering under the heavy combined fire of the two Immolators and under the huge impacts of the canoness’ shooting. It was only as the first rank tumbled, however, that Caia realised they’d been bolter-fodder. And that the main attack was still to come. ‘Sisters,’ Akemi said. ‘We have reached corridor zero-zero-two, and the final junction. The side of the forge temple lies directly ahead.’ ‘Hold.’ Augusta’s command brought both Akemi and Rhea to a stop. Rhea, reflexively, responded, ‘Nothing moving, Sister, but the temperature is extreme.’ The squad had paused just short of the tunnel’s smooth and open mouth. Somewhere ahead of them, red light shone up from below, bathing the rock ceiling in a rich, ruddy sheen. Beside the Sister Superior, Mors was sagging, sheeted in sweat. His clothing was stained with it, but he still made no word of complaint. Rhea added, her voice soft in the vox, ‘Sisters, we have reached our goal.’ Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… A prayer in her heart, Augusta moved forwards to see for herself. And stopped. Their tunnel opened out at the lip of a massive rift. No, not a rift, a chasm. A great, jagged moat that cracked clean down through the stone – an abyss from which the lava-light rose like fire, before losing itself in the vast darkness overhead. But that wasn’t all. By the Light! The Sister Superior held back the exclamation – she would show no fear, no doubt. But, out there ahead of her, on the far side of the rift, there rose a huge and mighty wall, black as basalt, and carved into vast square oriels and heavy, angled buttresses. It was clearly the wall of some immense cathedral, and yet it was layered with wheeled cogs, with folded cranes, with openings like vents and waste-chutes, and with colossal pipes, layered one upon another like a writhing mass of creeper. It stretched up and up, to the heights of the unseen roof, and down and down, far into the firepit below. The pipes’ metal glowed red with the heat, but by some Mechanicus wonder that she could not begin to comprehend, it had neither melted nor faltered – and it lit the great building with a glow like pure hellfire. ‘Forge temple,’ she said, not hiding the awe in her tone. ‘In His name, I could never have imagined one so huge. Truly, this is a place of the Omnissiah, now fallen to the heretek’s corruption.’ Viola muttered a savage expletive, and Alcina silenced her with a snap. Akemi was still looking at the last set of numbers, consulting the dataslate she held in her hand. Mors had sagged against the wall, and was struggling to breathe. ‘Can we pass here?’ Alcina asked, her tone flat and unimpressed. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta ignored her second, and asked the obvious question. ‘Is there another route to the temple, or is this our only access?’ Akemi started to answer, but Alcina cut across her. ‘We must move swiftly. Our Sisters are dying while we dally.’ ‘And it will avail them nothing if we also perish,’ Augusta told her shortly. ‘We have been tasked with a mission, and the success of that mission is our only purpose. Akemi?’ Akemi said, ‘There is a final junction, to corridor zero-zero-one, but it is very long. And I am not certain of its success.’ Alcina restated, ‘Sister Superior, we do not have the time for this. We must pass here.’ ‘That decision is mine to take, Sister.’ Augusta’s tone was severe. ‘While offering our lives to the Golden Throne is the greatest honour a Sister may hope for, we are here to complete a mission.’ Alcina stepped forwards, her shoulders seeming to fill the tunnel. ‘It is my…’ she stopped herself, ‘…advice that we should seek passage at this point.’ Augusta did not permit herself the acid retort – such things were childish, left behind in the schola’s earliest years. But this was outright insubordination. She said, her tone flat, ‘You will do as you are commanded, Sister.’ Alcina loomed, her stance angry, but she did not push the point. Over a tight-beam channel on the vox, Melia’s voice said, ‘She is watching us. Waiting to see if we stumble.’ Augusta answered her, ‘I am aware of this. The witch touched us all too closely, and our loyalty is in question. Such doubt would insult both our honour and service, were it not based in reason. The success of this mission is imperative.’ ‘Aye.’ Melia said nothing more. At the front of the company, Rhea said, ‘Sisters, there is a way across the rift.’ Augusta turned back to the tunnel mouth. Beside her, leaning forwards over the gap, Viola muttered an epithet even more unsuitable than the first. ‘Enough,’ Augusta told her. A distance to their right, hung above the red glow like some narrow and suspended shadow, there was a walkway, the same black stone as the wall. Heavy chains, like a drawbridge, held it, but even from here they could see that the chains were sorely corroded. The fire lit its underside like pure, glowing hunger. ‘Sister Akemi,’ Augusta said, ‘can you give me a solid reason to not accept this alternative?’ ‘I fear not, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. Her voice carried the faintest twinge – guilt or regret – but she made no apology, and she faced the chasm without fear. Augusta paused, aware of the eyes of the others, awaiting her decision. She had a very clear memory of the demented inquisitor, leading the squad into ambushes, traps, and probable death. Propelled by her insane belief, Istrix had sacrificed not only her faith, but her very reason… ‘Very well,’ Augusta said. ‘Once again, He has shown us the way. Three times, we have paused, and three times, we have been blessed with His guidance. Let us continue.’ Rhea nodded, and Viola stepped back, hissing through her teeth. Akemi reattached the dataslate to her hip, and Augusta was aware of Mors and Rufus, shoulder to shoulder, and all but leaning on each other for strength. With their lighter gear, they had a better chance of reaching the far side than did the Sisters, however the heat and the fumes were taking a heavy toll upon them both. Rufus caught her looking, and offered her the sign of the aquila. ‘We will walk, Sister. We have no fear.’ ‘Aye,’ Augusta said. It was only as she offered the prayer for their courage and safety that she became aware of something else… At some point, while they’d been discussing how to proceed, the sound of gunfire had stopped.",

      "content": "CHAPTER EIGHT Somewhere in the darkness there moved weapons, and metal, and flesh. Sister Caia had seen the Lycheate machines before – the Breacher that had assaulted them upon their arrival, the kastelans that had answered to Rayos, and to Scafidis Zale. She had never seen anything like this. These things were horror-spawned, from the corrupt mind of the heretek. They were wrong, somehow – their weapons lopsided or crudely built, their bodies twisted, their feet or tracks dragging sparks that flashed like the meetings of wires. She knew little about machine-spirits, but her heart understood: these were abominations. The red lines of tanks had formed into an inverse arc, grouped before the now-open doorway. At the centre, now, the canoness stood in her Immolator with one hand aloft, holding back her troops’ desire to fire, and waiting for the enemy to fully reveal itself, sliding and grinding like corruption from the dark. More sounds came from above them – the defence ports were sliding open. But Nikaya and the Seraphim were waiting, their jump packs holding them tight to the rock face and out of range of fire. From the assembled Sisters, the unified words of the litany were like the threatening rumble of an avalanche – as if, once these machines entered the doorway itself, the might of the God-Emperor would bring the entire side of the mountain down upon them… But Rayos was not that foolish. Her force stopped, pausing just inside the cave’s huge mouth. It waited in the semi-dark, ragged and misshapen, listing and slumping, just as if the Ruinous Powers themselves had taken a hand in its formation. And a voice, so familiar to Sister Caia, echoed from the stone, from the metal, from the twitching, jerking skulls of the Breachers and Destroyers… ‘Sisters,’ Rayos’ voice said. It was logic-cold, yet it somehow seemed to hiss with that same thin, cold humour that Caia remembered from their previous meeting. ‘You have erred. There is an eighty-nine-point-eight per cent chance that you will lose this confrontation. You, with your faith, and your weak and human flesh.’ The canoness did not respond, except with the continuing thud and threat of the litany, booming like military drums. It echoed back from the mountainside. Caia’s hand tightened on her bolter, though it was her auspex that she watched. She said, quietly, ‘There are more of them, waiting out of our line of sight.’ Ianthe gave a single, grave nod. ‘Estimation of total numbers, Sister Caia.’ Caia replied, ‘Maybe two hundred and fifty individual units.’ ‘Their greatest concentration?’ ‘At the very rear.’ ‘Very well. Then let us finish this.’ Her shout came over the vox-coder, blasted through the pipes that still stood upon the top of her Immolator. ‘Immolators, Seraphim! Fire!’ And the Sisters’ wrath was loosed upon the enemy. Deep in the mountain tunnels, that first rumble of gunfire echoed like the boom of some distant heartbeat. Augusta felt Alcina, behind her, tense; heard Rhea catch her breath. Whatever happened down here, their Sisters were fighting and dying to give them time to achieve their goal. And they dared not falter. ‘We must move,’ she said, a thrum of urgency to her tone. ‘This mission will not permit us to dawdle.’ Beside her, Mors nodded. His nose and cheeks had taken scattered burn damage from the acid drizzle, but he’d made no complaint, and they had not stopped. Led only by Rhea’s scan and Akemi’s counting, they began to move more swiftly. The distant thunder of weapons continued, and the crackling of the empty vox told the Sister Superior, more clearly than any shout of urgency, that they could not afford to delay. She reviewed her new mission orders: once they had eliminated the force field, they were to retreat. The Kyrus would be beginning her countdown the moment she had a clear line of fire. The citadel was large enough that the massed tanks of the Order would survive… But Augusta’s squad were on foot. Offer your lives to the Emperor. She silenced the flicker of doubt with a flare of annoyance. Neither Mors nor Rufus had flinched, had shown the slightest fear. And she was Sororitas – if she were to perish in the line of her duty, then it would be with courage. Despite Istrix’s death, she would face the Golden Throne knowing she had died with her honour intact. If it were possible, however, she would uphold her responsibilities. Her squad were blameless, following her orders, and she would allow her Sisters to retreat, survive… Spare them Your wrath, she prayed. They have done nothing wrong. She would face her fate alone. Alone, or with these two young soldiers that had come so far. Akemi paused by another marker, and told them to turn left. They seemed to be moving in an arc, heading inwards, and still down. It was a long haul, but the corridors were steadily widening and the Sisters were beginning to watch for servitors, for skitarii, or for wherever Rayos may have left here to guard her main force. Yet still, there was nothing. If there were foot-troops, then perhaps they, too, had been mustered outside to face the canoness. And Ianthe would show them no mercy. Then Sister Rhea said, ‘Wait.’ In the silence of the corridor, they paused. The tunnels were still. Brass pipes ran like veins along their ceilings; wires clung to the stone, now bereft of information or power. The pict-screens flickered with vestiges of life, their half-formed data-ghosts striving to manifest. They sent odd, eerie lighting down the empty stone. Mors said, his deep voice quiet, ‘It’s still getting warmer–’ ‘The temperature has significantly risen,’ Sister Rhea confirmed, cutting him off. ‘I suspect there will be another lava flow ahead – a large one.’ ‘We are very close now,’ Akemi said. ‘The central forge temple lies ahead.’ In the distance, the boom and rattle of gunfire continued. ‘Do not pause,’ Sister Alcina said sternly. ‘Our Sisters fight for our time, and we must achieve our target.’ Alcina’s repetition was unnecessary, but Augusta said nothing. Her new second was not wrong, and the Sister Superior was beginning to suspect that there might be another reason why there were no defences down there. Rayos had no need of them. ‘Head right, then left, then right again,’ Akemi said. ‘Sister Rhea,’ Augusta commented. ‘You are familiar with the device that we seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister,’ Rhea said. ‘I do not possess Sister Akemi’s literacy, but I have seen such things before, on Mete, and the Mechanicus remain obsessively consistent. I will be able to shut down the force field.’ ‘We will proceed,’ Augusta said. ‘Walk swiftly, but with caution.’ ‘Aye.’ They moved onwards. Augusta could not read the machine dialect that was now flickering on the half-dead pict-screens, but she could see that the strings of binary were becoming shorter. Akemi was surely right – they were closing in on the central facility. Mors had pulled his face veil back up over his nose – the air was becoming more sulphurous. And Augusta was beginning to see it: the light was changing. Amid the flickers of the pict-screens, there was a deeper, steadier illumination, a soft red glow that was gradually growing stronger. The Sisters had seen this glow before. The ruddy colour of bare lava, somewhere ahead of them. Weapons roared alongside the vocal thunder of unified prayer. The air was thick with smoke and debris, with the flow and spark of living data, with the groaning and grinding of the strange, lopsided machines. Surrounded by the rage of battle, the Sisters’ tanks held their position. Their stationary formation was intended to pull Rayos’ forces out of the mountain, and then bring the stone down upon them, but Rayos was too wily, and her lines did not advance. Instead, her front rank opened fire. Caia, still standing behind the canoness in the lead Immolator, wondered why she did not deign to duck back inside the vehicle – but the moment Ianthe raised her pistol and opened fire herself, Caia understood. A streak of yellow light hit the end Breacher and its chest simply exploded, spattering its tracked base with gore. In the remaining mess, its exposed cogs spun for a startled second, and then were still. Caia opened her bolter to a full suppression, her rounds chewing holes in the next Breacher along. Its twisted human face showed no pain, no emotion, nothing – but it raised its shoulder and the weapon attached, and Caia knew that it would shoot straight at them. Ianthe sang the litany like a call of trumpets, and dared it to even consider the action. To either side of them, the surviving two Immolators were shooting with their heavy bolters, the weapons turning in suppression arcs. The two Repressors had remained still, waiting for the moment that the Order would roll forwards and into the cave mouth, but, for now, Ianthe was still holding them where they were. At the rear, the Exorcists were loaded and ready, but Rayos had been too clever. Calculating exactly the amount to raise the door, the arcing missiles did not have the necessary clearance, and their bolters could not shoot past the vehicles in the front. Above her, Caia was aware of the Seraphim, flitting across the rock face. With her focus on the enemy, she caught them from the corners of her vision, each one holding her place below a shielded gun port, then jumping upwards to shoot clean through the slit and eliminate the servitor, or gunner, that had been about to fire. Four of the Seraphim defeated their static targets with almost perfect flying manoeuvres; the fifth was less blessed. She missed, and the autocannon swivelled, catching her full in the chest. She spasmed backwards, then fell, plummeting with a streak of flame behind her. When she hit the ground, she crumpled like a broken thing. She did not move again. For a split second, Caia blinked at the broken corpse, appalled at how suddenly a Sister could perish, torn from the air and the battle with the brief blast of a weapon… But she stood before the Throne, her service completed. Blessed be her memory. Despite the loss, however, the Order was doing damage – the machines in the front were juddering under the heavy combined fire of the two Immolators and under the huge impacts of the canoness’ shooting. It was only as the first rank tumbled, however, that Caia realised they’d been bolter-fodder. And that the main attack was still to come. ‘Sisters,’ Akemi said. ‘We have reached corridor zero-zero-two, and the final junction. The side of the forge temple lies directly ahead.’ ‘Hold.’ Augusta’s command brought both Akemi and Rhea to a stop. Rhea, reflexively, responded, ‘Nothing moving, Sister, but the temperature is extreme.’ The squad had paused just short of the tunnel’s smooth and open mouth. Somewhere ahead of them, red light shone up from below, bathing the rock ceiling in a rich, ruddy sheen. Beside the Sister Superior, Mors was sagging, sheeted in sweat. His clothing was stained with it, but he still made no word of complaint. Rhea added, her voice soft in the vox, ‘Sisters, we have reached our goal.’ Domine deduc me mi Imperatoris… A prayer in her heart, Augusta moved forwards to see for herself. And stopped. Their tunnel opened out at the lip of a massive rift. No, not a rift, a chasm. A great, jagged moat that cracked clean down through the stone – an abyss from which the lava-light rose like fire, before losing itself in the vast darkness overhead. But that wasn’t all. By the Light! The Sister Superior held back the exclamation – she would show no fear, no doubt. But, out there ahead of her, on the far side of the rift, there rose a huge and mighty wall, black as basalt, and carved into vast square oriels and heavy, angled buttresses. It was clearly the wall of some immense cathedral, and yet it was layered with wheeled cogs, with folded cranes, with openings like vents and waste-chutes, and with colossal pipes, layered one upon another like a writhing mass of creeper. It stretched up and up, to the heights of the unseen roof, and down and down, far into the firepit below. The pipes’ metal glowed red with the heat, but by some Mechanicus wonder that she could not begin to comprehend, it had neither melted nor faltered – and it lit the great building with a glow like pure hellfire. ‘Forge temple,’ she said, not hiding the awe in her tone. ‘In His name, I could never have imagined one so huge. Truly, this is a place of the Omnissiah, now fallen to the heretek’s corruption.’ Viola muttered a savage expletive, and Alcina silenced her with a snap. Akemi was still looking at the last set of numbers, consulting the dataslate she held in her hand. Mors had sagged against the wall, and was struggling to breathe. ‘Can we pass here?’ Alcina asked, her tone flat and unimpressed. ‘Akemi,’ Augusta ignored her second, and asked the obvious question. ‘Is there another route to the temple, or is this our only access?’ Akemi started to answer, but Alcina cut across her. ‘We must move swiftly. Our Sisters are dying while we dally.’ ‘And it will avail them nothing if we also perish,’ Augusta told her shortly. ‘We have been tasked with a mission, and the success of that mission is our only purpose. Akemi?’ Akemi said, ‘There is a final junction, to corridor zero-zero-one, but it is very long. And I am not certain of its success.’ Alcina restated, ‘Sister Superior, we do not have the time for this. We must pass here.’ ‘That decision is mine to take, Sister.’ Augusta’s tone was severe. ‘While offering our lives to the Golden Throne is the greatest honour a Sister may hope for, we are here to complete a mission.’ Alcina stepped forwards, her shoulders seeming to fill the tunnel. ‘It is my…’ she stopped herself, ‘…advice that we should seek passage at this point.’ Augusta did not permit herself the acid retort – such things were childish, left behind in the schola’s earliest years. But this was outright insubordination. She said, her tone flat, ‘You will do as you are commanded, Sister.’ Alcina loomed, her stance angry, but she did not push the point. Over a tight-beam channel on the vox, Melia’s voice said, ‘She is watching us. Waiting to see if we stumble.’ Augusta answered her, ‘I am aware of this. The witch touched us all too closely, and our loyalty is in question. Such doubt would insult both our honour and service, were it not based in reason.

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Augusta did not see Rufus fall. In the continuous shimmer of the rising heat, the Sister Superior had done her best to watch both the ex-soldiers, their shoulders shaking now, their breathing straining with sulphur and exhaustion. But she could not be everywhere, and the shout from Melia made her turn. It was already too late. The young medicae made no sound; he did not have time. He was a tiny tumbling silhouette, black against the firelight below. And then he was a flash. And then he was gone. Augusta saw Mors stumble as the last member of his squad died before his eyes. ‘Decidit gloria.’ She answered his shock, his grief, with a gauntleted hand under his elbow, holding him up, with the words she’d learned when she’d seen for the first time a fellow Sister offer her life. Decidit gloria… Mors was shaking, she could feel it, but he took his own weight, picked the words up and repeated them, calm above the slavering heat. Fall with honour. Alcina gave a low impatient growl. ‘We must not pause here.’ A flare of ire rose in Augusta’s heart, just like the flare of fire they’d seen from below – they were warriors all, fighting servants of the God-Emperor, and they were stronger together. There was always a moment to find or pool their courage. Yet Alcina was right, they could not linger here. Augusta ended her prayer, glanced at Mors, and gave the order to go onwards. And so, with Rhea and Viola still at their head, they reached the end of the drawbridge, and the great, black wall that was Vastum’s central forge temple. ‘In times of fear,’ Augusta’s schola tutor had once told her, ‘you may rely upon two things. What are they? Your armour and your weapons? Yes? Anyone else have an answer? Your faith, Sisters, and your training.’ The old woman had been a warrior herself, and her lesson had stayed in Augusta’s heart – reflex was a powerful motivator. And now, as they moved carefully, skirmish formation, through a black stone archway and down through hollow corridors, she understood the wisdom of those words. Their faith was unquestioned, and it was manifest in every single one of these well-known actions, in the smooth operations of her assembled Sisters. Rhea and Viola worked well together – they had slotted into their roles as Sisters should. But Alcina… Augusta was aware of her second’s eyes, always upon her back. They made her itch. And that itch shamed her, despite its persistence – were they not all Sisters, in the service of the same light? They went onwards. Very soon, the corridor turned through an angle, the exact same sixty degrees as the outer tunnels – it seemed the temple, too, was crafted to hexagonal design. There were no numbers here, however, and Rhea and Akemi seemed to be moving on pure instinct, following the pipes and the stonework, as they headed for the building’s heart. As they moved on inwards, they began to encounter cloisters, though nothing like Augusta had known before. Great arcs of conduits surrounded hexagonal spaces, each one with a rusting metal shrine at the centre, and its cog-and-skull engraved in the underlying stone. In other places, short steps led them upwards, and great steel portcullises were long rusted into place. They hung above the Sisters’ heads like teeth, ready to descend. And then, at last, they came to the side door and the transept, and the heart of Vastum’s might and power. The place where that central control node would be waiting for them. Rifles, cannons, blasters. The bright-white glow of phosphor and the blossoming red detonations of high-calibre rounds. Half-hidden by the shadows of the doorway, the second rank of Rayos’ force laid down their fire. Caia’s auspex was telling her – though the canoness already knew – that they would not advance. But Ianthe was calling orders, pulling the Exorcists up, extended file, alongside the Immolators, and commanding the whole single rank to roll forwards, protecting the troop-bearers behind the advancing front. This was not a battle for infantry. Not yet. It was, however, a battle for the Seraphim. Down to four, the airborne Sisters swooped in under the edge of the door, and flew a straight strafing run all along the stationary line, each ­hammering down rounds from her twin bolters as she passed swiftly overhead. The line of machines did not react. It was not human, it could not flinch or be distracted – but the damage was being done. The Breachers and Destroyers, out at the flanks, were more vulnerable. Shots to their human heads took a severe toll, and already their fire was lessening. As the Seraphim reached the far end of the line, four of the waiting machines had been destroyed. And the red tanks rolled in, relentless, trumpets blaring from the vox-coder, towards the standing line of their foes. Any conscious enemy would surely have baulked, but the machines did not move. The canoness took cover, then shot a standing kastelan clean to the face, and watched it topple sideways, taking its nearest neighbour down with it. Blazing with righteousness, she targeted a second, and her streak of yellow fire struck its shoulder. It did not fall, but its cannon misfired and exploded, and sent a flash of light outwards through the black stone. It let Caia see one thing very clearly – the height of the roof. And it seemed Ianthe had seen it also. The canoness’ voice snapped the order, ‘Exorcists! Missiles, on my word!’ The greatest concentration of numbers was at the very back. Caia didn’t know if Rayos was here with her troops, or simply picking up the projected data as they fought, but wherever she was, she must surely be defended. Perhaps she was still human enough to wish to see this for herself. But the line of machines was still shooting, and the incoming barrage was taking a toll. Their own Immolator crunched and buckled at the impacts of heavy arc rifles and torsion cannons. One lopsided Kataphron was armed with a colossal plasma weapon – Caia had not seen its like before, but the glow of its power and the spit of its fire were tremendous. It struck one of the advancing Exorcists clean to the nose and the vehicle simply detonated, the blast immense in the enclosed space. Above the blast, one of the Seraphim was caught in the updraft, but she rode the current with extreme skill, came back down swooping at the Breacher and spattered its head across its metal shoulders. Still, the tanks rolled on. Still, the line facing them neither moved nor recoiled. Overhead, the arcs of the two surviving Exorcists’ missiles seemed like shooting stars in the darkness. And where they struck, the damage was immediate. Explosions rocked the cavern; Caia’s lenses flicked in their antidazzle as the confusion of noise and pressure almost knocked her back. The air was full of blood and smoke and oil and death. Still, the tanks did not stop. And as they reached full speed, the canoness shouted, ‘All drivers! Ram!’ Their own Immolator struck the legs of the kastelan before it. It was slow, like some lumbering giant; its great fist went to grab and crush them, but the strike missed as they rolled onwards. As it tried to balance and turn, the blast of Ianthe’s plasma pistol hit it in the side and it twisted into a complete fall, crushing the Breacher beside it to metal and pulp. In the vox, Caia could hear Sister Nikaya, the power of her hymn carrying her and the Seraphim forwards on another swoop-and-kill. They were sticking to the far flanks, out of the line of fire of the incoming vehicles. But another kastelan was ready for them. Sharper than its fellow, it timed Nikaya’s strafe and it met her, head-on, with one massive fist. Steel met steel; the jump pack coughed and guttered. At the noise, Ianthe’s voice caught on a furious crescendo. For a split second, nothing seemed to happen, Nikaya seemed to almost hang in the air… and then her jump pack flickered and went out completely, and she fell, down and down, and into the darkness. In the turmoil, Caia could not see where she’d landed, and the auspex was too confused to pick one contact out of the mess. The canoness was shouting, now, livid and furious, snapping orders of war and retribution. Rhene was moving, but Ianthe took a moment to bark, ‘No! Stay where you are! You are necessary and I cannot lose you!’ To Caia’s either side, the other two Immolators were still rumbling on, their heavy tracks carrying them insistently forward, and aiming their full rate of fire at the standing machines. They could hardly miss, and the machines were taking significant damage, but they were close, now, almost upon them. One of the Breachers coughed flame, but the fire fell back from the Immolator’s armour. The other one lowered its heavy cannon to shoot point-blank. The impact crunched the Immolator to a dead stop. Still shooting, straining to see, Caia thought that something had come loose from the front of the vehicle and was jammed in its tracks. The cannon was already powering up to shoot again, but the Breacher jerked and faltered under a hail of incoming rounds. ‘Their flesh is their weakness!’ Belatedly, Caia realised that the canoness had been giving commands for the last few moments. ‘Strike them in the head if you can!’ Fervently, Caia lifted her voice and continued to shoot, her smaller bolter seeming to do little damage. By contrast, the canoness’ pistol was ferocious, every hit a kill, every kill a celebration, every celebration a prayer. The second line of machines was almost down, and the Order was still moving, still pressing forwards. But Rayos, it seemed, had not finished with them yet. The forge temple was silent, and ruddy with the sullen glow of lava-light. It was a great vaulted hollow, cracked to the core, isolated by the yawning depths of its moat, and by the huge, hollow height of the mountain that encased it… and it carried an odd sense of unease that was making the Sister Superior sweat. ‘Rhea,’ Augusta said, her tone showing nothing of her tension. ‘Do you know what you seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Rhea sounded edgy, but she showed no hesitation. ‘We must find the focus of this building’s lost faith.’ ‘We will stay together,’ Augusta said. ‘I do not trust this place enough to split our strength. Viola, stay with Rhea. Akemi, Mors, with me. Alcina, Melia, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ The formation closed tight, weapons bristling in every direction. At Rhea’s indication, they headed through the transept for the wide space visible ahead. Still, they had seen no servitors, no guards, not so much as a cogitator or a floating servo-skull… But the sweat that slid down Augusta’s spine left a shudder as it passed. Unlike the headless corpse of the great cathedral upon Lautis, this space did not feel empty. It felt full, full of heat, full of potential and hostility, full of data, full of writhing streams of information that still moved across the air– It felt like it was watching them. ‘There.’ Rhea’s indication was unnecessary, they could all see the wide stone steps that led up to the central altar. It was not a stone plinth, a place of electro-candles and effigies; it looked more like a construction, a great layering of furnaces and walkways and steel steps, a tech-priest-made machine-spirit that should have been the Omnissiah’s strength on this, His distant world… But it lay dead, its furnaces cold, its walkways sagging. Like Lycheate itself. And then, a piece of it moved. The third rank of Rayos’ defences. Still no sign of the heretek herself, just her massed machines, line after line of them, ranks of foes that the Sisters must cut their way through. Yet these, Caia thought, looked different. They were clean-lined, and better made. They stood straight, their weapons strong. They lacked the writhing of wires, the exposed joints, the poorly made tracks, and the old welds across their steel bodies. Almost instinctively, Caia understood that the previous two ranks had been built in haste – that, for the weeks since the Sisters’ arrival, Rayos had been concentrating on massing her force. These machines had been made correctly, with more care, and time. As if they had been made by something– ‘These are older,’ the canoness said, finishing Caia’s thought. ‘Rayos could not have built–’ They did not have time to discuss the fact. The air was alive, and the massed machines were opening fire. Rayos. Augusta recognised the heretek from their previous mission – small, for a tech-priest, malign and misshapen. Her half-human face bore a slick of recent burn scars and one blue eye, and she wore a familiar black-shimmer cloak. She moved to the head of the steps as if she could deny the Sisters access to anything she chose. ‘Sister Superior,’ she said. Her voice, too, was recognisable, that same chill, analytical scorn. When Rayos spoke in human words, it felt like the heretek was lowering herself to the level of inferior beings. In response, Viola aimed the heavy bolter, the weapon the best answer she could give. Melia’s flamer gouted a belch of fire, as if it were eager for a second try. ‘Heretek,’ Augusta answered. The tech-priest shifted, clicking. ‘You have come far, Sisters. Two-hundred-point-one-four miles. We have watched you. We have calculated your every move. Your every response has been within expected parameters. And you have arrived precisely on schedule.’ Augusta was aware of Sister Rhea, auspex in hand, searching for the mechanism. She saw Rayos note the motion; saw the minute tilt of her head, its angle exact. It looked almost like amusement. ‘Your questing will avail you nothing,’ Rayos said. ‘You will perish here, all of you. And your weapons and equipment will be valuable.’ Augusta closed her hand on her chainsword. She wanted this over, wanted to slay this accursed heretek, but she dare not make a mistake. Alcina’s eyes were on her, and Rayos… The fallen tech-priest knew how to calculate the odds. She must know that she could not take on all six Sisters by herself. And she’d said, ‘we’. The Sister Superior came forwards, right to the bottom of the steps. She was looking for the concealed force, the gun emplacements, the backup or reinforcements that were giving Rayos this mathematical confidence. She said, pushing, ‘We are cutting your army to pieces.’ ‘Not my army, Sister,’ Rayos said. Again, that tilt of almost amusement. ‘My vanguard.’ What? Augusta felt Alcina tense; the clatter of her armour was audible. Rayos said, ‘You have erred. Your assault is destroyed. There is a ninety-four-point-eight per cent chance that your canoness will perish.’ ‘By the Light!’ Alcina’s voice. Her boots sounded on the stone. She was moving, but Augusta did not turn. The Sister Superior was fixed on Rayos at the top of the steps, her black cloak glistening like a living thing. ‘Your odds are nothing, heretek,’ Augusta said. ‘We will bring His light back to the darkness. Viola!’ The younger Sister shifted, and Augusta could feel her eagerness to fire – a crackle of faith and fury that defied the pure logic of the corrupted temple. One directed burst from the thrice-blessed heavy bolter would splatter Rayos’ remains across the forge-works behind her. Then something said, ‘Sororitas.’ The Order’s tanks were losing. Drawn forwards by the machines ahead, they had allowed a flanking manoeuvre to close in about them. Their line was enveloped at both ends, and they did not have the weapons to face a front that long. Still standing, still broadcasting righteousness and ferocity, the canoness was a one-woman army, the bright blasts of her plasma pistol taking down machine after machine. Caia stayed behind her, her smaller bolter seeming to do no damage, but she kept firing nonetheless. Another Immolator lost, another detonation that made after-images spark across the Sisters’ vision. And there were foot-troops, now, skitarii and servitors, faster than the lumbering machines and moving in close. But the Repressors, too, were firing – the Sisters inside were opening up through the weapon-ports even as the storm bolters on the vehicles’ tops moved to keep the skitarii at bay. As the foot-troops closed about the lead Immolator, the canoness was over the edge of the hatch and right in the middle of them, her chainsword now in her other hand and whipping through two of them at a time. She sent them toppling and reeling, sparking as they fell. She sang as she cut them to pieces, her voice incensed with fury. In her ten years of service, Caia had never seen anything fight like Elvorix Ianthe. She shot at them herself, those that were close enough – the battle was rapidly becoming a blur. The vehicles were still driving slowly forwards, clean over the top of anything foolish enough to get under their tracks, but the sheer weight of numbers was proving too much. Aloft, three Seraphim were changing tactics and picking careful targets – swooping in to alpha-strike a single machine and bring it down, and then moving onto the next. Steadily, they stopped one end of the line. But it was not enough. The canoness, in the vox: ‘Where are your squad, Sister Caia? They should have reached the temple!’ ‘I do not know!’ Caia had no answer, and could only pray. ‘I do not know!’ ‘Sororitas.’ The voice was rusted with age, strained with disuse. It made a shock of pure cold go down Augusta’s spine. Almost on top of them, something was moving. The Sister Superior turned, bringing blade and bolter to cover the motion. And stopped. By the Throne! The thing was big – huge – and it loomed like part of the shadows. As it shifted, it creaked and groaned as if it were somehow unused to motion. The temple’s sense of data, unseen in the air, coalesced about it like some invisible aura. Viola glanced, but she kept her heavy bolter on Rayos, ready to fire. ‘Hold your fire.’ Augusta’s command was swift. The new figure was strange, oddly hunched. It moved sideways, one step at a time, almost as if it were in pain. And it seemed wrong, somehow, twisted with age and rust. ‘Sororitas,’ it said, again. The word was a machine-whisper, a flicker through the empty temple. It was a hiss like a bellows, like the escaping of steam. It sounded as if it were decaying from the inside. Augusta stared. Watching it, she had a leap of understanding, a sudden sensation of everything making sense – as if the Emperor Himself had revealed to her the answer… She said, ‘Vius.’ The figure stopped. It said, its voice scraping, ‘Designation Incaladion Tech-priest Dominus 01-Vius.’ It wheezed like metal laughter, like fingernails rasping down a new set of armour. ‘Vastum belongs to me.’ ‘Vius.’ The echo was Akemi. ‘The inquisitor told us. After the Mechanicus abandoned Vastum, it was Vius who first landed–’ ‘That would make him two centuries old,’ Viola answered her sceptically. ‘Data – uploaded and preserved,’ Vius said. ‘Metal – worked and preserved. Only flesh falters. Incaladion awaits my return.’ ‘You want to go home,’ Augusta said. ‘That’s why everything still bears the Incaladion mark.’ Again, that rusted wheeze that might have been laughter. Unlike Rayos, Augusta could see no flesh upon this figure, nothing that remained of his once-human body. She wondered how he retained his emotions… such as they were. Humour… …and vengeance. ‘You will not leave here,’ she told him. Vius hissed. ‘You err, Sister Superior. Your every move has already been calculated. You are here to shut down the Emanatus field.’ ‘And what’s to stop us?’ Viola asked him, her tone harsh. ‘You?’ There was a long, full pause. In the far distance, the sound of gunfire had started up again. Vius twitched his metal skull to one side, a mocking parody of listening, and came further forwards, his huge frame looming over them. An odd heat radiated from his cloaked body. This close, he was genuinely daunting, his hunched figure far bigger than the Sister Superior, bigger even than Alcina, armour and all. And when he shrugged his multiple shoulders, letting his black cloak puddle to the ground, his vast array of limbs and weapons made him look like some colossal stalk-eyed insect, poised and ready to strike. The air of the temple seemed to move around him, ready to do his bidding. ‘Flesh is weak,’ he said. ‘You cannot reach the control panel. You will not leave here.’ He lifted one arm, and a surge of gunnery skulls rose with the motion, surrounding the Sisters with their broad and toothy grins. Rayos still stood at the top of the steps, and her cloak, too, had puddled to the floor. You cannot reach the control panel. You will not leave here. The heretek dominus would tear them all to screaming pieces.",

      "content": "CHAPTER NINE Augusta did not see Rufus fall. In the continuous shimmer of the rising heat, the Sister Superior had done her best to watch both the ex-soldiers, their shoulders shaking now, their breathing straining with sulphur and exhaustion. But she could not be everywhere, and the shout from Melia made her turn. It was already too late. The young medicae made no sound; he did not have time. He was a tiny tumbling silhouette, black against the firelight below. And then he was a flash. And then he was gone. Augusta saw Mors stumble as the last member of his squad died before his eyes. ‘Decidit gloria.’ She answered his shock, his grief, with a gauntleted hand under his elbow, holding him up, with the words she’d learned when she’d seen for the first time a fellow Sister offer her life. Decidit gloria… Mors was shaking, she could feel it, but he took his own weight, picked the words up and repeated them, calm above the slavering heat. Fall with honour. Alcina gave a low impatient growl. ‘We must not pause here.’ A flare of ire rose in Augusta’s heart, just like the flare of fire they’d seen from below – they were warriors all, fighting servants of the God-Emperor, and they were stronger together. There was always a moment to find or pool their courage. Yet Alcina was right, they could not linger here. Augusta ended her prayer, glanced at Mors, and gave the order to go onwards. And so, with Rhea and Viola still at their head, they reached the end of the drawbridge, and the great, black wall that was Vastum’s central forge temple. ‘In times of fear,’ Augusta’s schola tutor had once told her, ‘you may rely upon two things. What are they? Your armour and your weapons? Yes? Anyone else have an answer? Your faith, Sisters, and your training.’ The old woman had been a warrior herself, and her lesson had stayed in Augusta’s heart – reflex was a powerful motivator. And now, as they moved carefully, skirmish formation, through a black stone archway and down through hollow corridors, she understood the wisdom of those words. Their faith was unquestioned, and it was manifest in every single one of these well-known actions, in the smooth operations of her assembled Sisters. Rhea and Viola worked well together – they had slotted into their roles as Sisters should. But Alcina… Augusta was aware of her second’s eyes, always upon her back. They made her itch. And that itch shamed her, despite its persistence – were they not all Sisters, in the service of the same light? They went onwards. Very soon, the corridor turned through an angle, the exact same sixty degrees as the outer tunnels – it seemed the temple, too, was crafted to hexagonal design. There were no numbers here, however, and Rhea and Akemi seemed to be moving on pure instinct, following the pipes and the stonework, as they headed for the building’s heart. As they moved on inwards, they began to encounter cloisters, though nothing like Augusta had known before. Great arcs of conduits surrounded hexagonal spaces, each one with a rusting metal shrine at the centre, and its cog-and-skull engraved in the underlying stone. In other places, short steps led them upwards, and great steel portcullises were long rusted into place. They hung above the Sisters’ heads like teeth, ready to descend. And then, at last, they came to the side door and the transept, and the heart of Vastum’s might and power. The place where that central control node would be waiting for them. Rifles, cannons, blasters. The bright-white glow of phosphor and the blossoming red detonations of high-calibre rounds. Half-hidden by the shadows of the doorway, the second rank of Rayos’ force laid down their fire. Caia’s auspex was telling her – though the canoness already knew – that they would not advance. But Ianthe was calling orders, pulling the Exorcists up, extended file, alongside the Immolators, and commanding the whole single rank to roll forwards, protecting the troop-bearers behind the advancing front. This was not a battle for infantry. Not yet. It was, however, a battle for the Seraphim. Down to four, the airborne Sisters swooped in under the edge of the door, and flew a straight strafing run all along the stationary line, each ­hammering down rounds from her twin bolters as she passed swiftly overhead. The line of machines did not react. It was not human, it could not flinch or be distracted – but the damage was being done. The Breachers and Destroyers, out at the flanks, were more vulnerable. Shots to their human heads took a severe toll, and already their fire was lessening. As the Seraphim reached the far end of the line, four of the waiting machines had been destroyed. And the red tanks rolled in, relentless, trumpets blaring from the vox-coder, towards the standing line of their foes. Any conscious enemy would surely have baulked, but the machines did not move. The canoness took cover, then shot a standing kastelan clean to the face, and watched it topple sideways, taking its nearest neighbour down with it. Blazing with righteousness, she targeted a second, and her streak of yellow fire struck its shoulder. It did not fall, but its cannon misfired and exploded, and sent a flash of light outwards through the black stone. It let Caia see one thing very clearly – the height of the roof. And it seemed Ianthe had seen it also. The canoness’ voice snapped the order, ‘Exorcists! Missiles, on my word!’ The greatest concentration of numbers was at the very back. Caia didn’t know if Rayos was here with her troops, or simply picking up the projected data as they fought, but wherever she was, she must surely be defended. Perhaps she was still human enough to wish to see this for herself. But the line of machines was still shooting, and the incoming barrage was taking a toll. Their own Immolator crunched and buckled at the impacts of heavy arc rifles and torsion cannons. One lopsided Kataphron was armed with a colossal plasma weapon – Caia had not seen its like before, but the glow of its power and the spit of its fire were tremendous. It struck one of the advancing Exorcists clean to the nose and the vehicle simply detonated, the blast immense in the enclosed space. Above the blast, one of the Seraphim was caught in the updraft, but she rode the current with extreme skill, came back down swooping at the Breacher and spattered its head across its metal shoulders. Still, the tanks rolled on. Still, the line facing them neither moved nor recoiled. Overhead, the arcs of the two surviving Exorcists’ missiles seemed like shooting stars in the darkness. And where they struck, the damage was immediate. Explosions rocked the cavern; Caia’s lenses flicked in their antidazzle as the confusion of noise and pressure almost knocked her back. The air was full of blood and smoke and oil and death. Still, the tanks did not stop. And as they reached full speed, the canoness shouted, ‘All drivers! Ram!’ Their own Immolator struck the legs of the kastelan before it. It was slow, like some lumbering giant; its great fist went to grab and crush them, but the strike missed as they rolled onwards. As it tried to balance and turn, the blast of Ianthe’s plasma pistol hit it in the side and it twisted into a complete fall, crushing the Breacher beside it to metal and pulp. In the vox, Caia could hear Sister Nikaya, the power of her hymn carrying her and the Seraphim forwards on another swoop-and-kill. They were sticking to the far flanks, out of the line of fire of the incoming vehicles. But another kastelan was ready for them. Sharper than its fellow, it timed Nikaya’s strafe and it met her, head-on, with one massive fist. Steel met steel; the jump pack coughed and guttered. At the noise, Ianthe’s voice caught on a furious crescendo. For a split second, nothing seemed to happen, Nikaya seemed to almost hang in the air… and then her jump pack flickered and went out completely, and she fell, down and down, and into the darkness. In the turmoil, Caia could not see where she’d landed, and the auspex was too confused to pick one contact out of the mess. The canoness was shouting, now, livid and furious, snapping orders of war and retribution. Rhene was moving, but Ianthe took a moment to bark, ‘No! Stay where you are! You are necessary and I cannot lose you!’ To Caia’s either side, the other two Immolators were still rumbling on, their heavy tracks carrying them insistently forward, and aiming their full rate of fire at the standing machines. They could hardly miss, and the machines were taking significant damage, but they were close, now, almost upon them. One of the Breachers coughed flame, but the fire fell back from the Immolator’s armour. The other one lowered its heavy cannon to shoot point-blank. The impact crunched the Immolator to a dead stop. Still shooting, straining to see, Caia thought that something had come loose from the front of the vehicle and was jammed in its tracks. The cannon was already powering up to shoot again, but the Breacher jerked and faltered under a hail of incoming rounds. ‘Their flesh is their weakness!’ Belatedly, Caia realised that the canoness had been giving commands for the last few moments. ‘Strike them in the head if you can!’ Fervently, Caia lifted her voice and continued to shoot, her smaller bolter seeming to do little damage. By contrast, the canoness’ pistol was ferocious, every hit a kill, every kill a celebration, every celebration a prayer. The second line of machines was almost down, and the Order was still moving, still pressing forwards. But Rayos, it seemed, had not finished with them yet. The forge temple was silent, and ruddy with the sullen glow of lava-light. It was a great vaulted hollow, cracked to the core, isolated by the yawning depths of its moat, and by the huge, hollow height of the mountain that encased it… and it carried an odd sense of unease that was making the Sister Superior sweat. ‘Rhea,’ Augusta said, her tone showing nothing of her tension. ‘Do you know what you seek?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Rhea sounded edgy, but she showed no hesitation. ‘We must find the focus of this building’s lost faith.’ ‘We will stay together,’ Augusta said. ‘I do not trust this place enough to split our strength. Viola, stay with Rhea. Akemi, Mors, with me. Alcina, Melia, watch our backs.’ ‘Aye.’ The formation closed tight, weapons bristling in every direction. At Rhea’s indication, they headed through the transept for the wide space visible ahead. Still, they had seen no servitors, no guards, not so much as a cogitator or a floating servo-skull… But the sweat that slid down Augusta’s spine left a shudder as it passed. Unlike the headless corpse of the great cathedral upon Lautis, this space did not feel empty. It felt full, full of heat, full of potential and hostility, full of data, full of writhing streams of information that still moved across the air– It felt like it was watching them. ‘There.’ Rhea’s indication was unnecessary, they could all see the wide stone steps that led up to the central altar. It was not a stone plinth, a place of electro-candles and effigies; it looked more like a construction, a great layering of furnaces and walkways and steel steps, a tech-priest-made machine-spirit that should have been the Omnissiah’s strength on this, His distant world… But it lay dead, its furnaces cold, its walkways sagging. Like Lycheate itself. And then, a piece of it moved. The third rank of Rayos’ defences. Still no sign of the heretek herself, just her massed machines, line after line of them, ranks of foes that the Sisters must cut their way through. Yet these, Caia thought, looked different. They were clean-lined, and better made. They stood straight, their weapons strong. They lacked the writhing of wires, the exposed joints, the poorly made tracks, and the old welds across their steel bodies. Almost instinctively, Caia understood that the previous two ranks had been built in haste – that, for the weeks since the Sisters’ arrival, Rayos had been concentrating on massing her force. These machines had been made correctly, with more care, and time. As if they had been made by something– ‘These are older,’ the canoness said, finishing Caia’s thought. ‘Rayos could not have built–’ They did not have time to discuss the fact. The air was alive, and the massed machines were opening fire. Rayos. Augusta recognised the heretek from their previous mission – small, for a tech-priest, malign and misshapen. Her half-human face bore a slick of recent burn scars and one blue eye, and she wore a familiar black-shimmer cloak. She moved to the head of the steps as if she could deny the Sisters access to anything she chose. ‘Sister Superior,’ she said. Her voice, too, was recognisable, that same chill, analytical scorn. When Rayos spoke in human words, it felt like the heretek was lowering herself to the level of inferior beings. In response, Viola aimed the heavy bolter, the weapon the best answer she could give. Melia’s flamer gouted a belch of fire, as if it were eager for a second try. ‘Heretek,’ Augusta answered. The tech-priest shifted, clicking. ‘You have come far, Sisters. Two-hundred-point-one-four miles. We have watched you. We have calculated your every move. Your every response has been within expected parameters. And you have arrived precisely on schedule.’ Augusta was aware of Sister Rhea, auspex in hand, searching for the mechanism. She saw Rayos note the motion; saw the minute tilt of her head, its angle exact. It looked almost like amusement. ‘Your questing will avail you nothing,’ Rayos said. ‘You will perish here, all of you. And your weapons and equipment will be valuable.’ Augusta closed her hand on her chainsword. She wanted this over, wanted to slay this accursed heretek, but she dare not make a mistake. Alcina’s eyes were on her, and Rayos… The fallen tech-priest knew how to calculate the odds. She must know that she could not take on all six Sisters by herself. And she’d said, ‘we’.

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN There were no pews, nothing that could offer the squad good cover. And the heretek dominus knew it. His limbs were widely deployed with a horrific selection of weaponry – a vintage stubber, a steel axe, other things that Augusta did not recognise. She was already turning away, barking orders, telling her Sisters to spread out and flank him– A bright ball of energy struck her full in the chest and stuck there, like some guiding light. And every skull in the temple opened fire, aiming at the illuminated spot. Her armour denting under the onslaught, Augusta was battered backwards, her feet skidding on the stone. She raised her bolter. But Viola had just been waiting for the chance. Switching targets, and with a prayer like a paean, she hit the heretek dominus with the full rate of fire of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter. It did nothing. Static crackled about his frame, a flashing wash of brilliance that simply stopped the rounds in mid-air. They hit, detonated, surrounded him in a corona of fire… But they did not touch his metal body. Swearing, she tried again. Seeing the force field, however, Augusta was already changing her orders. She was unhurt, but her armour was dented hard enough to restrict her breathing; she checked for cracks in the floor, faults in the ceiling, anything that Viola could shoot that was not the tech-priest himself. But Vius was too cunning, and he was moving too swiftly. One strike of the axe took Viola’s feet from under her and she crashed over sideways, her armour crunching as she hit the floor. Augusta shouted, ‘Melia! Take Rhea, and target Rayos! Find this mechanism! The rest of you, the skulls!’ ‘Aye!’ Both Sisters ran for the steps. The temple was filled with noise – the crash of metal boots on stone, the hammer and blast of bolter fire, the chiming rise of anger and song. The skulls hovered and faltered and fell, echoing hollowly as they cracked against the floor. But, even as Augusta turned her attention back to the heretek, they were rising again, answering to the endless data-stream of Vius’ commands. Augusta barked, ‘Concentrate your fire, Sisters! Keep them down!’ Bolters thundered. The heretek dominus had been right about one thing – if they did not bring him down, and swiftly, then they would not be able to deactivate the field. And if that happened… Focused now, Augusta freed her chainsword. Rasping it to full motion, she took one skull, then a second, clean out of the air. As one of them twitched back to life, she brought her boot down upon it, smashing it. She was shouting in the vox, ‘Rhea!’ and sparing the briefest of glances for the top of the steps. Framed by the lava-gleam of the forge-works, Rhea and Melia had parted to flank Rayos. The younger tech-priest’s movements were swift and fluid, her claws and tools keeping both Sisters back. She had been hit by Melia’s flamer once before, and was staying well out of its range. But Augusta had no time to bark further orders – Vius was still moving, now focused on Viola as the greatest threat. Even as the younger Sister rolled back to her feet, the axe struck her again, hard across the belly. Vius’ strength was incredible. Viola’s chestplate cracked clean through, and her breath whooshed out of her lungs. Her song fell from the air. Halfway to her feet, she went over once more, metal screeching on stone as she skidded backwards across the floor. Augusta’s sword took out another skull. ‘Rhea!’ Rhea’s voice in the vox: ‘I have it! It’s up there, Sister, behind the altar! It’s the pull switch on the right! We…’ Her words suddenly faltered, then faded to a crushed softness, like pure horror. ‘By the Light, he’s right. We cannot reach it.’ ‘What?’ Augusta took a split second to look, and to see what the Sister had meant. Along the back wall of the temple, high above the forge-works of the altar, there ran a steel gantry. It allowed a priest or servitor access to an array of prayer-screens, diagnostics, switches, levers, and gauges. But to reach it… To reach it, they would have to ascend a narrow metal ladder, covered by a cylindrical cage. Rhea – or Akemi – might have been able to fit through the cage’s gap… But not in full armour. And Rayos was still in the way. You will not… Augusta felt her heart freeze. Her mind turned over options – could she cut through it, perhaps? Could they occupy Vius and Rayos for long enough for one of the lighter Sisters to drop her wargear? But she knew the answer – Vius had anticipated this, all of this. The heretek dominus had calculated his ploy flawlessly, knowing they were helpless, drawing them in. So he could kill them all. A prayer formed in her heart, almost like a plea. She did not get the time to voice it. Vius lowered one limb, and there was a flare of rippling heat. Viola screamed in the vox, a noise that made Augusta’s hair stand on end. She did not move again. Without pause, he turned the arm on Akemi. Again, the air shimmered. She reeled backwards, throwing up her arms, then staggered and fell. Thin smoke stole from the joints in her armour. Dominica’s eyes! Augusta mouthed a horrified curse. Alcina, spitting the words of the litany, strode forwards as if she would take Vius apart with her gauntleted hands. At the top of the steps there was a burst of flame and a semi-mechanical hiss. The Sister Superior did not dare look. They were out of time; the squad was being taken to pieces. But they had to take down that force field, even if it cost them their lives. Our Emperor, deliver us! By the Light – Vius had known this, all of this. From the beginning, he’d known their numbers, their deployments, their plans. He had extrapolated their every move with the efficiency of pure critical analysis. Nothing they had done had surprised him, and here he was, at the last, mocking them with their failure. Knowing that he could take them down, one at a time, and that they could not touch him. That they could not reach the force field. That they must leave their Order to die. But there was no room for hopelessness, no option for despair. They would succeed, or they would perish trying. With unspoken agreement, Augusta and Alcina parted to divide Vius’ targeting, but the heretek dominus was pure, metallic symmetry, insectile and graceful, unassailable. Two-handed, now, Augusta slashed at his weapon arm with the running chainsword, but the effect was the same – the field sparked with energy and the blade simply bounced, the after-shock travelling up her arm. Alcina was still shooting, firing single shots at Vius’ back, but to no effect. She was knotted with anger, fearsome and furious. In the clash and the clatter, Augusta realised Alcina was a truly powerful fighter. But it was not enough. They had no weapon that could touch him, no way of reaching that switch. They were going to fail, not only themselves but the entirety of their Order… And then, Augusta realised something, like a shaft of pure light striking down through the red glow of the temple. His touch, in the heart of the heretek’s corrupted power. An answer. The thing that Vius had missed, the one variable that he had not calculated. The single member of this force that was not supposed to be here. Mors. As the realisation hit her, she flared with hope and defiance. She gave the squad a single command – alpha strike! – to concentrate everything they had on Rayos at the top of the steps. They had to get her out of the way. She said to Mors, ‘Can you get up there? Pull that switch?’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Mors didn’t argue, and he didn’t waste time. He slung his rifle – he’d need both hands to climb – then ran for the altar. They both knew that as soon as either tech-priest saw him, he was dead. It was just a matter of time. Howling, Augusta drove at Vius with the chainsword, battering him back, holding his attention. Vius hissed. He seemed to retract into himself, then he lashed back out again like some coiled spring, that huge axe hammering with incredible mechanical force. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the flare of Melia’s flamer, saw Rayos go over; she saw Mors reach the ladder and swing himself onto it with a wiry and long-limbed strength. He shot upwards, in and under the cage, then out and onto the gantry. As his boots banged on the metal walkway, Vius turned. Augusta saw the tech-priest pause, saw his shock, saw all his limbs shift to aim at the running figure. She could taste his dismay, his split-second understanding of his error. The one thing he had not calculated. The thing that was about to bring him down. Vius raised the heat-weapon. Mors threw himself at the switch. The Sister Superior had barely a moment to understand that he’d made it, before the air of the temple shimmered. And Mors died instantly, in a hiss of superheated steam, much like Rufus had done. At the cave mouth, Captain Mulier’s words came through Caia’s vox-bead: ‘The field is down. Countdown begins at ninety… Eighty-nine…’ ‘Retreat!’ Even as the canoness gave the order, she was up and over the side of the Immolator. In the smoke and the noise, Caia heard the rumble as the vehicles started to turn. But there were machines still standing. The Sisters’ force had cut scores of them down and the canoness herself had slain too many to count. Still aloft, the three remaining Sera­phim covered the retreat – as the tanks turned, the airborne Sisters swooped and hammered, keeping the foes’ ranks back. Caia hung on as the Immolator reached full speed. Looking around, she counted the remaining tanks – one surviving Immolator, as well as their own, both Repressors, two Exorcists. If she glanced back, she could see the two fallen Seraphim, still and broken – her Sisters, fallen in battle, and never to be recovered. She offered a silent prayer, but the canoness was still barking orders. ‘Roll call!’ The responses were coming in – Eleni, Roku, Jolantra. Briefly, Caia wondered about her own squad. She offered her thanks for their success, and prayed that they were still standing. Behind them, the machines lumbered forwards. If they had previous orders not to leave the cavern, those orders had been superseded; as the tanks came out into the open and ­thundered, full-speed, back down towards the beach, the rattle and rumble of the mobile force followed them, harrying them all the way. In the back of the Immolator, Ianthe prayed, her words rising to the brass-clouded sky. Up there, somewhere, Captain Mulier was getting ready to fire. Ninety seconds. Augusta had not heard the broadcast, but she knew. And she knew that they would not have time. At the top of the steps, Rayos was down – her fallen form was smouldering under the burned remains of her cloak. This time, it seemed, Sister Melia had finished the task. But Vius was still upright, still fighting. And, though it would be the last thing she did, Augusta was going to take the heretek dominus down before the Kyrus killed them all. ‘Alcina!’ She barked the order. ‘Take the squad and go! Get clear if you can!’ Despite his failure, Vius was still focused, calculated and cold. His combat strikes remained implacable, relentless, one after another… Slash, slash, slash. Systematically, he pursued Augusta with the axe, constantly reversing his grip so he could strike from both sides. She snarled at him, parrying the blows, her arms jarring, her feet skidding, her chainsword reaching a high-pitched scream as the teeth caught on the axe-haft. In his other hands, targeting flawlessly, the stubber and the heat weapon still struck out at the squad. From somewhere, Rhea was shouting something, her tone urgent, but Augusta did not hear her, she was intent on Vius, looking for the opening, trying to get a strike through the tech-priest’s thought-swift defences. She was aware of the shimmer of the heat-weapon, of a dive-and-clatter as a figure in red armour rolled out of the way. And then, something in her crystallised – pure concentrated rage. In that split second, time seemed to slow. Her heart rate became a booming bass thrum in her ears; a new strength uncurled like light through her limbs. She would pay this heretek for every life he had taken, for her fallen Sisters, for Rufus, and for Mors. She would pay him for thinking he could take down her squad, and mock the Adepta Sororitas. Domine, libra nos! Despite the force field, she was gaining ground, pushing him back. The repeated strikes of the chainsword seemed to flow from her like pure song, like she had become a conduit for the entire fury of her Order. He was parrying almost frantically, sparks flying from the axe-haft. Alcina had not left; she was kneeling beside the fallen Viola. She, too, was shouting, but Augusta could not hear through the roar of blood in her ears. The Sister Superior was reciting the words of the litany like a drum-pulse chant, rhythmic and furious with the systematic, relentless attacks of the chainsword. She let her rage fill her with pure scarlet light, with the fire that was battle-focus and absolute certainty – this thing would die. Vius switched his axe again, striking from the other side. As he did so, she slammed it with her foot and knocked it sideways – he missed the blow and paused, just for a moment, but it was enough. There – there! – was the opening she sought! She slammed with the chainsword straight through his defences; his force field sparked and failed. The blade bit home, screaming its song of destruction. It was not enough to kill him, but his defences were down, now, and he could not free himself enough to move. He hissed at her, all his limbs mantling high over her shoulders… But it was too late. Alcina was moving; Rhea and Melia were still on their feet. Her Sisters had not left her. And they did the rest. Black ash, billowing in a bitter, metallic wind. This was the limit of the tanks’ retreat – the roadway was collapsed and they could not leave the island. The last of the machines were still behind them, lumbering down the road like monsters of nightmare, but they were not fast enough. Ianthe shoved herself and Caia both into the Immolator’s belly, and slammed the hatch. Over the vox, the canoness offered a prayer. And from the clouds, there came the pure white blaze of the Emperor’s light.",

      "content": "CHAPTER TEN There were no pews, nothing that could offer the squad good cover. And the heretek dominus knew it. His limbs were widely deployed with a horrific selection of weaponry – a vintage stubber, a steel axe, other things that Augusta did not recognise. She was already turning away, barking orders, telling her Sisters to spread out and flank him– A bright ball of energy struck her full in the chest and stuck there, like some guiding light. And every skull in the temple opened fire, aiming at the illuminated spot. Her armour denting under the onslaught, Augusta was battered backwards, her feet skidding on the stone. She raised her bolter. But Viola had just been waiting for the chance. Switching targets, and with a prayer like a paean, she hit the heretek dominus with the full rate of fire of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter. It did nothing. Static crackled about his frame, a flashing wash of brilliance that simply stopped the rounds in mid-air. They hit, detonated, surrounded him in a corona of fire… But they did not touch his metal body. Swearing, she tried again. Seeing the force field, however, Augusta was already changing her orders. She was unhurt, but her armour was dented hard enough to restrict her breathing; she checked for cracks in the floor, faults in the ceiling, anything that Viola could shoot that was not the tech-priest himself. But Vius was too cunning, and he was moving too swiftly. One strike of the axe took Viola’s feet from under her and she crashed over sideways, her armour crunching as she hit the floor. Augusta shouted, ‘Melia! Take Rhea, and target Rayos! Find this mechanism! The rest of you, the skulls!’ ‘Aye!’ Both Sisters ran for the steps. The temple was filled with noise – the crash of metal boots on stone, the hammer and blast of bolter fire, the chiming rise of anger and song. The skulls hovered and faltered and fell, echoing hollowly as they cracked against the floor. But, even as Augusta turned her attention back to the heretek, they were rising again, answering to the endless data-stream of Vius’ commands. Augusta barked, ‘Concentrate your fire, Sisters! Keep them down!’ Bolters thundered. The heretek dominus had been right about one thing – if they did not bring him down, and swiftly, then they would not be able to deactivate the field. And if that happened… Focused now, Augusta freed her chainsword. Rasping it to full motion, she took one skull, then a second, clean out of the air. As one of them twitched back to life, she brought her boot down upon it, smashing it. She was shouting in the vox, ‘Rhea!’ and sparing the briefest of glances for the top of the steps. Framed by the lava-gleam of the forge-works, Rhea and Melia had parted to flank Rayos. The younger tech-priest’s movements were swift and fluid, her claws and tools keeping both Sisters back. She had been hit by Melia’s flamer once before, and was staying well out of its range. But Augusta had no time to bark further orders – Vius was still moving, now focused on Viola as the greatest threat. Even as the younger Sister rolled back to her feet, the axe struck her again, hard across the belly. Vius’ strength was incredible. Viola’s chestplate cracked clean through, and her breath whooshed out of her lungs. Her song fell from the air.

      "content": "CHAPTER ELEVEN Rubble. It steamed in extreme heat; smoke and dirt billowed over its charred and mountainous ruin. But the tanks remained, tiny red fortresses at the edge of the destruction. Rayos’ machines had not been so blessed. Too slow, they had been caught by the wave of devastation. They lay twisted and blackened, their flesh melted, their metal crushed. A few had survived, but they had been easy to despatch. In the belly of the Immolator, the canoness was offering her thanks for His protection. Surrounded by the tank’s metal walls, Caia sat by Sister Rhene, her helm off, and swallowing tears – though there was no shame in grief, now the battle was over. Rhene sat with her, the old Hospitaller’s voice gentle. She said, ‘Your Sisters died with honour, Caia de Musa. They stand before the Golden Throne, and they stand blessed. They have succeeded in their mission, and shown great courage.’ ‘I know,’ Caia nodded, though she could say no more. Rhene touched her knee, gentle, like an elderly aunt. ‘I have seen many things, Sister Caia – battles and horrors, the rot and disease of the deepest mines, creations of warp and Ruin. I understand that there are greater wounds than battle injuries – and I know He sees them also. You worship Him with warfare, but to me, He is a figure of great healing. His peace be upon you, and His light in your soul.’ ‘Sometimes,’ the canoness said softly, ‘it takes more courage to survive. Fear not, Sister Caia, He has a plan for you. And He knows where you will–’ ‘Please, milady!’ At the canoness’ words, Caia looked up, her grief suddenly congealing into a cold and absolute dread. She had known, all along, that this was coming, known that the canoness had another plan for her. She said, ‘Please don’t expel me from the Order!’ Ianthe blinked. She should discipline Caia significantly, but she seemed almost confused. ‘Expel you, Sister?’ ‘I’m a warrior, your eminence. Have I not proven–’ ‘And why would you be anything else?’ There was a distinct note of warning in Ianthe’s tone. Caught, Caia paused, looking from canoness to Hospitaller and back. She said, the words falling over themselves, ‘Please, milady, my bloodline is too faint. I’m a second cousin of a second cousin, a grand-niece of a grand-niece. I know nothing of Spire politics. I could never be–’ ‘You forget yourself, Sister.’ The snap was back in the canoness’ voice. ‘I comprehend your grief, and I share it – but you will control your outbursts.’ ‘Milady.’ Caia inhaled, steadying herself, then let out a slow breath. During the battle, Ianthe had lost her distant, austere manner, and had become a figure of great passion and strength. Now, she returned to her unquestioned cold authority, and Caia, slightly belatedly, remembered her place. She lowered her gaze, ‘Your eminence.’ Rhene cackled, and patted Caia’s knee again. ‘You’ve conjured this dread for yourself, Sister Caia,’ she said. ‘Fear not, I do not see you in a decorous robe. Look at the state of you – the Orders Famulous would never accept a Sister so downright grubby.’ She continued to cackle, and Caia, feeling immensely foolish, lowered her head in a prayer. Augusta’s squad was a mess. Guided by Sister Rhea’s experiences upon Mete, carrying their injured Sisters, they had taken shelter in the depths of the librarium, a place of vast and crumbling data-banks, of Vastum’s rotting knowledge and forgotten resources. As the countdown had measured their lives in remaining seconds, they’d almost fallen down the long stairway and then, with a desperate prayer, they’d thrown themselves on the floor. And He had heard them. Shielded by the ancient Mechanicus’ stone and wisdom, scattered with falling dust and debris, the squad had survived the blast. Battered, exhausted and filthy, Augusta had offered a hymn to His foresight and mercy, and a prayer of thanks for the miracle. It seemed He was not ready to call them to the Throne – not yet. They’d stumbled through half-collapsed corridors, through rubble and rock and dust; they’d almost crawled, half-blind, over the burned-black stone, and at last, they’d found the beach where the tanks stood waiting. The canoness, Sister Caia with her, had come to meet them. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Augusta.’ ‘Ave Imperator, your eminence.’ At the limits of her endurance, Augusta pulled herself to her full height and returned the salute. She had Akemi over her shoulder; Viola was semi-conscious and being half-carried, half-dragged by Alcina and Melia; Rhea had Viola’s weapon as well as her own. ‘Sister Rhene will see to your injured,’ Ianthe said, indicating the Immolator. ‘Report.’ Right there, on the desolate black beach, the smoking ruin of the citadel behind her, Augusta gave that report. Her words were clipped, efficient, but aching with weariness. But when she reached the final battle, and the presence of the heretek dominus, Sister Alcina stepped forwards to stop her. ‘Permission to speak, milady,’ she said. ‘Granted,’ Ianthe answered. ‘Your eminence,’ Alcina said. ‘My orders were to report on the performance of Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, and of her squad. To assess whether the witch Scafidis Zale had left any touch of Ruin upon them, and to analyse their operation in the field.’ Augusta said nothing; she had known this was coming. But the fact that Alcina had spoken it openly… The canoness, it seemed, had drawn the same conclusion. ‘I take it, Sister Alcina, that your report is positive?’ ‘It is positive,’ Alcina said. ‘There is no touch of Ruin upon these Sisters, and they have conducted this mission with great courage.’ ‘And what of the deserter? Mors?’ ‘Both soldiers,’ Alcina said, ‘gave their lives, with honour, in the service of the Emperor.’ She made no attempt to explain further. Ianthe nodded, her eyes still scanning Augusta. Augusta noticed that she, too, was filthy, her armour dented, her face and hair covered in smears and grit. Caia, likewise, her armour dirty and battered with impacts. ‘I am glad,’ Ianthe said, at last. ‘Glad that He has blessed you, Sister Superior. You are warriors born, all of you, and I am proud to call you my Sisters. He has blessed us all, this day – we have achieved our mission, slain both the tech-priest and her collaborator, and prevented their corrupted army from leaving this world. We have survived, Sisters, and we will return to the Convent Sanctorum to give our thanks.’ She cast a rueful eyebrow at the beach and the fallen roadway. ‘Though,’ she said, ‘I fear that may be a while. It seems He still has work for us to do.’",

      "content": "CHAPTER ELEVEN Rubble. It steamed in extreme heat; smoke and dirt billowed over its charred and mountainous ruin. But the tanks remained, tiny red fortresses at the edge of the destruction. Rayos’ machines had not been so blessed. Too slow, they had been caught by the wave of devastation. They lay twisted and blackened, their flesh melted, their metal crushed. A few had survived, but they had been easy to despatch. In the belly of the Immolator, the canoness was offering her thanks for His protection. Surrounded by the tank’s metal walls, Caia sat by Sister Rhene, her helm off, and swallowing tears – though there was no shame in grief, now the battle was over. Rhene sat with her, the old Hospitaller’s voice gentle. She said, ‘Your Sisters died with honour, Caia de Musa. They stand before the Golden Throne, and they stand blessed. They have succeeded in their mission, and shown great courage.’ ‘I know,’ Caia nodded, though she could say no more. Rhene touched her knee, gentle, like an elderly aunt. ‘I have seen many things, Sister Caia – battles and horrors, the rot and disease of the deepest mines, creations of warp and Ruin. I understand that there are greater wounds than battle injuries – and I know He sees them also. You worship Him with warfare, but to me, He is a figure of great healing. His peace be upon you, and His light in your soul.’ ‘Sometimes,’ the canoness said softly, ‘it takes more courage to survive. Fear not, Sister Caia, He has a plan for you. And He knows where you will–’ ‘Please, milady!’ At the canoness’ words, Caia looked up, her grief suddenly congealing into a cold and absolute dread. She had known, all along, that this was coming, known that the canoness had another plan for her. She said, ‘Please don’t expel me from the Order!’ Ianthe blinked. She should discipline Caia significantly, but she seemed almost confused. ‘Expel you, Sister?’ ‘I’m a warrior, your eminence. Have I not proven–’ ‘And why would you be anything else?’ There was a distinct note of warning in Ianthe’s tone. Caught, Caia paused, looking from canoness to Hospitaller and back. She said, the words falling over themselves, ‘Please, milady, my bloodline is too faint. I’m a second cousin of a second cousin, a grand-niece of a grand-niece. I know nothing of Spire politics. I could never be–’ ‘You forget yourself, Sister.’ The snap was back in the canoness’ voice. ‘I comprehend your grief, and I share it – but you will control your outbursts.’ ‘Milady.’ Caia inhaled, steadying herself, then let out a slow breath. During the battle, Ianthe had lost her distant, austere manner, and had become a figure of great passion and strength. Now, she returned to her unquestioned cold authority, and Caia, slightly belatedly, remembered her place. She lowered her gaze, ‘Your eminence.’ Rhene cackled, and patted Caia’s knee again. ‘You’ve conjured this dread for yourself, Sister Caia,’ she said. ‘Fear not, I do not see you in a decorous robe. Look at the state of you – the Orders Famulous would never accept a Sister so downright grubby.’ She continued to cackle, and Caia, feeling immensely foolish, lowered her head in a prayer. Augusta’s squad was a mess. Guided by Sister Rhea’s experiences upon Mete, carrying their injured Sisters, they had taken shelter in the depths of the librarium, a place of vast and crumbling data-banks, of Vastum’s rotting knowledge and forgotten resources. As the countdown had measured their lives in remaining seconds, they’d almost fallen down the long stairway and then, with a desperate prayer, they’d thrown themselves on the floor. And He had heard them. Shielded by the ancient Mechanicus’ stone and wisdom, scattered with falling dust and debris, the squad had survived the blast. Battered, exhausted and filthy, Augusta had offered a hymn to His foresight and mercy, and a prayer of thanks for the miracle. It seemed He was not ready to call them to the Throne – not yet. They’d stumbled through half-collapsed corridors, through rubble and rock and dust; they’d almost crawled, half-blind, over the burned-black stone, and at last, they’d found the beach where the tanks stood waiting. The canoness, Sister Caia with her, had come to meet them. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Augusta.’ ‘Ave Imperator, your eminence.’ At the limits of her endurance, Augusta pulled herself to her full height and returned the salute. She had Akemi over her shoulder; Viola was semi-conscious and being half-carried, half-dragged by Alcina and Melia; Rhea had Viola’s weapon as well as her own. ‘Sister Rhene will see to your injured,’ Ianthe said, indicating the Immolator. ‘Report.’ Right there, on the desolate black beach, the smoking ruin of the citadel behind her, Augusta gave that report. Her words were clipped, efficient, but aching with weariness. But when she reached the final battle, and the presence of the heretek dominus, Sister Alcina stepped forwards to stop her. ‘Permission to speak, milady,’ she said. ‘Granted,’ Ianthe answered. ‘Your eminence,’ Alcina said. ‘My orders were to report on the performance of Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, and of her squad. To assess whether the witch Scafidis Zale had left any touch of Ruin upon them, and to analyse their operation in the field.’ Augusta said nothing; she had known this was coming. But the fact that Alcina had spoken it openly… The canoness, it seemed, had drawn the same conclusion. ‘I take it, Sister Alcina, that your report is positive?’ ‘It is positive,’ Alcina said. ‘There is no touch of Ruin upon these Sisters, and they have conducted this mission with great courage.’ ‘And what of the deserter? Mors?’ ‘Both soldiers,’ Alcina said, ‘gave their lives, with honour, in the service of the Emperor.’ She made no attempt to explain further. Ianthe nodded, her eyes still scanning Augusta. Augusta noticed that she, too, was filthy, her armour dented, her face and hair covered in smears and grit. Caia, likewise, her armour dirty and battered with impacts. ‘I am glad,’ Ianthe said, at last. ‘Glad that He has blessed you, Sister Superior. You are warriors born, all of you, and I am proud to call you my Sisters. He has blessed us all, this day – we have achieved our mission, slain both the tech-priest and her collaborator, and prevented their corrupted army from leaving this world.

      "content": "Grimdak liked stomping. It wasn’t that he was big, exactly; the boss was bigger. But Grimdak was smart. Grimdak knew all the best places, all the best scraps and corners and heaps of junk. An’ besides, the boss wasn’t out here, and right now, that made Grimdak the biggest ork there was. Da biggest ork on da walkway. That, and his deffgun was the bestest. Stamping down the rusting, rotting tunnels of the great hulk, his muscled shoulders catching on hanging cables and old supports, his red eyes looking for the shiny, Grimdak liked the weight it gave him. He’d made it himself, because of course he had, scavenging the ruin for some bits, trading what he found for others. Razgog’d even let him use the mekboy workshop, so long as he did some of the welding and cutting. And that meant his deffgun was ginormous. It made him heavier, stronger. And it made his stomping loud, his boots bashing good on the metal. He liked the echoes, the banging percussion that said: Da ork is comin’! Faded lumens flickered at the noise, showering sparks as he passed them; they made shadows jump along the walls, shapes like threats. As his own outline fell ahead of him, he let off a burst of rounds, just because he could. It boomed and roared and deafened him, but he liked it. He liked the spank of the ricochets, the big explosions that bellowed back from the far end of the tunnel. He liked the creaking and the smashing that came after. They told everything to get outta da bleedin’ way! Yaaah! His deffgun was good, turning anything to a greasy smear. Carrying it, Grimdak wasn’t scared of nothing. Not those big scuttlies – fast, but not fast enough. Not those poncy, prancy things with their stupid hair, or those ranks of boring robots. Grimdak’d even seen a Space Marine once, hiding his backside in all that snazzy armour. Hadn’t done him any good – the boss still wore his pauldrons. Remembering the battle, he snickered round his teeth. That’d been a big one, but Zoldag Legmangla, warboss, had claimed this hulk for the Deathskullz, and he wasn’t giving it up. The Space Marine’s skull, helmet and all, sat atop the warboss’ throne. And his boyz’d never had it so good. Two levels down and a big bag of loot later, Grimdak stopped by a ruined control panel. Its screen was shattered, half chewed off; its wires hung loose. They were red and gleaming, spilled like guts, and he knew that colour of metal. Razgog needed it, it was good stuff for fixing busted connections. Yanking the front fully off the thing, he poked it with a curious talon, waiting to see if it’d catapult him back down the walkway… Was slightly disappointed when nothing happened. In the stomp-free quiet, however, he heard a noise. A noise like boots. Big boots. Grimdak stopped. Legmangla’s Skullz owned the hulk, but them was boots, all right. Loud boots, metal boots. Boots that moved all tidy-like. Military boots. Not as big as the Space Marine, but big enough. They were still some distance away, somewhere down by the old genny-rators, he reckoned. But he was sure of one thing… Them boots weren’t orks. He frowned, scratching hard at one metal-pierced ear. Bits of snotling were still caught in it, but he wasn’t worried about that now. Fink, he told himself. The boss’ hulk was called Da Big Mouf and it was bleedin’ huge. It was more than one ship, all smushed together and stuck like that, roaring on though the void. It had lots of different ends and bits, sticking out all over the place, plus the central vortex that had given it its name – something to do with the tangled gravities of the individual ships. The boss’ throne was a way back, on the biggest command deck; the escape pods were used by the mekboyz; and old Skalagrog preached and sparked and ranted his way through the lower tunnels. Even the gunnery decks, used for sleeping and eating and fighting, were– Them boots were getting closer. He scratched his ear a bit harder, then inspected his claw and chewed the filth out of it. He was too big to sneak, and, anyhow, that wasn’t the way. He was an ork, the biggest baddest ork on the walkway. With the biggest, baddest deffgun. Yeah! Da loota wiv da shoota! Hoiking the thing a bit higher on his shoulder, he folded down the targeter and kicked in the scanners. I is da big ork! An’ I is gonna finds ya! The boots were a level below him, he reckoned, down in the old helot tunnels where some of the mangled servitors still roamed, every one of them mad as a bucket of snotlings. Sometimes, if he needed the really good swag, he went down there after them. The ladder was nearby, and though its rungs were busted, he’d be able to see straight down. Yeah, like shootin’ humies in a barrel! Grinning though his snaggled fangs, he stomped that way. And then, he heard something else. Arriving back at the warboss’ throne, Grimdak skidded to a stop in a state of almost-panic. ‘Boss!’ He was pointing frenziedly behind him, though the deffgun made it almost impossible for him to turn. ‘We gots trouble! I see’d ’em! Dey’s comin’, an’ dey got boltas, an’ shootas an’ ’eavy fings. An’ fings dat…’ Catching Legmangla’s lava-eyed glare, he shut his mouth. Backed up a prudent step. Framed by a wealth of trophies, the warboss unfolded to his feet. Zoldag was huge, his shoulders fully big enough to fill the yellow pauldrons, his ears heavy with scavenged metal. Parts of his armour were made from black chitin, and he bore a necklace of mismatched skulls. His filed teeth were tipped in sharpened steel and covered in shreds of Gork-alone-knew-what. And his left arm was fully augmetic, ending in a four-taloned claw bigger than Grimdak’s head. The claw had come from a Dreadnought. And Grimdak should know – he’d found the bleedin’ thing. At the warboss’ feet, a twitching gretchin stood ready to run his errands. ‘You wot?’ Legmangla rumbled, a bubbling snarl that started deep in his chest. It echoed round the throne room’s crumbling panels like a rolling boulder. Words tripping over themselves, Grimdak tried to explain. ‘Dey… dey’s humies, boss, an’ dey gots all the armour. Shiny. Yeah, good. But dey was singin’…’ He got no further. The warboss gave a rippling roar, the noise enough to make the gretchin cower and cover its ears. Grimdak gulped, but refused to let himself flinch. Good thing too, as the boss idly booted the smaller creature and sent it sailing into an upper support. It squeaked in protest, crunched with the impact and crashed to the floor. It didn’t move again. Stamping down three steps, Legmangla fixed Grimdak with a baleful, scarlet glower. ‘You runned away. You saw da humies, an’ you runned away.’ He bared his fangs, his breath reeking. ‘Is you an ork, or is you a stinkin’, snivellin’ grot?’ ‘I is an ork, boss.’ Grimdak backed up another step. ‘I… I jus’ came to tells ya! Bring ya da newz. An’ I gots…’ With his best ingratiating grin, he grabbed a fistful of his captured swag, and held it out. The boss paused, eyeing the copper wire. On the floor between them, at the foot of his seat, lay his huge pile of scavenged booty – more bits of Space Marine and Dreadnought, the claws of a genestealer, the plume from an aeldari helm. The Apothecary’s narthecium, his proudest possession. It glinted like an evil grin. Legmangla eyed the wires, then the pile, then rumbled again, apparently thinking. Then he bellowed, loud enough to rattle the ancient glass screens. ‘Baz!’ Grimdak backed up even further, smack into the ork behind him. He jumped, turned. And there was Bazruk da Stompa, ork nob, casually picking his fangs with a long and dirty spike. He leered down, grinning. ‘Awright, loota?’ His words were easy, dangerous. ‘Wot’s you done now?’ ‘Nuffink,’ Grimdak said quickly, scrambling out of the way. Bazruk’s grin grew. Behind him, more orks tumbled into the chamber, nobz and boyz, weapons in hands. A scatter of gretchin came with them, darting between their feet and trying not to get stomped on. Bazruk snarled at the massed pack, and it scuffled and shoved to quiet, waiting. Legmangla eyed his troops. ‘Awright,’ he said. ‘Grimdak’s gots us somethin’ speshal.’ He grinned, a mouthful of knives. ‘Dere’s humies in da tunnels, an’ dey gots da good loot. An’ by the teefs of Gork an’ Mork, we’s gonna finds ’em an’ we’s gonna stamp on their ’eads. We’s gonna breaks dem outta dere shells, and squish all dere pink insides.’ The grin grew. ‘An’ I’s gonna gets meself a bran’ new prize.’ He threw a thumb over his shoulder, at the helm that topped the throne. ‘A li’l one, ta go by da big one.’ Orks nudged each other, snickering. But Legmangla’s grin vanished. Fangs bared, his red gaze moved from ork to ork like a laser sight. It settled on Grimdak. ‘But,’ he said. ‘Before we gets stuck in, you tell me somethin’.’ Greenskins eyed each other, their boots. Not one of them met the warboss’ gaze. Still glaring at Grimdak, he said, ‘Oo founds da relic?’ Grimdak blinked. ‘Wot?’ ‘Relic?’ Mutters and shuffles; each ork glared at his nearest neighbours. ‘Wot relic?’ Leaning casually on the nearest upright, Bazruk continued to pick his teeth. Greatly daring, Grimdak answered, ‘We ain’t gots no relics, boss.’ He pointed at the throne, the pile. ‘All da good stuff’s dere. No relics!’ ‘Dem singin’ humies, dey always come afta da relics,’ Legmangla said, his tone spelling it out. He fixed Grimdak with a nasty stare, and Grimdak gulped. He had no idea if Legmangla could swallow the deffgun as well as the ork that carried it, and he didn’t want to find out. After all, look at what’d happened to ol’ Scarmush. Never mind that now. Bristling, Legmangla stomped down the last two steps. Still framed by the loot-encrusted throne-back, his pile of his swag at his boots, he made a swipe at where Grimdak was standing. The loota jumped out the way, but Legmangla’s grab had not been aimed at him. Bazruk cursed as the toothpick was snatched from his hand. ‘’Ere! Dat’s…!’ The boss growled him to silence, examined the spike, then shook it, right in Bazruk’s face. ‘Wot’s dis, den?’ he roared. ‘Da ’and of bleedin’ Mork?’ Faced by the boss, even Bazruk backed up. He looked around him for support, but every other ork in the room was studiously staring elsewhere. ‘I… Uh…’ The boss shook it again. ‘Where’d ya gets dis?’ ‘Dere was a coffin?’ Bazruk ventured. ‘Big stone fing? Out near da mouf–’ With a roar, Legmangla lunged. He drove the toothpick, sharp end first, straight through the hollow of Baz’s throat. Bazruk gawked, startled, then went over backwards with a crash. He gagged, choked, kicked, and was still. Gore seeped out across the slatted metal floor. Orks chuckled and snorted; a few kicked at the downed body, just for good measure. But Legmangla was not laughing. With a bellow, he brought the boyz to stillness. ‘When you gets da loot, you brings it ’ere!’ One massive boot kicked the glinting pile. ‘You gots that? You don’ts use it ta picks ya teef!’ Bazruk’s toothpick was now stuck straight up in the air like a monument, marking where the nob’s stupidity had ended. Its blunt end, Grimdak realised, was the familiar round hip joint of an ancient, humie thigh bone. And, while he couldn’t read them, the thing was engraved with words, all the way down. ‘Oops,’ he commented, when Legmangla couldn’t hear. ‘WAAAGH!’ Bellowing, bristling with weapons, the boyz surged out of the airlock door, running straight for the main companionway. Grimdak had tried to sidle from the boss’ line of sight, but Legmangla grabbed him by one ear, and dragged him right up the front. ‘You found ’em,’ he said. ‘You go finds ’em again.’ ‘Boss.’ In the deffgun, he had a motion detector, of sorts. It was a bit twitchy – picked up the bilge rats sometimes – but it was enough. With Legmangla pounding beside him, and a surge of gleeful greenskins behind, he ran. We gonna krush dem humies good an’ propa! At first, however, the hulk seemed empty. Covered in the orks’ garish graffiti, it clanged and bashed and echoed to the sounds of their charge, creaking and groaning. Squeaky things scattered from the orks’ boots; they stamped at them, laughing. Junctions and ladders were daubed with colours and pictures and warnings, with the skull symbols of their tribe and with caricatures of its various members. In other places, old Skalagrog had sent up warnings, standing totems of bones and captured booty. Marking the parts of Legmangla’s territory, they said: Don’t mess wiv da orks! Skalagrog himself had joined them, though the rest of the tribe were giving him a wide berth. More than one ork had met a sizzle-fried end when ol’ Skalagrog got carried away. They sang as they ran: ‘Mash ’em, bash ’em! Crunch ’em, munch ’em! We da boyz, an’ we lives ’ere! Fite ’em, smite ’em! Beats ’em, eats ’em! We da boyz, we gots no fear!’ As they chanted, they pushed and shoved, mocking and jostling. Bazruk’s demise had left a gap, and the biggest of the remaining orks were eager to fill it. At the back, a few voices started raggedly shouting, ‘’Ere we go, ’ere we go, ’ere we go!’ Grimdak, however, didn’t join the fun. His feet bashed to the main rhythm, but he was watching the motion detector in his flip-down eyepiece. Nuffink. Occasional, scuttling blips – more rats, and a distance away; there was nothing big enough, or well-ordered enough, to be the force he’d seen. And he could feel the close, watchful rumble of Legmangla’s authority. It said: Don’t get dis wrong, loota. The tribe continued to chant: ‘Thump ’em, whump ’em! Crash ’em, bash ’em! We da boyz, an’ we’s awright! Tromp ’em, stomp ’em! Smack ’em, whack ’em! We da boyz, an’ we can fight!’ Steadily, the companion-route led out into the main body of the hulk. The graffiti faded back to red and gnawing rust, and the lumens grew weaker, casting almost no light. Around them, the space soon opened out into a vast and looming darkness, and their boots rang hollow on the now suspended walkway. A cold and empty wind began to pluck at them, teasing. It stank of dead stuff. Here, Grimdak wanted to slow down. He was smart, right; he knew the hulk better than his mates, and he knew that they were heading for the central hub, for the point where the vast ships all collided. He’d seen it many times, all the tunnels that led up and out and away, and at impossibly bonkers angles that just hurt your brain… And out there, in the middle of it all, was the thing that Legmangla had called the ‘mouf’. It was ever-hungry, the place where everything twisted, round and round, pulling everything down into itself. Grimdak didn’t know where the stuff went, though Razgog had once tried to explain to him. He did know, though, that more than one ork had got too close, trying to prove how scared he wasn’t, and had gone bawling over the railings. It wasn’t long before they all felt the change, the charge, the sucking greed in the air. ‘Fink you’s big, wiv all dat noize? Gots news for youz, ’cause we’s DA BOYZ!’ The chant reached its end, bled out into the open darkness. The air was full of sounds: phantom yells, cries that they couldn’t quite hear, the creak and grind of unsettled metal. The orks turned grim, stamping fast and focused, their faces furrowed, fangs bared. Yeah, Grimdak thought, as they closed on the location of the vortex. Mouf or no mouf, dey wuz ready. The ambush hit them hard. Grimdak had not seen motion; there was only the sudden flare of muzzle flash, the boom of heavy weapons, the rip and roar of carbide fusion rounds, cutting through air and flesh and metal. And singing, the sort of powerful, humie tunes that could only mean one thing. The loota bellowed a warning, but the noise was lost in the racket. Cries, shrieks, shouts. Detonations, sudden splotches of exploding warmth. Flying flesh. Tumbling bodies. Orks cursing and colliding, the confused bang of their boots and the screeches of crushed gretchin. The whoosh of a handheld flamer. Burning boyz, stumbling into each other or from the walkway’s edge. Falling, flailing sideways as the vortex took them and gobbled them down. The spang of a snapped cable and the walkway lurching, knocking boyz from their feet… Grimdak stayed upright, his legs splayed apart, riding the slewing metal with knees like gimbals; his motion detector was blipping, movement ahead and behind. Two, four, six dots. Six? Dat was all? But the ambush had been well placed. Here, the bridge was curving through a right angle, avoiding the sick, dark whirl of the mouf, and the boyz were straggled out, all around the curve. Illuminated only by erratic flashes of gunfire, Grimdak could just make out the attackers, a distance back. Three at the front, their ceramite armour gleaming darkly scarlet, their cloaks in black and white, and flapping in the vortex’s wind. ‘WAAAGH!’ Legmangla bawled the command. Howling, the orks attacked. The bark and roar of weapons fire, the flash of axes in the half-light. Right at the front, Grimdak targeted the deffgun. The boss thundered past him, claw champing, his captured tech-priest choppa ready in his other hand. With a yell of his own, the loota opened fire. The weapon boomed, the noise incredible; it crashed back from the metalwork like some vast, steel drumbeat. The red-clad figure in front of him was smaller than the others; he could see the distinctive pattern of its helmet, its bolter held hard in both hands. His suppression went over the humie as it dropped neatly sideways, then rolled back up, still shooting. Behind it, explosions blossomed, the flames sucked away by the vortex’s pull. The walkway shivered, quaked again. The whirl sucked and crackled and spat. Eager. Starving. Grimdak roared, bared his teeth. ‘We iz da orks!’ In the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. There were bodies everywhere, orks shooting back, orks falling down. Bolter rounds struck the loota and spanged, repelled by the deffgun’s shoulder-mount. He juddered at the impacts, but he didn’t go over. Sparks burned his cheek. Shouts were rising now, boots crashing in an upsurge of defiance. ‘We owns da hulk!’ ‘We’s gonna krush!’ ‘Stompin’ an’ shootin’! Stompin’ an’ shootin’!’ Ahead of Grimdak, Legmangla hurled his full body weight at the central armoured figure, bigger than the other two. The figure let off a shot with the bolter, then stepped from the warboss’ path. With a tidy throw-and-catch, it reversed its grip on its weapon and slammed the butt sideways into the ork’s face. Snarling, Legmangla lashed out with the choppa, simultaneously slamming the claw into the figure’s chestplate, then opening it out to gouge a screaming hole in the metal. In the flashes, Grimdak could make out the third figure, a flamer in its gauntleted hands. The singing continued, like knives in Grimdak’s brain. ‘Down!’ he yelled, and the warboss ducked. The flamer’s gout missed him, and torched the two orks behind. A detonation of ammunition was sucked away by the mouf. But Grimdak only glanced; he didn’t have time to waste. He heard shouts, crashing, smashing, roaring, shooting, pandemonium. Another cable spanged, the walkway lurched again. He could hear Skalagrog chanting, feel the flicker and flash of his gathering power, fed by the other orks. Mork alone knew what good that would do… ‘Grim!’ The boss’ command was a bark. ‘Go gets da big shoota!’ ‘Boss!’ Understanding, Grimdak dropped back towards the corner. In front of him, Legmangla executed his signature move, stamping sideways on his enemy’s knee, and snapping it clean, armour and all. The figure went over, but still managed to reverse its grip, again, on the weapon and shoot upwards at the boss’ head. It missed. The flamer roared again, the wash of its heat enough to crisp the hairs in Grimdak’s nose. The flames, like everything else, were sucked sideways and away. Then a roaring gaggle of boyz broke past him, heading for the attackers, and he was abruptly caught in the centre of the mêlée. And Mork’s teef, it was a mess. There were orks everywhere, getting in his way, tripping him over as he tried to move. They were confused, some injured, some dying; the pull of the air was tugging them all towards the walkway’s now-dangling edge. In some places, they fought back, bawling defiance; in others they struggled with the fall, or with each other. Gretchin scampered here and there, some of them trying to fight, others chortling gleefully and looting their downed comrades. One squeaked protest as the hulk’s mouf took him; he was a thrashing silhouette, and then he was gone. Somewhere, Grimdak could hear the roar and whip-crack of their herder, demanding that they ‘Attack da humies!’ Somewhere else, there was still Skalagrog, crackling like a bared wire, now, and ready to throw his bright and unstable energy in all directions… But hey, it meant that Grimdak could see. Kicking at a grabbing green hand, he turned the corner fully. And found turmoil. Three more figures were standing at the back of the ambushed tribe, one with a running chainsword, another with a heavy bolter, aimed from the hip, and all covered in shiny symbols. One part of his brain jumped up and down at the find, desperately wanting to grab the things and get them back to the workshop – the stuffs that Razgog could make! – but the other part was smarter, and could see the devastation that the weapon had made. Even as he looked, there was a bellow, and four of the biggest nobz charged straight at the attackers. The one with the heavy weapon dropped back, still firing, then clunked to a halt. The figure swore. The first two orks were caught by the suppression; they shuddered at repeated impacts, skidding to the floor. Another went down to the third figure, a shot going clean through his forehead. Ragbad, unhurt, surged forwards. But the figure with the chainsword came to meet him, and Grimdak stopped. Though not as big as the one Legmangla had charged, it moved like pure, tight hostility, smooth and furious. Sneering, Ragbad raised his forearm to block, and the blade just carved straight through, shrieking briefly as it cut the bone. Rag screeched like failing steel, but kept going, trying to leap on the figure and bear it to the ground. ‘Yaaaa! I don’t needs me arm anyhowz!’ The figure stepped back, bringing the chainsword up, two-handed, and cutting him almost clear in half, armour and all. For a split second, Grimdak stopped, gawking. But Legmangla was still up, still bellowing ‘WAAAGH!’ Belatedly, the loota opened fire; hit all three figures with a full suppression. The heavy weapon was down, changing magazine; he saw his own rounds spark from the thing, flashes of violent orange. They chewed a line across the user’s armour, throwing it backwards. It screamed at him, savage, rolling back to its feet. ‘Domine! Libra Nos!’ He bellowed back, ‘I iz da bestest ork! Da loota wiv da shoota!’ With a cry like pure rage, the figure with the chainsword came forwards, the weapon still running, sending flicks of Rag’s gore to spatter against the metalwork. Grimdak lowered the muzzle of the deffgun and hit it with a full, directed burst– The deffgun jammed. ‘Mork’s teef!’ he cursed, backing up fast. More of the tribe surged past him, Skalagrog included. The enemy bolter took out one target, two, then was buried by a pile of green. But Grimdak wasn’t looking, he was trying to unjam the– Skalagrog struck. A blaze of static energy exploded on the walkway, its lightning slanting towards the vortex. In response, the deffgun crackled and sparked, and the motion detector in his eyepiece went dead. ‘Wot’s you doin’, you–’ The full blaze of Skalagrog’s fury hit the chainsword figure in the chest. The figure stood stock-still for moment, its armour sputtering, smoking at the shoulders and ablaze with every colour Grimdak could name… ‘Yaaaa!’ Somewhere, Legmangla was still shouting; Grimdak couldn’t turn but he figured the boss was ripping his way through the enemy, breaking legs and heads. The flamethrower coughed again, a wide arc of fire. Gretchin screamed, fell. Their flesh aflame, they were everywhere and underfoot. More of them were tumbling from the walkway now, being sucked sideways into the vortex. And the vortex… The mouf was growing. Grimdak didn’t understand it, and Razgog wasn’t there to ask, but the lightning flashes of old Skalagrog’s energies were being sucked sideways, just like the fallen orks. And the mouf was getting bigger, tugging at hair and pulling flame and smoke and flesh down into its ever-churning belly. And then, the unthinkable happened. Grimdak didn’t see it, but he heard the noise. A third spang as another cable snapped, and the walkway lurched again, now swinging dangerously in the vortex’s winds. Impossible corridor angles led away in all directions; they messed with his head, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was the roar of rage as Legmangla lost his footing. The walkway itself was twisting, now, screeching in protest; it hurt Grimdak’s eyes to look at it. Then something massive skidded past him, grappling for hold, and went straight off the walkway’s edge. With a gawp of disbelief, Grimdak saw Legmangla shoot past him, swearing. But the boss didn’t fall. The Dreadnought claw lashed out, grabbed the railing, and hung on. He swung there, over the drop. The walkway creaked and groaned at the boss’ massive weight, twisting even further. More and more orks were losing their footing now, shrieking obscenities. Skalagrog was sliding. Grimdak, too. Legmangla hung over the drop, kicking his boots, snarling in outrage. From the armoured enemy, a barked command. Responding instantly, the heavy weapon opened fire – straight down. For an instant, Grimdak didn’t realise what they were doing, but he caught himself up as the rounds chewed holes in the metal, and the part the orks were standing on started to come away. The walkway screamed as it tore, the noise cutting at his ears. His deffgun was too heavy. Any bleedin’ minute…! Grimdak had a split second to make a decision. In front of him, the three attackers were now standing on a stable steel platform, its edge cut free. The vortex was growing, reaching out hungrily as more orks slipped towards it. Skalagrog’s lightnings seemed to be feeding it, somehow, making it– No time, Grimdak told himself. You’s da smart ork. Fink! To the front, one of the figures was tending to their downed mate; the other one, the small one, was covering, bolter ready. As he glanced, he saw the bolter was aimed at the still-dangling warboss, his claw slammed closed on the creaking railing. And Legmangla’s huge weight was pulling the whole walkway down. Cut free at its other end, it was starting to hinge like a door… Grimdak couldn’t back up – the walkway was broken and the heavy weapon would cut him to pieces. He had to go forwards… Jump! Legmangla caught his gaze and said something, the words torn away by the vortex. But Grimdak was past caring. There was an old ork saying, he remembered, one that Razgog lived by. Not the biggest ork in the tribe, the mekboy was definitely the smartest – he wasn’t out here, for a start. ‘Bestest way to win when dere’s too many?’ Raz had once said. ‘S’called da Air Gap Teknik.’ ‘Wot?’ Grimdak had asked him. ‘Air gap, clunk-brain. Da bigger da betta.’ Fink, Grimdak told himself, again. Razgog had been right – he knew what to do. And besides, the mekboy was still in the workshop, and Grim knew the hulk – he could circle back around the mouf, back to the warboss’ chambers… Pick up the relic. The good loot. Warbosses came and went, but Grim… yeah, he always survived. I iz da smart ork. Letting off a single, suppressive volley at the three figures, he made them keep their heads down. Then he jumped, right for their position. They swore, swinging weapons to cover him, but he was fast, deffgun or not. He broke past the bolter-figure and the crouched one with the flamer, and he just ran for it. As he did so, he heard the massive screeching creak as the railing finally gave way and Legmangla tumbled, howling, towards the vortex. He didn’t know what had happened to Skalagrog and he didn’t pause to worry. He put his head down, and he ran. Behind him, the figures were moving. A bolter round whisked past his ear; he heard the cough of the flamer, felt it singe his skin. Flames chasing him down the tunnel, Grimdak made his escape. ‘Well, Sisters?’ Her armour still crackling, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus switched off the chainsword’s mechanism. Viola, despite the line of dents in her chestplate, was covering the still-whirling vortex; Caia was checking the auspex for anything else incoming. On the far side of the now-fallen walkway, Sister Alcina was down. Melia was on one knee beside her, sanguinator in hand. Akemi covered them both, but her attention was on the fleeing ork with the shoulder-mounted weapon. ‘Permission to go after the greenskin?’ she said. ‘Denied,’ Augusta said. ‘Our priority is the mission. We have one Sister badly injured, and we’re running out of time. We must locate our target. Melia, did you catch it as it fled?’ ‘I believe so,’ Melia answered. ‘It wasn’t quite fast enough.’ ‘Enough that we’ll know it if we see it again,’ Akemi commented. ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘I hate to leave a loose ork roaming, and we should move location before it comes back with reinforcements. Caia, do you have a lead on the relic?’ ‘Report said it was in the casket on the nose of the Might in Vengeance,’ Caia said. ‘But we know the casket’s empty. I suggest we find the warboss’ hoard. If it’s anywhere…’ ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘Melia, can Alcina be moved?’ ‘I can move, Sister.’ Alcina’s voice was hoarse, but determined. ‘But I fear I will not be swift.’ ‘Truly, the Emperor is with you, Sister Alcina,’ Augusta commented, a smile in her tone. ‘You are made of His mettle.’ With a groan, the squad’s second came to her feet, staggered, righted herself. The hole in her armour was impressive, but beneath it, Melia’s skills had stopped her bleeding. ‘He is with all of us,’ Alcina answered. ‘Now, if the holy thigh bone of Saint Finiang is here, then we had better regroup, and seek it swiftly.’",

      "content": "Grimdak liked stomping. It wasn’t that he was big, exactly; the boss was bigger. But Grimdak was smart. Grimdak knew all the best places, all the best scraps and corners and heaps of junk. An’ besides, the boss wasn’t out here, and right now, that made Grimdak the biggest ork there was. Da biggest ork on da walkway. That, and his deffgun was the bestest. Stamping down the rusting, rotting tunnels of the great hulk, his muscled shoulders catching on hanging cables and old supports, his red eyes looking for the shiny, Grimdak liked the weight it gave him. He’d made it himself, because of course he had, scavenging the ruin for some bits, trading what he found for others. Razgog’d even let him use the mekboy workshop, so long as he did some of the welding and cutting. And that meant his deffgun was ginormous. It made him heavier, stronger. And it made his stomping loud, his boots bashing good on the metal. He liked the echoes, the banging percussion that said: Da ork is comin’! Faded lumens flickered at the noise, showering sparks as he passed them; they made shadows jump along the walls, shapes like threats. As his own outline fell ahead of him, he let off a burst of rounds, just because he could. It boomed and roared and deafened him, but he liked it. He liked the spank of the ricochets, the big explosions that bellowed back from the far end of the tunnel. He liked the creaking and the smashing that came after. They told everything to get outta da bleedin’ way! Yaaah! His deffgun was good, turning anything to a greasy smear. Carrying it, Grimdak wasn’t scared of nothing. Not those big scuttlies – fast, but not fast enough. Not those poncy, prancy things with their stupid hair, or those ranks of boring robots. Grimdak’d even seen a Space Marine once, hiding his backside in all that snazzy armour. Hadn’t done him any good – the boss still wore his pauldrons. Remembering the battle, he snickered round his teeth. That’d been a big one, but Zoldag Legmangla, warboss, had claimed this hulk for the Deathskullz, and he wasn’t giving it up. The Space Marine’s skull, helmet and all, sat atop the warboss’ throne. And his boyz’d never had it so good. Two levels down and a big bag of loot later, Grimdak stopped by a ruined control panel. Its screen was shattered, half chewed off; its wires hung loose. They were red and gleaming, spilled like guts, and he knew that colour of metal. Razgog needed it, it was good stuff for fixing busted connections. Yanking the front fully off the thing, he poked it with a curious talon, waiting to see if it’d catapult him back down the walkway… Was slightly disappointed when nothing happened. In the stomp-free quiet, however, he heard a noise. A noise like boots. Big boots. Grimdak stopped. Legmangla’s Skullz owned the hulk, but them was boots, all right. Loud boots, metal boots. Boots that moved all tidy-like. Military boots. Not as big as the Space Marine, but big enough. They were still some distance away, somewhere down by the old genny-rators, he reckoned. But he was sure of one thing… Them boots weren’t orks. He frowned, scratching hard at one metal-pierced ear. Bits of snotling were still caught in it, but he wasn’t worried about that now. Fink, he told himself. The boss’ hulk was called Da Big Mouf and it was bleedin’ huge. It was more than one ship, all smushed together and stuck like that, roaring on though the void. It had lots of different ends and bits, sticking out all over the place, plus the central vortex that had given it its name – something to do with the tangled gravities of the individual ships. The boss’ throne was a way back, on the biggest command deck; the escape pods were used by the mekboyz; and old Skalagrog preached and sparked and ranted his way through the lower tunnels. Even the gunnery decks, used for sleeping and eating and fighting, were– Them boots were getting closer. He scratched his ear a bit harder, then inspected his claw and chewed the filth out of it. He was too big to sneak, and, anyhow, that wasn’t the way. He was an ork, the biggest baddest ork on the walkway. With the biggest, baddest deffgun. Yeah! Da loota wiv da shoota! Hoiking the thing a bit higher on his shoulder, he folded down the targeter and kicked in the scanners. I is da big ork! An’ I is gonna finds ya! The boots were a level below him, he reckoned, down in the old helot tunnels where some of the mangled servitors still roamed, every one of them mad as a bucket of snotlings. Sometimes, if he needed the really good swag, he went down there after them. The ladder was nearby, and though its rungs were busted, he’d be able to see straight down. Yeah, like shootin’ humies in a barrel! Grinning though his snaggled fangs, he stomped that way. And then, he heard something else. Arriving back at the warboss’ throne, Grimdak skidded to a stop in a state of almost-panic. ‘Boss!’ He was pointing frenziedly behind him, though the deffgun made it almost impossible for him to turn. ‘We gots trouble! I see’d ’em! Dey’s comin’, an’ dey got boltas, an’ shootas an’ ’eavy fings. An’ fings dat…’ Catching Legmangla’s lava-eyed glare, he shut his mouth. Backed up a prudent step. Framed by a wealth of trophies, the warboss unfolded to his feet. Zoldag was huge, his shoulders fully big enough to fill the yellow pauldrons, his ears heavy with scavenged metal. Parts of his armour were made from black chitin, and he bore a necklace of mismatched skulls. His filed teeth were tipped in sharpened steel and covered in shreds of Gork-alone-knew-what. And his left arm was fully augmetic, ending in a four-taloned claw bigger than Grimdak’s head. The claw had come from a Dreadnought. And Grimdak should know – he’d found the bleedin’ thing. At the warboss’ feet, a twitching gretchin stood ready to run his errands. ‘You wot?’ Legmangla rumbled, a bubbling snarl that started deep in his chest. It echoed round the throne room’s crumbling panels like a rolling boulder. Words tripping over themselves, Grimdak tried to explain. ‘Dey… dey’s humies, boss, an’ dey gots all the armour. Shiny. Yeah, good. But dey was singin’…’ He got no further. The warboss gave a rippling roar, the noise enough to make the gretchin cower and cover its ears. Grimdak gulped, but refused to let himself flinch. Good thing too, as the boss idly booted the smaller creature and sent it sailing into an upper support. It squeaked in protest, crunched with the impact and crashed to the floor. It didn’t move again. Stamping down three steps, Legmangla fixed Grimdak with a baleful, scarlet glower. ‘You runned away. You saw da humies, an’ you runned away.’ He bared his fangs, his breath reeking. ‘Is you an ork, or is you a stinkin’, snivellin’ grot?’ ‘I is an ork, boss.’ Grimdak backed up another step. ‘I… I jus’ came to tells ya! Bring ya da newz. An’ I gots…’ With his best ingratiating grin, he grabbed a fistful of his captured swag, and held it out. The boss paused, eyeing the copper wire. On the floor between them, at the foot of his seat, lay his huge pile of scavenged booty – more bits of Space Marine and Dreadnought, the claws of a genestealer, the plume from an aeldari helm. The Apothecary’s narthecium, his proudest possession. It glinted like an evil grin. Legmangla eyed the wires, then the pile, then rumbled again, apparently thinking. Then he bellowed, loud enough to rattle the ancient glass screens. ‘Baz!’ Grimdak backed up even further, smack into the ork behind him. He jumped, turned. And there was Bazruk da Stompa, ork nob, casually picking his fangs with a long and dirty spike. He leered down, grinning. ‘Awright, loota?’ His words were easy, dangerous. ‘Wot’s you done now?’ ‘Nuffink,’ Grimdak said quickly, scrambling out of the way. Bazruk’s grin grew. Behind him, more orks tumbled into the chamber, nobz and boyz, weapons in hands. A scatter of gretchin came with them, darting between their feet and trying not to get stomped on. Bazruk snarled at the massed pack, and it scuffled and shoved to quiet, waiting. Legmangla eyed his troops. ‘Awright,’ he said. ‘Grimdak’s gots us somethin’ speshal.’ He grinned, a mouthful of knives. ‘Dere’s humies in da tunnels, an’ dey gots da good loot. An’ by the teefs of Gork an’ Mork, we’s gonna finds ’em an’ we’s gonna stamp on their ’eads. We’s gonna breaks dem outta dere shells, and squish all dere pink insides.’ The grin grew. ‘An’ I’s gonna gets meself a bran’ new prize.’ He threw a thumb over his shoulder, at the helm that topped the throne. ‘A li’l one, ta go by da big one.’ Orks nudged each other, snickering. But Legmangla’s grin vanished. Fangs bared, his red gaze moved from ork to ork like a laser sight. It settled on Grimdak. ‘But,’ he said. ‘Before we gets stuck in, you tell me somethin’.’ Greenskins eyed each other, their boots. Not one of them met the warboss’ gaze. Still glaring at Grimdak, he said, ‘Oo founds da relic?’ Grimdak blinked. ‘Wot?’ ‘Relic?’ Mutters and shuffles; each ork glared at his nearest neighbours. ‘Wot relic?’ Leaning casually on the nearest upright, Bazruk continued to pick his teeth. Greatly daring, Grimdak answered, ‘We ain’t gots no relics, boss.’ He pointed at the throne, the pile. ‘All da good stuff’s dere. No relics!’ ‘Dem singin’ humies, dey always come afta da relics,’ Legmangla said, his tone spelling it out. He fixed Grimdak with a nasty stare, and Grimdak gulped. He had no idea if Legmangla could swallow the deffgun as well as the ork that carried it, and he didn’t want to find out. After all, look at what’d happened to ol’ Scarmush. Never mind that now. Bristling, Legmangla stomped down the last two steps. Still framed by the loot-encrusted throne-back, his pile of his swag at his boots, he made a swipe at where Grimdak was standing. The loota jumped out the way, but Legmangla’s grab had not been aimed at him. Bazruk cursed as the toothpick was snatched from his hand. ‘’Ere! Dat’s…!’ The boss growled him to silence, examined the spike, then shook it, right in Bazruk’s face. ‘Wot’s dis, den?’ he roared. ‘Da ’and of bleedin’ Mork?’ Faced by the boss, even Bazruk backed up. He looked around him for support, but every other ork in the room was studiously staring elsewhere. ‘I… Uh…’ The boss shook it again. ‘Where’d ya gets dis?’ ‘Dere was a coffin?’ Bazruk ventured. ‘Big stone fing? Out near da mouf–’ With a roar, Legmangla lunged. He drove the toothpick, sharp end first, straight through the hollow of Baz’s throat. Bazruk gawked, startled, then went over backwards with a crash. He gagged, choked, kicked, and was still. Gore seeped out across the slatted metal floor. Orks chuckled and snorted; a few kicked at the downed body, just for good measure. But Legmangla was not laughing. With a bellow, he brought the boyz to stillness. ‘When you gets da loot, you brings it ’ere!’ One massive boot kicked the glinting pile. ‘You gots that? You don’ts use it ta picks ya teef!’ Bazruk’s toothpick was now stuck straight up in the air like a monument, marking where the nob’s stupidity had ended. Its blunt end, Grimdak realised, was the familiar round hip joint of an ancient, humie thigh bone. And, while he couldn’t read them, the thing was engraved with words, all the way down. ‘Oops,’ he commented, when Legmangla couldn’t hear. ‘WAAAGH!’ Bellowing, bristling with weapons, the boyz surged out of the airlock door, running straight for the main companionway. Grimdak had tried to sidle from the boss’ line of sight, but Legmangla grabbed him by one ear, and dragged him right up the front. ‘You found ’em,’ he said. ‘You go finds ’em again.’ ‘Boss.’ In the deffgun, he had a motion detector, of sorts. It was a bit twitchy – picked up the bilge rats sometimes – but it was enough. With Legmangla pounding beside him, and a surge of gleeful greenskins behind, he ran. We gonna krush dem humies good an’ propa! At first, however, the hulk seemed empty. Covered in the orks’ garish graffiti, it clanged and bashed and echoed to the sounds of their charge, creaking and groaning. Squeaky things scattered from the orks’ boots; they stamped at them, laughing. Junctions and ladders were daubed with colours and pictures and warnings, with the skull symbols of their tribe and with caricatures of its various members. In other places, old Skalagrog had sent up warnings, standing totems of bones and captured booty. Marking the parts of Legmangla’s territory, they said: Don’t mess wiv da orks! Skalagrog himself had joined them, though the rest of the tribe were giving him a wide berth. More than one ork had met a sizzle-fried end when ol’ Skalagrog got carried away. They sang as they ran: ‘Mash ’em, bash ’em! Crunch ’em, munch ’em! We da boyz, an’ we lives ’ere! Fite ’em, smite ’em! Beats ’em, eats ’em! We da boyz, we gots no fear!’ As they chanted, they pushed and shoved, mocking and jostling. Bazruk’s demise had left a gap, and the biggest of the remaining orks were eager to fill it. At the back, a few voices started raggedly shouting, ‘’Ere we go, ’ere we go, ’ere we go!’ Grimdak, however, didn’t join the fun. His feet bashed to the main rhythm, but he was watching the motion detector in his flip-down eyepiece. Nuffink. Occasional, scuttling blips – more rats, and a distance away; there was nothing big enough, or well-ordered enough, to be the force he’d seen. And he could feel the close, watchful rumble of Legmangla’s authority. It said: Don’t get dis wrong, loota. The tribe continued to chant: ‘Thump ’em, whump ’em! Crash ’em, bash ’em! We da boyz, an’ we’s awright! Tromp ’em, stomp ’em! Smack ’em, whack ’em! We da boyz, an’ we can fight!’ Steadily, the companion-route led out into the main body of the hulk. The graffiti faded back to red and gnawing rust, and the lumens grew weaker, casting almost no light. Around them, the space soon opened out into a vast and looming darkness, and their boots rang hollow on the now suspended walkway. A cold and empty wind began to pluck at them, teasing. It stank of dead stuff. Here, Grimdak wanted to slow down. He was smart, right; he knew the hulk better than his mates, and he knew that they were heading for the central hub, for the point where the vast ships all collided. He’d seen it many times, all the tunnels that led up and out and away, and at impossibly bonkers angles that just hurt your brain… And out there, in the middle of it all, was the thing that Legmangla had called the ‘mouf’. It was ever-hungry, the place where everything twisted, round and round, pulling everything down into itself. Grimdak didn’t know where the stuff went, though Razgog had once tried to explain to him. He did know, though, that more than one ork had got too close, trying to prove how scared he wasn’t, and had gone bawling over the railings. It wasn’t long before they all felt the change, the charge, the sucking greed in the air. ‘Fink you’s big, wiv all dat noize? Gots news for youz, ’cause we’s DA BOYZ!’ The chant reached its end, bled out into the open darkness. The air was full of sounds: phantom yells, cries that they couldn’t quite hear, the creak and grind of unsettled metal. The orks turned grim, stamping fast and focused, their faces furrowed, fangs bared. Yeah, Grimdak thought, as they closed on the location of the vortex. Mouf or no mouf, dey wuz ready. The ambush hit them hard. Grimdak had not seen motion; there was only the sudden flare of muzzle flash, the boom of heavy weapons, the rip and roar of carbide fusion rounds, cutting through air and flesh and metal. And singing, the sort of powerful, humie tunes that could only mean one thing. The loota bellowed a warning, but the noise was lost in the racket. Cries, shrieks, shouts. Detonations, sudden splotches of exploding warmth. Flying flesh. Tumbling bodies. Orks cursing and colliding, the confused bang of their boots and the screeches of crushed gretchin. The whoosh of a handheld flamer. Burning boyz, stumbling into each other or from the walkway’s edge. Falling, flailing sideways as the vortex took them and gobbled them down. The spang of a snapped cable and the walkway lurching, knocking boyz from their feet… Grimdak stayed upright, his legs splayed apart, riding the slewing metal with knees like gimbals; his motion detector was blipping, movement ahead and behind. Two, four, six dots. Six? Dat was all? But the ambush had been well placed. Here, the bridge was curving through a right angle, avoiding the sick, dark whirl of the mouf, and the boyz were straggled out, all around the curve. Illuminated only by erratic flashes of gunfire, Grimdak could just make out the attackers, a distance back. Three at the front, their ceramite armour gleaming darkly scarlet, their cloaks in black and white, and flapping in the vortex’s wind. ‘WAAAGH!’ Legmangla bawled the command. Howling, the orks attacked. The bark and roar of weapons fire, the flash of axes in the half-light. Right at the front, Grimdak targeted the deffgun. The boss thundered past him, claw champing, his captured tech-priest choppa ready in his other hand. With a yell of his own, the loota opened fire. The weapon boomed, the noise incredible; it crashed back from the metalwork like some vast, steel drumbeat. The red-clad figure in front of him was smaller than the others; he could see the distinctive pattern of its helmet, its bolter held hard in both hands. His suppression went over the humie as it dropped neatly sideways, then rolled back up, still shooting. Behind it, explosions blossomed, the flames sucked away by the vortex’s pull. The walkway shivered, quaked again. The whirl sucked and crackled and spat. Eager. Starving. Grimdak roared, bared his teeth. ‘We iz da orks!’ In the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. There were bodies everywhere, orks shooting back, orks falling down. Bolter rounds struck the loota and spanged, repelled by the deffgun’s shoulder-mount. He juddered at the impacts, but he didn’t go over. Sparks burned his cheek. Shouts were rising now, boots crashing in an upsurge of defiance. ‘We owns da hulk!’ ‘We’s gonna krush!’ ‘Stompin’ an’ shootin’! Stompin’ an’ shootin’!’ Ahead of Grimdak, Legmangla hurled his full body weight at the central armoured figure, bigger than the other two. The figure let off a shot with the bolter, then stepped from the warboss’ path. With a tidy throw-and-catch, it reversed its grip on its weapon and slammed the butt sideways into the ork’s face. Snarling, Legmangla lashed out with the choppa, simultaneously slamming the claw into the figure’s chestplate, then opening it out to gouge a screaming hole in the metal. In the flashes, Grimdak could make out the third figure, a flamer in its gauntleted hands. The singing continued, like knives in Grimdak’s brain. ‘Down!’ he yelled, and the warboss ducked. The flamer’s gout missed him, and torched the two orks behind. A detonation of ammunition was sucked away by the mouf. But Grimdak only glanced; he didn’t have time to waste. He heard shouts, crashing, smashing, roaring, shooting, pandemonium. Another cable spanged, the walkway lurched again. He could hear Skalagrog chanting, feel the flicker and flash of his gathering power, fed by the other orks. Mork alone knew what good that would do… ‘Grim!’ The boss’ command was a bark. ‘Go gets da big shoota!’ ‘Boss!’ Understanding, Grimdak dropped back towards the corner. In front of him, Legmangla executed his signature move, stamping sideways on his enemy’s knee, and snapping it clean, armour and all. The figure went over, but still managed to reverse its grip, again, on the weapon and shoot upwards at the boss’ head. It missed. The flamer roared again, the wash of its heat enough to crisp the hairs in Grimdak’s nose. The flames, like everything else, were sucked sideways and away. Then a roaring gaggle of boyz broke past him, heading for the attackers, and he was abruptly caught in the centre of the mêlée. And Mork’s teef, it was a mess. There were orks everywhere, getting in his way, tripping him over as he tried to move. They were confused, some injured, some dying; the pull of the air was tugging them all towards the walkway’s now-dangling edge. In some places, they fought back, bawling defiance; in others they struggled with the fall, or with each other. Gretchin scampered here and there, some of them trying to fight, others chortling gleefully and looting their downed comrades. One squeaked protest as the hulk’s mouf took him; he was a thrashing silhouette, and then he was gone. Somewhere, Grimdak could hear the roar and whip-crack of their herder, demanding that they ‘Attack da humies!’ Somewhere else, there was still Skalagrog, crackling like a bared wire, now, and ready to throw his bright and unstable energy in all directions… But hey, it meant that Grimdak could see. Kicking at a grabbing green hand, he turned the corner fully. And found turmoil. Three more figures were standing at the back of the ambushed tribe, one with a running chainsword, another with a heavy bolter, aimed from the hip, and all covered in shiny symbols. One part of his brain jumped up and down at the find, desperately wanting to grab the things and get them back to the workshop – the stuffs that Razgog could make! – but the other part was smarter, and could see the devastation that the weapon had made. Even as he looked, there was a bellow, and four of the biggest nobz charged straight at the attackers. The one with the heavy weapon dropped back, still firing, then clunked to a halt. The figure swore. The first two orks were caught by the suppression; they shuddered at repeated impacts, skidding to the floor. Another went down to the third figure, a shot going clean through his forehead. Ragbad, unhurt, surged forwards. But the figure with the chainsword came to meet him, and Grimdak stopped. Though not as big as the one Legmangla had charged, it moved like pure, tight hostility, smooth and furious. Sneering, Ragbad raised his forearm to block, and the blade just carved straight through, shrieking briefly as it cut the bone. Rag screeched like failing steel, but kept going, trying to leap on the figure and bear it to the ground. ‘Yaaaa! I don’t needs me arm anyhowz!’ The figure stepped back, bringing the chainsword up, two-handed, and cutting him almost clear in half, armour and all. For a split second, Grimdak stopped, gawking. But Legmangla was still up, still bellowing ‘WAAAGH!’ Belatedly, the loota opened fire; hit all three figures with a full suppression. The heavy weapon was down, changing magazine; he saw his own rounds spark from the thing, flashes of violent orange. They chewed a line across the user’s armour, throwing it backwards. It screamed at him, savage, rolling back to its feet. ‘Domine! Libra Nos!’ He bellowed back, ‘I iz da bestest ork! Da loota wiv da shoota!’ With a cry like pure rage, the figure with the chainsword came forwards, the weapon still running, sending flicks of Rag’s gore to spatter against the metalwork. Grimdak lowered the muzzle of the deffgun and hit it with a full, directed burst– The deffgun jammed. ‘Mork’s teef!’ he cursed, backing up fast. More of the tribe surged past him, Skalagrog included. The enemy bolter took out one target, two, then was buried by a pile of green. But Grimdak wasn’t looking, he was trying to unjam the– Skalagrog struck. A blaze of static energy exploded on the walkway, its lightning slanting towards the vortex. In response, the deffgun crackled and sparked, and the motion detector in his eyepiece went dead. ‘Wot’s you doin’, you–’ The full blaze of Skalagrog’s fury hit the chainsword figure in the chest. The figure stood stock-still for moment, its armour sputtering, smoking at the shoulders and ablaze with every colour Grimdak could name… ‘Yaaaa!’ Somewhere, Legmangla was still shouting; Grimdak couldn’t turn but he figured the boss was ripping his way through the enemy, breaking legs and heads. The flamethrower coughed again, a wide arc of fire. Gretchin screamed, fell. Their flesh aflame, they were everywhere and underfoot. More of them were tumbling from the walkway now, being sucked sideways into the vortex. And the vortex… The mouf was growing. Grimdak didn’t understand it, and Razgog wasn’t there to ask, but the lightning flashes of old Skalagrog’s energies were being sucked sideways, just like the fallen orks. And the mouf was getting bigger, tugging at hair and pulling flame and smoke and flesh down into its ever-churning belly. And then, the unthinkable happened. Grimdak didn’t see it, but he heard the noise. A third spang as another cable snapped, and the walkway lurched again, now swinging dangerously in the vortex’s winds. Impossible corridor angles led away in all directions; they messed with his head, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was the roar of rage as Legmangla lost his footing. The walkway itself was twisting, now, screeching in protest; it hurt Grimdak’s eyes to look at it. Then something massive skidded past him, grappling for hold, and went straight off the walkway’s edge. With a gawp of disbelief, Grimdak saw Legmangla shoot past him, swearing. But the boss didn’t fall. The Dreadnought claw lashed out, grabbed the railing, and hung on. He swung there, over the drop. The walkway creaked and groaned at the boss’ massive weight, twisting even further. More and more orks were losing their footing now, shrieking obscenities. Skalagrog was sliding. Grimdak, too. Legmangla hung over the drop, kicking his boots, snarling in outrage. From the armoured enemy, a barked command. Responding instantly, the heavy weapon opened fire – straight down. For an instant, Grimdak didn’t realise what they were doing, but he caught himself up as the rounds chewed holes in the metal, and the part the orks were standing on started to come away. The walkway screamed as it tore, the noise cutting at his ears. His deffgun was too heavy. Any bleedin’ minute…! Grimdak had a split second to make a decision. In front of him, the three attackers were now standing on a stable steel platform, its edge cut free. The vortex was growing, reaching out hungrily as more orks slipped towards it. Skalagrog’s lightnings seemed to be feeding it, somehow, making it– No time, Grimdak told himself. You’s da smart ork. Fink! To the front, one of the figures was tending to their downed mate; the other one, the small one, was covering, bolter ready. As he glanced, he saw the bolter was aimed at the still-dangling warboss, his claw slammed closed on the creaking railing. And Legmangla’s huge weight was pulling the whole walkway down. Cut free at its other end, it was starting to hinge like a door… Grimdak couldn’t back up – the walkway was broken and the heavy weapon would cut him to pieces. He had to go forwards… Jump! Legmangla caught his gaze and said something, the words torn away by the vortex. But Grimdak was past caring. There was an old ork saying, he remembered, one that Razgog lived by. Not the biggest ork in the tribe, the mekboy was definitely the smartest – he wasn’t out here, for a start. ‘Bestest way to win when dere’s too many?’ Raz had once said. ‘S’called da Air Gap Teknik.’ ‘Wot?’ Grimdak had asked him. ‘Air gap, clunk-brain. Da bigger da betta.’ Fink, Grimdak told himself, again. Razgog had been right – he knew what to do. And besides, the mekboy was still in the workshop, and Grim knew the hulk – he could circle back around the mouf, back to the warboss’ chambers… Pick up the relic. The good loot. Warbosses came and went, but Grim… yeah, he always survived. I iz da smart ork. Letting off a single, suppressive volley at the three figures, he made them keep their heads down. Then he jumped, right for their position. They swore, swinging weapons to cover him, but he was fast, deffgun or not. He broke past the bolter-figure and the crouched one with the flamer, and he just ran for it. As he did so, he heard the massive screeching creak as the railing finally gave way and Legmangla tumbled, howling, towards the vortex. He didn’t know what had happened to Skalagrog and he didn’t pause to worry. He put his head down, and he ran. Behind him, the figures were moving. A bolter round whisked past his ear; he heard the cough of the flamer, felt it singe his skin. Flames chasing him down the tunnel, Grimdak made his escape. ‘Well, Sisters?’ Her armour still crackling, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus switched off the chainsword’s mechanism. Viola, despite the line of dents in her chestplate, was covering the still-whirling vortex; Caia was checking the auspex for anything else incoming. On the far side of the now-fallen walkway, Sister Alcina was down. Melia was on one knee beside her, sanguinator in hand. Akemi covered them both, but her attention was on the fleeing ork with the shoulder-mounted weapon. ‘Permission to go after the greenskin?’ she said. ‘Denied,’ Augusta said. ‘Our priority is the mission. We have one Sister badly injured, and we’re running out of time. We must locate our target. Melia, did you catch it as it fled?’ ‘I believe so,’ Melia answered. ‘It wasn’t quite fast enough.’ ‘Enough that we’ll know it if we see it again,’ Akemi commented. ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘I hate to leave a loose ork roaming, and we should move location before it comes back with reinforcements. Caia, do you have a lead on the relic?’ ‘Report said it was in the casket on the nose of the Might in Vengeance,’ Caia said. ‘But we know the casket’s empty. I suggest we find the warboss’ hoard. If it’s anywhere…’ ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘Melia, can Alcina be moved?’ ‘I can move, Sister.’ Alcina’s voice was hoarse, but determined. ‘But I fear I will not be swift.’ ‘Truly, the Emperor is with you, Sister Alcina,’ Augusta commented, a smile in her tone. ‘You are made of His mettle.’ With a groan, the squad’s second came to her feet, staggered, righted herself. The hole in her armour was impressive, but beneath it, Melia’s skills had stopped her bleeding. ‘He is with all of us,’ Alcina answered. ‘Now, if the holy thigh bone of Saint Finiang is here, then we had better regroup, and seek it swiftly.’",

      "content": "Grimdak liked stomping. It wasn’t that he was big, exactly; the boss was bigger. But Grimdak was smart. Grimdak knew all the best places, all the best scraps and corners and heaps of junk. An’ besides, the boss wasn’t out here, and right now, that made Grimdak the biggest ork there was. Da biggest ork on da walkway. That, and his deffgun was the bestest. Stamping down the rusting, rotting tunnels of the great hulk, his muscled shoulders catching on hanging cables and old supports, his red eyes looking for the shiny, Grimdak liked the weight it gave him. He’d made it himself, because of course he had, scavenging the ruin for some bits, trading what he found for others. Razgog’d even let him use the mekboy workshop, so long as he did some of the welding and cutting. And that meant his deffgun was ginormous. It made him heavier, stronger. And it made his stomping loud, his boots bashing good on the metal. He liked the echoes, the banging percussion that said: Da ork is comin’! Faded lumens flickered at the noise, showering sparks as he passed them; they made shadows jump along the walls, shapes like threats. As his own outline fell ahead of him, he let off a burst of rounds, just because he could. It boomed and roared and deafened him, but he liked it. He liked the spank of the ricochets, the big explosions that bellowed back from the far end of the tunnel. He liked the creaking and the smashing that came after. They told everything to get outta da bleedin’ way! Yaaah! His deffgun was good, turning anything to a greasy smear. Carrying it, Grimdak wasn’t scared of nothing. Not those big scuttlies – fast, but not fast enough. Not those poncy, prancy things with their stupid hair, or those ranks of boring robots. Grimdak’d even seen a Space Marine once, hiding his backside in all that snazzy armour. Hadn’t done him any good – the boss still wore his pauldrons. Remembering the battle, he snickered round his teeth. That’d been a big one, but Zoldag Legmangla, warboss, had claimed this hulk for the Deathskullz, and he wasn’t giving it up. The Space Marine’s skull, helmet and all, sat atop the warboss’ throne. And his boyz’d never had it so good. Two levels down and a big bag of loot later, Grimdak stopped by a ruined control panel. Its screen was shattered, half chewed off; its wires hung loose. They were red and gleaming, spilled like guts, and he knew that colour of metal. Razgog needed it, it was good stuff for fixing busted connections. Yanking the front fully off the thing, he poked it with a curious talon, waiting to see if it’d catapult him back down the walkway… Was slightly disappointed when nothing happened. In the stomp-free quiet, however, he heard a noise. A noise like boots. Big boots. Grimdak stopped. Legmangla’s Skullz owned the hulk, but them was boots, all right. Loud boots, metal boots. Boots that moved all tidy-like. Military boots. Not as big as the Space Marine, but big enough. They were still some distance away, somewhere down by the old genny-rators, he reckoned. But he was sure of one thing… Them boots weren’t orks. He frowned, scratching hard at one metal-pierced ear. Bits of snotling were still caught in it, but he wasn’t worried about that now. Fink, he told himself. The boss’ hulk was called Da Big Mouf and it was bleedin’ huge. It was more than one ship, all smushed together and stuck like that, roaring on though the void. It had lots of different ends and bits, sticking out all over the place, plus the central vortex that had given it its name – something to do with the tangled gravities of the individual ships. The boss’ throne was a way back, on the biggest command deck; the escape pods were used by the mekboyz; and old Skalagrog preached and sparked and ranted his way through the lower tunnels. Even the gunnery decks, used for sleeping and eating and fighting, were– Them boots were getting closer. He scratched his ear a bit harder, then inspected his claw and chewed the filth out of it. He was too big to sneak, and, anyhow, that wasn’t the way. He was an ork, the biggest baddest ork on the walkway. With the biggest, baddest deffgun. Yeah! Da loota wiv da shoota! Hoiking the thing a bit higher on his shoulder, he folded down the targeter and kicked in the scanners. I is da big ork! An’ I is gonna finds ya! The boots were a level below him, he reckoned, down in the old helot tunnels where some of the mangled servitors still roamed, every one of them mad as a bucket of snotlings. Sometimes, if he needed the really good swag, he went down there after them. The ladder was nearby, and though its rungs were busted, he’d be able to see straight down. Yeah, like shootin’ humies in a barrel! Grinning though his snaggled fangs, he stomped that way. And then, he heard something else. Arriving back at the warboss’ throne, Grimdak skidded to a stop in a state of almost-panic. ‘Boss!’ He was pointing frenziedly behind him, though the deffgun made it almost impossible for him to turn. ‘We gots trouble! I see’d ’em! Dey’s comin’, an’ dey got boltas, an’ shootas an’ ’eavy fings. An’ fings dat…’ Catching Legmangla’s lava-eyed glare, he shut his mouth. Backed up a prudent step. Framed by a wealth of trophies, the warboss unfolded to his feet. Zoldag was huge, his shoulders fully big enough to fill the yellow pauldrons, his ears heavy with scavenged metal. Parts of his armour were made from black chitin, and he bore a necklace of mismatched skulls. His filed teeth were tipped in sharpened steel and covered in shreds of Gork-alone-knew-what. And his left arm was fully augmetic, ending in a four-taloned claw bigger than Grimdak’s head. The claw had come from a Dreadnought. And Grimdak should know – he’d found the bleedin’ thing. At the warboss’ feet, a twitching gretchin stood ready to run his errands. ‘You wot?’ Legmangla rumbled, a bubbling snarl that started deep in his chest. It echoed round the throne room’s crumbling panels like a rolling boulder. Words tripping over themselves, Grimdak tried to explain. ‘Dey… dey’s humies, boss, an’ dey gots all the armour. Shiny. Yeah, good. But dey was singin’…’ He got no further. The warboss gave a rippling roar, the noise enough to make the gretchin cower and cover its ears. Grimdak gulped, but refused to let himself flinch. Good thing too, as the boss idly booted the smaller creature and sent it sailing into an upper support. It squeaked in protest, crunched with the impact and crashed to the floor. It didn’t move again. Stamping down three steps, Legmangla fixed Grimdak with a baleful, scarlet glower. ‘You runned away. You saw da humies, an’ you runned away.’ He bared his fangs, his breath reeking. ‘Is you an ork, or is you a stinkin’, snivellin’ grot?’ ‘I is an ork, boss.’ Grimdak backed up another step. ‘I… I jus’ came to tells ya! Bring ya da newz. An’ I gots…’ With his best ingratiating grin, he grabbed a fistful of his captured swag, and held it out. The boss paused, eyeing the copper wire. On the floor between them, at the foot of his seat, lay his huge pile of scavenged booty – more bits of Space Marine and Dreadnought, the claws of a genestealer, the plume from an aeldari helm. The Apothecary’s narthecium, his proudest possession. It glinted like an evil grin. Legmangla eyed the wires, then the pile, then rumbled again, apparently thinking. Then he bellowed, loud enough to rattle the ancient glass screens. ‘Baz!’ Grimdak backed up even further, smack into the ork behind him. He jumped, turned. And there was Bazruk da Stompa, ork nob, casually picking his fangs with a long and dirty spike. He leered down, grinning. ‘Awright, loota?’ His words were easy, dangerous. ‘Wot’s you done now?’ ‘Nuffink,’ Grimdak said quickly, scrambling out of the way. Bazruk’s grin grew. Behind him, more orks tumbled into the chamber, nobz and boyz, weapons in hands. A scatter of gretchin came with them, darting between their feet and trying not to get stomped on. Bazruk snarled at the massed pack, and it scuffled and shoved to quiet, waiting. Legmangla eyed his troops. ‘Awright,’ he said. ‘Grimdak’s gots us somethin’ speshal.’ He grinned, a mouthful of knives. ‘Dere’s humies in da tunnels, an’ dey gots da good loot. An’ by the teefs of Gork an’ Mork, we’s gonna finds ’em an’ we’s gonna stamp on their ’eads. We’s gonna breaks dem outta dere shells, and squish all dere pink insides.’ The grin grew. ‘An’ I’s gonna gets meself a bran’ new prize.’ He threw a thumb over his shoulder, at the helm that topped the throne. ‘A li’l one, ta go by da big one.’ Orks nudged each other, snickering. But Legmangla’s grin vanished. Fangs bared, his red gaze moved from ork to ork like a laser sight. It settled on Grimdak. ‘But,’ he said. ‘Before we gets stuck in, you tell me somethin’.’ Greenskins eyed each other, their boots. Not one of them met the warboss’ gaze. Still glaring at Grimdak, he said, ‘Oo founds da relic?’ Grimdak blinked. ‘Wot?’ ‘Relic?’ Mutters and shuffles; each ork glared at his nearest neighbours. ‘Wot relic?’ Leaning casually on the nearest upright, Bazruk continued to pick his teeth. Greatly daring, Grimdak answered, ‘We ain’t gots no relics, boss.’ He pointed at the throne, the pile. ‘All da good stuff’s dere. No relics!’ ‘Dem singin’ humies, dey always come afta da relics,’ Legmangla said, his tone spelling it out. He fixed Grimdak with a nasty stare, and Grimdak gulped. He had no idea if Legmangla could swallow the deffgun as well as the ork that carried it, and he didn’t want to find out. After all, look at what’d happened to ol’ Scarmush. Never mind that now. Bristling, Legmangla stomped down the last two steps. Still framed by the loot-encrusted throne-back, his pile of his swag at his boots, he made a swipe at where Grimdak was standing. The loota jumped out the way, but Legmangla’s grab had not been aimed at him. Bazruk cursed as the toothpick was snatched from his hand. ‘’Ere! Dat’s…!’ The boss growled him to silence, examined the spike, then shook it, right in Bazruk’s face. ‘Wot’s dis, den?’ he roared. ‘Da ’and of bleedin’ Mork?’ Faced by the boss, even Bazruk backed up. He looked around him for support, but every other ork in the room was studiously staring elsewhere. ‘I… Uh…’ The boss shook it again. ‘Where’d ya gets dis?’ ‘Dere was a coffin?’ Bazruk ventured. ‘Big stone fing? Out near da mouf–’ With a roar, Legmangla lunged. He drove the toothpick, sharp end first, straight through the hollow of Baz’s throat. Bazruk gawked, startled, then went over backwards with a crash. He gagged, choked, kicked, and was still. Gore seeped out across the slatted metal floor. Orks chuckled and snorted; a few kicked at the downed body, just for good measure. But Legmangla was not laughing. With a bellow, he brought the boyz to stillness. ‘When you gets da loot, you brings it ’ere!’ One massive boot kicked the glinting pile. ‘You gots that? You don’ts use it ta picks ya teef!’ Bazruk’s toothpick was now stuck straight up in the air like a monument, marking where the nob’s stupidity had ended. Its blunt end, Grimdak realised, was the familiar round hip joint of an ancient, humie thigh bone. And, while he couldn’t read them, the thing was engraved with words, all the way down. ‘Oops,’ he commented, when Legmangla couldn’t hear. ‘WAAAGH!’ Bellowing, bristling with weapons, the boyz surged out of the airlock door, running straight for the main companionway. Grimdak had tried to sidle from the boss’ line of sight, but Legmangla grabbed him by one ear, and dragged him right up the front. ‘You found ’em,’ he said. ‘You go finds ’em again.’ ‘Boss.’ In the deffgun, he had a motion detector, of sorts. It was a bit twitchy – picked up the bilge rats sometimes – but it was enough. With Legmangla pounding beside him, and a surge of gleeful greenskins behind, he ran. We gonna krush dem humies good an’ propa! At first, however, the hulk seemed empty. Covered in the orks’ garish graffiti, it clanged and bashed and echoed to the sounds of their charge, creaking and groaning. Squeaky things scattered from the orks’ boots; they stamped at them, laughing. Junctions and ladders were daubed with colours and pictures and warnings, with the skull symbols of their tribe and with caricatures of its various members. In other places, old Skalagrog had sent up warnings, standing totems of bones and captured booty. Marking the parts of Legmangla’s territory, they said: Don’t mess wiv da orks! Skalagrog himself had joined them, though the rest of the tribe were giving him a wide berth. More than one ork had met a sizzle-fried end when ol’ Skalagrog got carried away. They sang as they ran: ‘Mash ’em, bash ’em! Crunch ’em, munch ’em! We da boyz, an’ we lives ’ere! Fite ’em, smite ’em! Beats ’em, eats ’em! We da boyz, we gots no fear!’ As they chanted, they pushed and shoved, mocking and jostling. Bazruk’s demise had left a gap, and the biggest of the remaining orks were eager to fill it. At the back, a few voices started raggedly shouting, ‘’Ere we go, ’ere we go, ’ere we go!’ Grimdak, however, didn’t join the fun. His feet bashed to the main rhythm, but he was watching the motion detector in his flip-down eyepiece. Nuffink. Occasional, scuttling blips – more rats, and a distance away; there was nothing big enough, or well-ordered enough, to be the force he’d seen. And he could feel the close, watchful rumble of Legmangla’s authority. It said: Don’t get dis wrong, loota. The tribe continued to chant: ‘Thump ’em, whump ’em! Crash ’em, bash ’em! We da boyz, an’ we’s awright! Tromp ’em, stomp ’em! Smack ’em, whack ’em! We da boyz, an’ we can fight!’ Steadily, the companion-route led out into the main body of the hulk. The graffiti faded back to red and gnawing rust, and the lumens grew weaker, casting almost no light. Around them, the space soon opened out into a vast and looming darkness, and their boots rang hollow on the now suspended walkway. A cold and empty wind began to pluck at them, teasing. It stank of dead stuff. Here, Grimdak wanted to slow down. He was smart, right; he knew the hulk better than his mates, and he knew that they were heading for the central hub, for the point where the vast ships all collided. He’d seen it many times, all the tunnels that led up and out and away, and at impossibly bonkers angles that just hurt your brain… And out there, in the middle of it all, was the thing that Legmangla had called the ‘mouf’. It was ever-hungry, the place where everything twisted, round and round, pulling everything down into itself. Grimdak didn’t know where the stuff went, though Razgog had once tried to explain to him. He did know, though, that more than one ork had got too close, trying to prove how scared he wasn’t, and had gone bawling over the railings. It wasn’t long before they all felt the change, the charge, the sucking greed in the air. ‘Fink you’s big, wiv all dat noize? Gots news for youz, ’cause we’s DA BOYZ!’ The chant reached its end, bled out into the open darkness. The air was full of sounds: phantom yells, cries that they couldn’t quite hear, the creak and grind of unsettled metal. The orks turned grim, stamping fast and focused, their faces furrowed, fangs bared. Yeah, Grimdak thought, as they closed on the location of the vortex. Mouf or no mouf, dey wuz ready. The ambush hit them hard. Grimdak had not seen motion; there was only the sudden flare of muzzle flash, the boom of heavy weapons, the rip and roar of carbide fusion rounds, cutting through air and flesh and metal. And singing, the sort of powerful, humie tunes that could only mean one thing. The loota bellowed a warning, but the noise was lost in the racket. Cries, shrieks, shouts. Detonations, sudden splotches of exploding warmth. Flying flesh. Tumbling bodies. Orks cursing and colliding, the confused bang of their boots and the screeches of crushed gretchin. The whoosh of a handheld flamer. Burning boyz, stumbling into each other or from the walkway’s edge. Falling, flailing sideways as the vortex took them and gobbled them down. The spang of a snapped cable and the walkway lurching, knocking boyz from their feet… Grimdak stayed upright, his legs splayed apart, riding the slewing metal with knees like gimbals; his motion detector was blipping, movement ahead and behind. Two, four, six dots. Six? Dat was all? But the ambush had been well placed. Here, the bridge was curving through a right angle, avoiding the sick, dark whirl of the mouf, and the boyz were straggled out, all around the curve. Illuminated only by erratic flashes of gunfire, Grimdak could just make out the attackers, a distance back. Three at the front, their ceramite armour gleaming darkly scarlet, their cloaks in black and white, and flapping in the vortex’s wind. ‘WAAAGH!’ Legmangla bawled the command. Howling, the orks attacked. The bark and roar of weapons fire, the flash of axes in the half-light. Right at the front, Grimdak targeted the deffgun. The boss thundered past him, claw champing, his captured tech-priest choppa ready in his other hand. With a yell of his own, the loota opened fire. The weapon boomed, the noise incredible; it crashed back from the metalwork like some vast, steel drumbeat. The red-clad figure in front of him was smaller than the others; he could see the distinctive pattern of its helmet, its bolter held hard in both hands. His suppression went over the humie as it dropped neatly sideways, then rolled back up, still shooting. Behind it, explosions blossomed, the flames sucked away by the vortex’s pull. The walkway shivered, quaked again. The whirl sucked and crackled and spat. Eager. Starving. Grimdak roared, bared his teeth. ‘We iz da orks!’ In the bad light, it was almost impossible to see. There were bodies everywhere, orks shooting back, orks falling down. Bolter rounds struck the loota and spanged, repelled by the deffgun’s shoulder-mount. He juddered at the impacts, but he didn’t go over. Sparks burned his cheek. Shouts were rising now, boots crashing in an upsurge of defiance. ‘We owns da hulk!’ ‘We’s gonna krush!’ ‘Stompin’ an’ shootin’! Stompin’ an’ shootin’!’ Ahead of Grimdak, Legmangla hurled his full body weight at the central armoured figure, bigger than the other two. The figure let off a shot with the bolter, then stepped from the warboss’ path. With a tidy throw-and-catch, it reversed its grip on its weapon and slammed the butt sideways into the ork’s face. Snarling, Legmangla lashed out with the choppa, simultaneously slamming the claw into the figure’s chestplate, then opening it out to gouge a screaming hole in the metal. In the flashes, Grimdak could make out the third figure, a flamer in its gauntleted hands. The singing continued, like knives in Grimdak’s brain. ‘Down!’ he yelled, and the warboss ducked. The flamer’s gout missed him, and torched the two orks behind. A detonation of ammunition was sucked away by the mouf. But Grimdak only glanced; he didn’t have time to waste. He heard shouts, crashing, smashing, roaring, shooting, pandemonium. Another cable spanged, the walkway lurched again. He could hear Skalagrog chanting, feel the flicker and flash of his gathering power, fed by the other orks. Mork alone knew what good that would do… ‘Grim!’ The boss’ command was a bark. ‘Go gets da big shoota!’ ‘Boss!’ Understanding, Grimdak dropped back towards the corner. In front of him, Legmangla executed his signature move, stamping sideways on his enemy’s knee, and snapping it clean, armour and all. The figure went over, but still managed to reverse its grip, again, on the weapon and shoot upwards at the boss’ head. It missed. The flamer roared again, the wash of its heat enough to crisp the hairs in Grimdak’s nose. The flames, like everything else, were sucked sideways and away. Then a roaring gaggle of boyz broke past him, heading for the attackers, and he was abruptly caught in the centre of the mêlée. And Mork’s teef, it was a mess. There were orks everywhere, getting in his way, tripping him over as he tried to move. They were confused, some injured, some dying; the pull of the air was tugging them all towards the walkway’s now-dangling edge. In some places, they fought back, bawling defiance; in others they struggled with the fall, or with each other. Gretchin scampered here and there, some of them trying to fight, others chortling gleefully and looting their downed comrades. One squeaked protest as the hulk’s mouf took him; he was a thrashing silhouette, and then he was gone. Somewhere, Grimdak could hear the roar and whip-crack of their herder, demanding that they ‘Attack da humies!’ Somewhere else, there was still Skalagrog, crackling like a bared wire, now, and ready to throw his bright and unstable energy in all directions… But hey, it meant that Grimdak could see. Kicking at a grabbing green hand, he turned the corner fully. And found turmoil. Three more figures were standing at the back of the ambushed tribe, one with a running chainsword, another with a heavy bolter, aimed from the hip, and all covered in shiny symbols. One part of his brain jumped up and down at the find, desperately wanting to grab the things and get them back to the workshop – the stuffs that Razgog could make! – but the other part was smarter, and could see the devastation that the weapon had made. Even as he looked, there was a bellow, and four of the biggest nobz charged straight at the attackers. The one with the heavy weapon dropped back, still firing, then clunked to a halt. The figure swore. The first two orks were caught by the suppression; they shuddered at repeated impacts, skidding to the floor. Another went down to the third figure, a shot going clean through his forehead. Ragbad, unhurt, surged forwards. But the figure with the chainsword came to meet him, and Grimdak stopped. Though not as big as the one Legmangla had charged, it moved like pure, tight hostility, smooth and furious. Sneering, Ragbad raised his forearm to block, and the blade just carved straight through, shrieking briefly as it cut the bone. Rag screeched like failing steel, but kept going, trying to leap on the figure and bear it to the ground. ‘Yaaaa! I don’t needs me arm anyhowz!’ The figure stepped back, bringing the chainsword up, two-handed, and cutting him almost clear in half, armour and all. For a split second, Grimdak stopped, gawking. But Legmangla was still up, still bellowing ‘WAAAGH!’ Belatedly, the loota opened fire; hit all three figures with a full suppression. The heavy weapon was down, changing magazine; he saw his own rounds spark from the thing, flashes of violent orange. They chewed a line across the user’s armour, throwing it backwards. It screamed at him, savage, rolling back to its feet. ‘Domine! Libra Nos!’ He bellowed back, ‘I iz da bestest ork! Da loota wiv da shoota!’ With a cry like pure rage, the figure with the chainsword came forwards, the weapon still running, sending flicks of Rag’s gore to spatter against the metalwork. Grimdak lowered the muzzle of the deffgun and hit it with a full, directed burst– The deffgun jammed. ‘Mork’s teef!’ he cursed, backing up fast. More of the tribe surged past him, Skalagrog included. The enemy bolter took out one target, two, then was buried by a pile of green. But Grimdak wasn’t looking, he was trying to unjam the– Skalagrog struck. A blaze of static energy exploded on the walkway, its lightning slanting towards the vortex. In response, the deffgun crackled and sparked, and the motion detector in his eyepiece went dead. ‘Wot’s you doin’, you–’ The full blaze of Skalagrog’s fury hit the chainsword figure in the chest. The figure stood stock-still for moment, its armour sputtering, smoking at the shoulders and ablaze with every colour Grimdak could name… ‘Yaaaa!’ Somewhere, Legmangla was still shouting; Grimdak couldn’t turn but he figured the boss was ripping his way through the enemy, breaking legs and heads. The flamethrower coughed again, a wide arc of fire. Gretchin screamed, fell. Their flesh aflame, they were everywhere and underfoot. More of them were tumbling from the walkway now, being sucked sideways into the vortex. And the vortex… The mouf was growing. Grimdak didn’t understand it, and Razgog wasn’t there to ask, but the lightning flashes of old Skalagrog’s energies were being sucked sideways, just like the fallen orks. And the mouf was getting bigger, tugging at hair and pulling flame and smoke and flesh down into its ever-churning belly. And then, the unthinkable happened. Grimdak didn’t see it, but he heard the noise. A third spang as another cable snapped, and the walkway lurched again, now swinging dangerously in the vortex’s winds. Impossible corridor angles led away in all directions; they messed with his head, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was the roar of rage as Legmangla lost his footing. The walkway itself was twisting, now, screeching in protest; it hurt Grimdak’s eyes to look at it. Then something massive skidded past him, grappling for hold, and went straight off the walkway’s edge. With a gawp of disbelief, Grimdak saw Legmangla shoot past him, swearing. But the boss didn’t fall. The Dreadnought claw lashed out, grabbed the railing, and hung on. He swung there, over the drop. The walkway creaked and groaned at the boss’ massive weight, twisting even further. More and more orks were losing their footing now, shrieking obscenities. Skalagrog was sliding. Grimdak, too. Legmangla hung over the drop, kicking his boots, snarling in outrage. From the armoured enemy, a barked command. Responding instantly, the heavy weapon opened fire – straight down. For an instant, Grimdak didn’t realise what they were doing, but he caught himself up as the rounds chewed holes in the metal, and the part the orks were standing on started to come away. The walkway screamed as it tore, the noise cutting at his ears. His deffgun was too heavy. Any bleedin’ minute…! Grimdak had a split second to make a decision. In front of him, the three attackers were now standing on a stable steel platform, its edge cut free. The vortex was growing, reaching out hungrily as more orks slipped towards it. Skalagrog’s lightnings seemed to be feeding it, somehow, making it– No time, Grimdak told himself. You’s da smart ork. Fink! To the front, one of the figures was tending to their downed mate; the other one, the small one, was covering, bolter ready. As he glanced, he saw the bolter was aimed at the still-dangling warboss, his claw slammed closed on the creaking railing. And Legmangla’s huge weight was pulling the whole walkway down. Cut free at its other end, it was starting to hinge like a door… Grimdak couldn’t back up – the walkway was broken and the heavy weapon would cut him to pieces. He had to go forwards… Jump! Legmangla caught his gaze and said something, the words torn away by the vortex. But Grimdak was past caring. There was an old ork saying, he remembered, one that Razgog lived by. Not the biggest ork in the tribe, the mekboy was definitely the smartest – he wasn’t out here, for a start. ‘Bestest way to win when dere’s too many?’ Raz had once said. ‘S’called da Air Gap Teknik.’ ‘Wot?’ Grimdak had asked him. ‘Air gap, clunk-brain. Da bigger da betta.’ Fink, Grimdak told himself, again. Razgog had been right – he knew what to do. And besides, the mekboy was still in the workshop, and Grim knew the hulk – he could circle back around the mouf, back to the warboss’ chambers… Pick up the relic. The good loot. Warbosses came and went, but Grim… yeah, he always survived. I iz da smart ork. Letting off a single, suppressive volley at the three figures, he made them keep their heads down. Then he jumped, right for their position. They swore, swinging weapons to cover him, but he was fast, deffgun or not. He broke past the bolter-figure and the crouched one with the flamer, and he just ran for it. As he did so, he heard the massive screeching creak as the railing finally gave way and Legmangla tumbled, howling, towards the vortex. He didn’t know what had happened to Skalagrog and he didn’t pause to worry. He put his head down, and he ran. Behind him, the figures were moving. A bolter round whisked past his ear; he heard the cough of the flamer, felt it singe his skin. Flames chasing him down the tunnel, Grimdak made his escape. ‘Well, Sisters?’ Her armour still crackling, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus switched off the chainsword’s mechanism. Viola, despite the line of dents in her chestplate, was covering the still-whirling vortex; Caia was checking the auspex for anything else incoming. On the far side of the now-fallen walkway, Sister Alcina was down. Melia was on one knee beside her, sanguinator in hand. Akemi covered them both, but her attention was on the fleeing ork with the shoulder-mounted weapon. ‘Permission to go after the greenskin?’ she said. ‘Denied,’ Augusta said. ‘Our priority is the mission. We have one Sister badly injured, and we’re running out of time. We must locate our target. Melia, did you catch it as it fled?’ ‘I believe so,’ Melia answered. ‘It wasn’t quite fast enough.’ ‘Enough that we’ll know it if we see it again,’ Akemi commented. ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘I hate to leave a loose ork roaming, and we should move location before it comes back with reinforcements. Caia, do you have a lead on the relic?’ ‘Report said it was in the casket on the nose of the Might in Vengeance,’ Caia said. ‘But we know the casket’s empty. I suggest we find the warboss’ hoard. If it’s anywhere…’ ‘Agreed,’ Augusta said. ‘Melia, can Alcina be moved?’ ‘I can move, Sister.’ Alcina’s voice was hoarse, but determined. ‘But I fear I will not be swift.’ ‘Truly, the Emperor is with you, Sister Alcina,’ Augusta commented, a smile in her tone. ‘You are made of His mettle.’ With a groan, the squad’s second came to her feet, staggered, righted herself. The hole in her armour was impressive, but beneath it, Melia’s skills had stopped her bleeding. ‘He is with all of us,’ Alcina answered. ‘Now, if the holy thigh bone of Saint Finiang is here, then we had better regroup, and seek it swiftly.’",

      "content": "Lightning tore through the sky. Seen through the cathedral’s massive glassaic window, it was a pure and holy wrath, flashing His image to brilliance. ‘O most Holy Emperor, grant to our Sister eternal rest!’ Beneath Him, at the altar, the slight, grey-robed form of the canoness raised her arms to His glory, her voice in the sacred requiem. Rolls of thunder joined her words, rumbling at the building’s walls, beating down upon its high and vaulted roof. ‘Let the light of your Throne shine upon her!’ Below the elderly figure, her congregation were mesmerised. In the foremost pew, helm off and head bowed as was proper, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus suppressed a shiver at His manifest might. His storm reigned perpetual, here on this tiny, forgotten world. ‘Hear my prayer, O Emperor. To you, all lives are owed! To you, all flesh must come!’ The requiem was unaccompanied – no organ, no music. Its harmonies were dense but unfamiliar, twisting through the acoustics in an eerie, minor key. Sister Akemi, to Augusta’s left side, shifted, shot a glance along the pew at Sister Melia. The storm grumbled on, like the anger in grief. Behind Augusta’s squad, the Sisters of the canoness’ Order and their frateris militia raised their own voices, responding to the litany. ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ The service was a funeral. Despatched by the Ecclesiarchy and newly arrived upon Letum, Augusta had not known the young Sister who had passed to His grace. She’d had no time to speak to the canoness personally; instead, she had respectfully agreed to attend the service. But this… The image in the great Sol-facing window was not Him in His full glory, armoured and bearing His bright and flaming sword – it was Him as He would be, ancient and enthroned in cables. Before it, four ancient servo-skulls hovered like guardians, their metal corroded, but their green eyes sharp as gemstones. She could not shake the feeling that they watched her, analysing what they saw. Carefully, she honoured the hymn, though the responses were unknown. ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ The lightning flashed again, causing His image to blaze, for a split second, out across the nave, almost like He had been there in person. Chilled to the absolute bone by the undisciplined thought, Augusta offered a penitent prayer. Such was arrogance, and unforgiveable. This place was unsettling, true, but that was not a justification. Sister Viola, always the hothead, cursed under her breath. Alcina, the squad’s second-in-command, snapped the ghost of an order and Viola subsided. But Augusta’s odd, visceral shudder did not. Tiny and isolated, cut off by His never-ceasing storm, the Sisters of this convent were completely unknown. They wore no armour, their robes and cloaks were a beautifully embroidered grey, and rather than a fleur-de-lys, their faces were tattooed with the outline of a skull. They called themselves the Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. Letum was a cemetery planet, a world of gravestones and towering, carved sarcophagi. In millennia past, it had been a resting place for the Imperium’s most honoured dead, and a silent, stone civilisation had grown out around its endless corpses – spreading grids of sunken walkways, shrines and chapels like ossuaries, all studded with bones, locked reliquaries where only He still remembered their contents. Once, pilgrims had come here, to study the headstones or to tend to them – but no pilgrim had touched this world in centuries. Not since the coming of the storm and its restless, magnetic field. Any ship attempting to land here would be brought down by His lightning. The Imperium’s bureaucracy had known this, but Letum had little intrinsic value – no wealth or resources. Lost somewhere between endless scriveners, and now both unreachable and unimportant, it had been abandoned, and left to its veneration of death. Augusta stole a look upward, her head still bowed, her bobbed hair falling grey past her ears. Atop the altar, as grey as everything else, lay an open coffin; within it, the young Sister who had passed. The coffin was steel, beautifully wrought and etched in skulls; at either end, a conducting rod connected it to the cathedral’s outside wall. The thunder growled low, like anticipation. With the sound, the congregation’s expectancy rose. The canoness still prayed, her arms aloft, her words a torch, a hymn, a tocsin. ‘He comes!’ she said, her tone livid with passion. ‘Let us witness the touch of His light!’ Perhaps the flash of His image had been less arrogance, Augusta thought, and more a deliberate illustration of this convent’s empathic belief. But still, her shudder did not fade. She should have more discipline. Praying, she focused her thoughts. The canoness’ voice rose further. She had her congregation gripped, the three pews of her Sisters, the frateris further back. Her head tilted back, strands of her white hair floating upwards round her face, she was entreating His storm for its touch, calling it to her. And, much as Augusta tried to banish the unworthy thought, the storm seemed to be listening. The flashes, vivid and shocking, were coming closer; the gap between the light and the sound narrowed with every strike. Even as the Sister Superior stole another look, a crashing rumble of thunder sounded directly overhead. There was the sudden hiss of rain against the glassaic. The canoness cried, ‘Bring mercy! Release our Sister to your storm!’ Propelled, the congregation were on their feet. They returned her words, but their cries were staccato, now, scattered throughout the nave and rapidly becoming louder. Frenzy rang from them like the clashing of cymbals. ‘Release!’ ‘Have mercy!’ ‘He comes!’ Uneasy, Sister Viola flashed a look over her shoulder. As Augusta glanced sideways, she crossed gazes with the younger Sister’s bright green eyes, saw flickers of both concern and non-comprehension. Briefly, Viola raised an eyebrow, but Augusta only frowned, indicating that she should attend to her prayers. The canoness cried again, ‘He comes!’ ‘He comes!’ ‘Praise His lightning!’ ‘Praise it!’ Another flash. Another bellow, loud enough to shake the bell towers. Augusta prayed, then found herself catching her breath… For here, even as His image flashed down upon the altar itself, bright yellow crackled along the conducting rods, a spark like pure, bared adrenaline. The congregation cried aloud, one long, ‘Ah!’ And light detonated from the metal coffin. It was blinding, but the Sister Superior held her place, blinking the after-flash from her vision. His touch was gone. Instead, flames were crackling, warm and soft, from the coffin’s contents. There was the faint smell of burning wood and flesh; grey smoke curled, thick and greasy. Extractors hummed, though she could not see them. The still-hovering skulls glittered in new firelight. They grinned, wide and toothy, as though they had seen this a thousand times, yet had never tired of it. As though they knew secrets they would never tell. ‘By the Throne…’ Shaken, Viola swore again, her words a whisper. This time, neither Alcina nor Augusta corrected her. Whatever this funeral service was, the squad had never seen its like. The storm crashed in violent farewell, then, slowly, began to rumble away. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ voice was calm with authority, soft with age. Sitting by a polished table of real wood, its surface reflecting electro-candles and the red light of the hearth, she was a tiny figure, creased with the weight of years. ‘Milady,’ Augusta answered respectfully. ‘Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, Order of the Bloody Rose.’ She offered the sign of the aquila. ‘Ave Imperator.’ Following the recessional, the canoness had bade them follow in her footsteps. The walk through the bone-walled cloisters had been as unnerving as everything else, but the librarium was warm and the storm kept at bay by the thickness of both walls and curtains. ‘Indeed,’ the canoness said. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior. His blessing upon you, and upon your squad. You will forgive me, I hope, for insisting that you attend our service? Sister Clara was very dear to me, as novice and as tender both, and while I know she kneels now at the foot of the Great Throne, I confess that I shall miss her.’ She smiled, the expression gentle. ‘His ways are strange, are they not?’ At Augusta’s left shoulder, Alcina answered, ‘It is not our place to question them, milady.’ ‘Of course, of course.’ Without losing her smile, the canoness gestured for the Sister to subside. ‘Yet I find that age has brought a… certain restlessness to my soul. It is unusual for anyone, upon our world so tiny, to live to the years that I have done. And I find myself lonely, eagerly awaiting my turn for His greatest blessing.’ To Augusta’s other side, Melia and Caia, one as dusky as the other was blonde, exchanged a glance. They were close as blood-kin, had come up through the schola together – the nearness of the canoness to her friend would touch them deeply. Sister Viola, here bereft of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter, creaked as she shifted on her toes; the last and youngest member of the squad, Sister Akemi, was gazing raptly round at the bookshelves, lured by the promise of previously unseen lore. But Augusta was focused on the canoness. ‘Milady, it was our honour to attend your service, though its litanies were unfamiliar. You will forgive our lack of knowledge in not responding – no insult was intended.’ ‘And none was taken, Sister Superior.’ The canoness gestured at her servitors, which were laying tiny, perfect plates upon the table, each one offering some sort of fungus-based pastries. With a quiet bow, the grey-hooded figures withdrew. ‘Now, you must tell me of your Order – I have seen such armour only in my books, and yet here it is, the colour of new blood. And you must tell me why He has brought you here, Sister, to my little convent, so long untouched by the Imperium’s… warriors.’ There was an odd stress on the word ‘warriors’, but this was an uncharted corner of the void in more ways than one. Navigating carefully, Augusta offered no correction of the term. Instead, she said, ‘We seek a ship, milady, crash-landed upon your world. It bears a sacred text that I am charged to retrieve.’ ‘A ship?’ The elderly lady put her head to one side, almost birdlike in fine-boned fragility. Her white hair, neatly bunned but loose tendrils still crackling with remembered electricity, gleamed in the hearth-light, and her skull outline seemed oddly prominent, for all its age. ‘Sister Superior, no ships come to this world, crashed or otherwise. He has decreed our isolation, and we are gladly alone, caretakers of this, His most holy cemetery.’ Lines round her eyes crinkled with affection or wariness. ‘Truly, we are the servants of His last and greatest blessing.’ Viola opened her mouth, realised the answer, shut it again. But the canoness’ perception was sharp. ‘Our release, my fire-haired Sister. Our blessed ascension to the Great Throne, where we may at last witness His suspension and His glory. Truly, there is no greater gift.’ Her words glittered, dark and ardent. ‘He is the ultimate expression of the faith of my Order. The visage of death.’ At the word, thunder grumbled, and the canoness turned away to gaze upon the storm. Alcina shifted, but Augusta flicked a hand, discreetly and by her hip. Over the tight-beam vox-link, she subvocalised, ‘We must tread carefully, Sister. This place unsettles me, and I do not know why.’ ‘I hear you.’ Alcina’s response was laden with tension. Akemi was still staring at the books, her head turning sideways to read their spines. ‘You are a scholar?’ The canoness addressed the youngest Sister, making her start and turn back. ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Mmm.’ The old woman studied Akemi’s shining black hair, her pale skin, the relative newness of her fleur-de-lys tattoo. Like the skulls, she seemed to be analysing what she saw. ‘There is much lore here,’ she said. ‘It has been gathered from many places upon this world. Like my Sisters of this Order, our frateris militia have little use for combat. In place of such training, they tend to the headstones and shrines, as is proper, while we perform His ancient rites here, in the Great Cathedral. Sometimes, they bring to us things for which we must care – books, particularly, are vulnerable to the storm.’ There was something in her tone, an edge, the faintest hint of some deep curiosity. Akemi responded, her voice respectfully even. ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness chuckled. ‘You are perfectly behaved, young one.’ She tapped thin, claw-like fingers against her cheek. ‘So, little scholar, you shall stay. You shall bless me with your lore and tell me of your Order. Explain to me your flower symbol. It is a rose, is it not?’ Akemi shot a glance at Augusta. ‘Surely, milady, the Sister Superior…?’ Again, the elderly canoness waved her hand. ‘I have already said’ – the phrase was faintly sharp, a warning of discipline – ‘that combat is of little use here. A chamber awaits you, Sister Superior, and a quiet supper will be served in the refectorium. You are welcome to join us, of course. You – Akemi, isn’t it? – you will stay.’ Brooking no argument, she turned back to the bookshelf, as if searching for something she wished to show Akemi. ‘Sister Superior?’ Akemi’s subvocalised voice came over the squad-vox, wary and requesting permission. Augusta repeated the warning she had given Alcina, then said, ‘She is canoness of her Order and we do not disobey. But speak little, Akemi, and listen to every word she offers. Ask questions, if you are permitted.’ Privately, she thanked His wisdom that the canoness had selected Akemi and not Viola. ‘We must locate our missing text. And this place perturbs me, for reasons I cannot yet fathom.’ The refectorium was a small and circular chamber, figures of saints standing about its edges, and every one with its face pared down to a skull. Some were familiar – Celestine herself was here – but there were others that Augusta did not know, perhaps representations from headstones that the frateris had found or tended. Viola fidgeted; Melia, too, seemed oddly unsettled and, after partaking of a quiet meal, the Sisters returned to their sleeping chamber still restless, their hunger satisfied but not their unease. Once their door was closed, Viola exploded with withheld tension. ‘That was no grace that I have ever heard! We offer Him thanks for our victuals, not repentance that we must live another–’ ‘Silence.’ Augusta’s response was soft, but brooked no argument. Over their private channel, she said, ‘Caia, I want a complete technical sweep of this chamber and its surrounding area, as far as your auspex can reach. And I want to know where we are in relation to the estimated crash site. Between ourselves, we will communicate only over the vox.’ ‘Very wise.’ Alcina’s tone was all warning. ‘There is much here that defies my comprehension. While each Order bears its own prayers and hymns, these Sisters behave in a way that is… unusual.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘We will await Akemi, and any insight she brings,’ Augusta said. ‘But yes, I agree. There is something deeply amiss about this place. His voice speaks in my heart, and I must listen to His warnings.’ ‘The canoness told us the Soul of Aeris didn’t crash,’ Viola agreed. ‘We know that the ship’s last communication was of the storm. And they won’t let me carry my weapon.’ The words had an edge, the source of her restlessness. ‘Not only that,’ Melia said, her tone dark. ‘But the young Sister who perished – she was barely in her twenties, and in full health. I consider it unlikely that she perished from cardiac failure, as we have been told…’ Melia was trained by the Order of Serenity, and the squad’s medicae. She gave a twitch of a shrug, and her pauldron clattered. ‘The canoness seems learned, she must know this. Which would mean that she has uttered an open falsehood, before Him, in a sermon of holy worship. This is more than “unusual”, Sisters.’ There was a twist of horror to her words. ‘This is unthinkable.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘The crash site is approximately seven miles south-south-east of here.’ Caia lowered her auspex, its green wash of light fading. ‘With the density of the storm it is plausible that the descent of the ship went unnoticed. I can tell little more from here.’ ‘And are we being observed?’ ‘Not by machine-spirits.’ ‘There are ways, and ways.’ The comment was a thought, voiced over the vox. Aloud, the Sister Superior said, ‘Come, sing with me, my Sisters. Let us celebrate our finding of this Order, so newly joined to the Adepta Sororitas. We will raise our voices in His glory, and sing our requiem for Sister Clara. Sister Alcina, if you would.’ Alcina’s voice was a deep, full contralto; it rolled almost like the storm. It also allowed Augusta to listen. Not with the vox, but with her ears. And, as the other Sisters joined the hymnal, their harmonies as clean as the cathedral’s service had been eerie, she knew. She had heard these acoustics before. The convent may not have the technology to overhear, but every word the Sisters said was echoing back through the old, stone passages, and – she would have to assume – directly to the ears of the canoness. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said, when she returned. Like the others, she kept her words over the vox. ‘I was able to glean little. I told her of the younger Orders, of Deacis VI and of the Bloody and the Sacred Rose. Of our most holy saints Mina and Arabella. But she offered little in return. She did repeat, however, that she does not believe that the Aeris crashed here. Until our arrival, they had not seen a single Imperial vessel, of any size or description, in possibly millennia.’ ‘Millennia.’ Her armour off, laid out upon its sacred mat, Augusta knelt in her under-armour, the rose-red gambeson that helped to absorb incoming blows. The squad’s briefing had been very specific – they were to find the fallen ship, and the text that it had carried. And it was not just the Aeris. As the Sisters had crossed the vast steams of the empyrean, approaching this tiny corner of space, so Augusta had taken breaks from her squad’s training to learn as much as she could about Letum and its ceaseless storm. ‘We know,’ she said, ‘that the Aeris is not the only lost ship. Merchants’ vessels have gone missing near here, though nothing large or significant. Individually, they are unnoticeable, tiny cogs in a huge machine. But, if you put enough cogs together…’ She stopped, thinking. What she was about to suggest was, at best, a lack of protocol, at worst, downright blasphemous, but His calling in her heart was strong. As strong as it had been on Lycheate, with the doomed, crazed Inquisitor Istrix – she knew that something was wrong. In her mind, she saw the image-flash of the cathedral window, the lightning casting His image upon the stone. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, I am going to do something… unwise.’ Alcina raised a faintly acerbic eyebrow, but said nothing. ‘I will do this alone, take full responsibility for my actions. If questioned, you were following my orders.’ ‘You’re not going out there,’ Caia said, ever-perceptive. ‘The force of the storm–’ ‘That is not your decision to make, Sister,’ she answered, with a warning eyebrow. ‘I will not take my armour, it will make far too much noise. I will take my bolter, however, though only as a precaution. The canoness was right about one thing – there is no need for combat. Whatever else this place may be, it is a place of peace.’ Too much peace, I suspect. ‘Sister Superior.’ Alcina turned, squaring her shoulders. Already understanding her second’s disapproving expression, Augusta only nodded. ‘I hear you, Sister, and you are not wrong. But we have a mission, and we must succeed in that mission. And there are times when that mission is not about a war.’ A flicker of a smile. ‘Though I confess, that unsettles me just as much as the atmosphere of this convent.’ The smile faded again. ‘By His grace and blessing, we have come through the storm. He landed us safely for a reason.’ Viola fidgeted, but said nothing. Akemi said, ‘Let me come with you, Sister. I can be quiet, and I may… I may be able to read the gravestones’ ancient symbols, where you cannot.’ Augusta gave the youngest Sister a long look, then nodded. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, we will stay in vox-contact. I will recite the opening words of the Treatise, every fifteen minutes, beginning at the hour of Evensong. If I do not…’ Her smile turned mirthless. ‘Then don your wargear, in His name, and seek answers of the canoness. If she gives none, then you head for the crash site and complete the mission.’ ‘I strongly advise against this, Sister,’ Alcina said, sternly disapproving. ‘We should head for that crash site now–’ ‘Objection noted,’ Augusta said. ‘Akemi?’ The youngest Sister, slight out of her armour but wrought from steel wire, inhaled like she was bracing herself. ‘Yes, Sister Superior. And may He bless our explorations.’ May He bless our explorations. The convent was quiet, its cloisters open to the storm and charged with the electricity in the air. The hairs on Augusta’s forearms were standing on end and her skin prickled with it, as if covered in crawlers. From the cathedral transept, there came a twining of Evensong voices – another eerie, minor-key harmony. Akemi walked silently, her small face creased in a frown. Skulls in the cloisters’ carved ceilings leered toothily as they passed. ‘What bothers you, Sister?’ Augusta’s voice was barely a whisper, sounding in Akemi’s vox-bead. ‘Forgive me, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘I am thinking. We, alone, of possibly hundreds of ships, have been able to land here, our pilot blessed by Him to bring us safely through the storm. Yet the canoness has said this world is isolated by His design. I cannot resolve these two things. Has He brought us here? Or are we unwelcome, in defiance of His wishes?’ ‘Have faith, Akemi,’ Augusta answered, her confidence complete. ‘The loss of the Aeris, and the text she bears – this was His way to guide us to this world, and to our lost Sisters. Whatever takes place, He has brought us here to see it.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Akemi said nothing more, and they kept walking. The cloisters were a large quadrangle, surrounding a flagstoned square with a great and many-layered fountain at its centre. Rainwater chuckled, overspilling the fountain’s edges. Side doors offered storage chambers: places where the attending frateris would care for the life of the cathedral, its kneeling mats, censers and hymn books. Another door led to the sacristy, where the Sisters’ grey robes could be stored. Carefully, Augusta pushed at it, but it was locked. From the transept, Evensong rose to its crescendo, shivering outwards across the storm. Lightning flashed, though not closely; the thunder was a distance away. Soon, they reached the cloisters’ outermost corner and paused. An arched and open doorway offered a short flight of stone steps and a gravel path that curved onwards through the building’s closest graveyard. The rain had thinned to a gentle, drifting mist, and upright lumens offered cold white pools of illumination. Thunder grumbled, distant now. Everything lurked ghostlike, fogged and monochrome. Waiting. Augusta began to wish she’d brought her armour, noisy though it was. It was so much a part of her, of her faith and capability, that she felt acutely vulnerable without it. ‘What are we looking for, Sister?’ Akemi asked her. ‘Answers,’ Augusta said. ‘There is more to this than a downed ship.’ Out across the pale light, there were shifting, grey-clad shapes, almost unseen – the frateris, tending the stones even at this late hour. In the mist, they looked like phantoms. ‘This way.’ Very conscious of her scarlet padding, Augusta moved along the side of the building, circling it carefully. Akemi followed, looking at the gravestones, some of them embedded in the wall. As they reached the back of the building, and began a slightly wider circle, Akemi stopped. ‘Sister,’ she said. Instantly, the Sister Superior froze. ‘What?’ ‘This stone’s been moved.’ ‘It is surely the stone of Sister Clara? ‘Not here, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Clara’s ashes will be interred in the Sisters’ own sarcophagus, the canoness did tell me that much. This…’ She sounded puzzled. ‘This is something else.’ ‘Explain.’ Drawing a breath, Akemi answered. ‘The canoness’ books are almost all in High Gothic. It’s a very old form, with some linguistic variations, but it’s essentially familiar. And it ties in with her claim that the frateris have retrieved them from the graves, in order to preserve them. But that…’ She nodded at the stone. It had three oddly shaped skulls engraved in its top, a prayer inscribed beneath. ‘That’s older. Much older. That stone is significantly older than the cathedral itself.’ Augusta shot the youngest Sister a sharp look. ‘So it’s been placed here since?’ Akemi nodded, her thoughts coalescing as she spoke. ‘It must have been brought here from somewhere else, laid into the wall when the cathedral was built. And that, in turn, would imply that something has been here–’ ‘For longer than the Sisters.’ Augusta considered this, nodding. ‘I–’ ‘Sister Superior.’ Startled, Augusta turned. She was unsettled indeed if anyone could come this close, unheard and undetected. Instinctively, her hand had gone for her bolter, but she drew it back – this was one of the frateris, a grey-cloaked figure, his hood back. His face was young and lean, and etched with shadows from the overhead lumens. ‘Yes?’ Arching an austere eyebrow, she offered no apology or explanation. ‘It is late, Sisters.’ The man’s tone was chillingly polite. ‘The canoness has asked us to ensure your welfare, and you should be resting before Nightfall prayers.’ His eyes were dark sockets, as skull-like as everything else in that place. ‘She will be expecting you.’ He leaned on the word, just enough. ‘And we will attend, of course,’ Augusta answered him, her authority smooth and unchallenged. ‘But perhaps, since you are here, you can answer a question.’ ‘Forgive me, Sister,’ the young man said, as smoothly polished as the canoness’ tabletop. ‘This is hardly the place for questions. You are guests of the convent. And you should be attending milady canoness.’ There was a warning in his tone, a blade sheathed but ready. And while his words were carefully chosen, his behaviour was verging on arrogant. ‘He’s hiding something,’ Akemi said, over the vox. ‘I agree,’ Augusta answered her. ‘But what?’ The Sister Superior returned to the chamber with few answers, only more questions. Remaining within, she and the squad observed the Nightfall prayer by themselves, offering their words to His sacred effigy that had come with them from Ophelia VII. The Sister Superior prayed for divine guidance – not the usual litany, but with words that came from her heart. The image from the cathedral window had stayed with her, as if flash-etched onto her retinae. She had distinct suspicions – graveyard world, older culture – such things were ­inevitable. But without tangible proof, she could hardly make accusations. Why was that headstone in the cathedral wall? Where had it come from? And why had she seen only younger faces? Aside from the old lady, every Sister, every servitor, every member of the frateris militia had been under thirty – significantly younger than Augusta herself. The thought came with smoke-curls of sinister possibilities, coiling like the life of Sister Clara. The Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. There was only one way to find an answer. In the morning, after the dawn prayer, the squad donned full armour and attended, as was proper, the canoness’ wishes. The old lady was as polite as ever, saying nothing about the previous evening’s excursion. Augusta wasn’t sure if that was simply due to decorum, or because she genuinely didn’t know. Had the frateris not told her? Such a lack of discipline and respect – that was unheard of. Just who was lying to whom? ‘With your permission, milady,’ she said. ‘We must seek the Aeris.’ Answering the canoness’ query about their mission, Augusta fully intended to get to the bottom of this. ‘I have her approximate coordinates and my mission directive is very clear. If the ship’s resting place is here, then He will guide us to its side.’ ‘Of course,’ the old lady said. ‘Victuals have been prepared for you. I do not believe the ship is here, but you must undertake your mission. Go, with His blessing.’ Her permission was confusing. Viola, much happier now her heavy bolter had been returned, commented darkly as they headed out, ‘Did she not deny that the ship was here? Then why grant us permission to seek its location? She says one thing and then she says another. We should confront her.’ ‘I agree,’ Alcina said. ‘I do not like this… sneaking.’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia disagreed. ‘Her words were sincere. She endeavours only to help, to facilitate our mission.’ She looked round at her Sisters, her red helm glistening with rain. ‘I do not doubt her faith.’ ‘This place is rotten,’ Viola muttered. ‘It stinks.’ Despite the filters in the Sisters’ armour, smells of death lingered, of bones and dust. The place seemed old, serenely quiet, its headstones pulled down by reaching creepers, its occasional dark trees all swarmed with ivy. Thunder still grumbled, but remained a distance away. Following Caia’s auspex, they wound their way through the endless criss-cross of sunken walkways. Akemi watched both sides, her head turning back and forth like a lighthouse; Melia carried the rations that the servitors had prepared for them. Alcina walked at the rear, still sternly disapproving of Augusta’s choices. But without proof, Augusta could say nothing. ‘There,’ Caia said. The green glare of the auspex shone out through thin, ever-clouded morning light. ‘Over the rise.’ Beneath the storm, the Aeris lay dead, her hard, angular shape silhouetted by the thunderous sky. She was an exploratory-class vessel, small compared to the frigates and destroyers of the Imperial Navy, and she lay broken on her side, half buried in blackened soil and shattered headstones. Her nose was completely covered, her adamantine plating charred by lightning and extreme heat; the Sisters could see the huge, miles-long burn-scar, crashing through walls and statues, that her death had ripped in the ground. ‘Hold.’ At Augusta’s order, the Sisters dropped at the lip of the ridge. They lay on their bellies, looking over at the downed ship. Caia’s auspex flickered green: movement. Only a dozen blips, but enough. ‘They cannot be crew?’ Melia said, puzzled. ‘It has taken us four months to reach this planet,’ Augusta answered. ‘Any survivors would already have been found by the convent.’ ‘Unless they chose to hide,’ Akemi suggested. Viola muttered, ‘Then why are they moving now?’ For a moment, the scent of Sister Clara’s burning coffin seemed to hang in the air. Dismissing whimsy, Augusta raised her magnoculars, and took a closer look. Immediately, she lowered them, blinking, and passed them to Sister Alcina. ‘Tell me what you see, Sister.’ Frowning, Alcina took her turn. ‘No survivors,’ she said. ‘The saviour pods were never even launched. I suspect the storm slew the ship’s machine-spirit and the Aeris never had a chance – she crashed powerless. It is unlikely the crew survived. And I see…’ She reared back, blinked exactly like Augusta had done, looked once again through the magnoculars. ‘By the Throne. Truly, Sister Superior, He has brought us here for a deeper purpose.’ ‘What?’ Viola, her shoulder against the heavy bolter, almost crackled with impatience. Augusta nodded. ‘We have our answers, Sisters,’ she said. ‘The frateris are stripping salvage from the ship. And my heart tells me this is not for the canoness’ use. ‘Move!’ The bark was soft; the Sisters skirmished, and fast. While the frateris were neither armed nor armoured, Augusta still held to her lingering suspicion that there was another power at work here. Something else, something older. Something that had built headstones, long before the founding of the cathedral. And something that, during the Imperium’s absence, had seeped slowly back to the surface. Something xenos. Three of the Sisters ran forwards, dropped behind graves and statues, then offered cover while the other three ran – the movements were instinctive, perfectly executed, smooth as gun oil. Caia, silent and on point, indicated with one arm and the squad bore left, passing the nose of the downed ship, and holding to the heavy, cold undershadow of its huge and looming belly. Carefully, slowing down now, they approached a shattered wall. And beneath it, a yawning, stone-lined void, black as betrayal, and half collapsed by the ship’s corpse. Voices became audible, echoing from burn-scarred metal. ‘Don’t drop it, you damned oaf. Take it to the entrance, put it on the pile.’ Grumbles and grunts followed. Whatever the cargo, it was heavy. Augusta half expected the whine of a loader, but there was nothing. ‘And you!’ The voice was familiar. ‘Stop dawdling!’ Akemi said, her voice a whisper, ‘That’s–’ ‘Last night’s challenger.’ The Sister Superior couldn’t muster surprise ‘Of course it is.’ She controlled a need to curse – suddenly, this was all fitting together. Over the vox, she said, ‘Viola, with me. The rest of you, stay and cover. Alcina, eyes and ears open. Caia, I want locations on everything moving. And find me that text!’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola and the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her shoulder, Augusta rose from her cover, and issued a flat command. ‘You.’ The word was a bark, aimed at the man who had spoken. ‘This is an Imperial vessel, under examination by the Adepta Sororitas. Put down your cargo, lie belly down on the floor.’ Figures turned, glanced at each other, wondered what was going on. ‘Now.’ No one moved. They stared at the red-armoured figures of the Sisters. Augusta said, ‘Three… two… one…’ As the countdown reached zero, she shot the closest figure, straight through the chest. The detonation was echoing-loud; scarlet exploded across ground and stone and the ship’s underside. Still, the figures did not move. Viola hefted the heavy bolter, waiting for the order. ‘Sister Superior,’ the man said, amused and exasperated. He was indeed the same figure that they’d seen the previous night, cadaverous and austere, despite his youth. ‘I told you – you should be at prayers, attending the canoness. I was intending to retrieve your relic for you. Before you… came looking.’ Despite the death of his fellow, he had a flat absence of either surprise or fear. And there was an implication to his phrase that she didn’t quite follow. Using her preysight, she scanned him for weapons, found none, but still, she did not dismiss the threat. His confidence was bothering her – what didn’t she know? She walked forwards, focused on the speaker. Viola walked with her, focused everywhere else. ‘Move away from the ship.’ ‘Please, Sister.’ The man spread his hands, smiling. ‘This is not your concern.’ Bolter in the other hand, Augusta grabbed him by a fistful of grey shirt, slammed his back against the blood-spattered corpse of the Aeris. ‘You are frateris militia, and you do not speak to me, or to any Sister, with such lack of respect. Your life belongs to Him, and to the convent. You are sworn to His service.’ She made an assumption, ran with it. ‘Why do you lie to your canoness?’ What are you hiding? The man narrowed his gaze, but still showed no fear. His glance flicked past her shoulder, and she became aware that the rest of the squad was moving, closing up the distance to the ship. From the corner of her eye, she saw Caia gesturing direction – they were looking for the text. She said, ‘You are a heretic–’ ‘Then kill me.’ His grin was confident, now verging on crazed. ‘I do not fear His blessing.’ His eyes shone. ‘But I do His work, Sister, as do we all. Should I rise to His glory, another will take my place, and another, and another. I offer their youth, their lives, to Him. And He rewards me – us – well!’ ‘You slew Sister Clara.’ It was a rush of horror, a cold hand of realisation. ‘You slay all of them.’ ‘I grant them His blessing.’ His rictus grin was suitably skull-like. ‘This is Letum, it has always been this way. They wish the Throne, and we grant them their release. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much.’ ‘What knowledge?’ The man laughed, the noise dark and rich. ‘It is our secret, forbidden, not to be shared. Not even with you.’ ‘Or with the convent.’ The horror was crawling over Augusta’s skin now, writhing like the strands of creeper. ‘You murder them, and they do not even know why.’ ‘Murder?’ His grin faltered; he seemed genuinely confused. ‘We bless them, Sister. There is a plant here, grown with His blessing. A little in the food, that’s all it takes – and a heart fails.’ His sincerity was startling. ‘This is Letum. And this is His word, His way, His calling, His grace–’ ‘He’s crazed.’ Viola was starting to twitch – her need to open fire was tangible. Augusta, too, could feel her horror fusing to fury, that welcome rise of red rage that was His touch, showing her the way. But not yet. There was a thread to the man’s glee that she had yet to understand. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much. ‘Caia.’ Over the vox. ‘Report.’ ‘The ship’s been stripped,’ Caia returned. ‘Panels, wires, metalwork, everything. It’s a skeleton, there’s almost nothing left. Whatever they’re doing, it’s been going on for months.’ ‘I hear you.’ Augusta jammed her bolter, hard, under the man’s throat. ‘Where are you taking it?’ ‘I told you, that knowledge is forbidden.’ The man’s grin grew wider, his eyes flared. ‘He has spoken to me, in visions. He has decreed my path!’ ‘You utter both falsehood and blasphemy.’ She was really angry now. ‘You are a betrayer, faithless, and you presume to take His name?’ ‘I utter no falsehood, Sister. I hold faith, always. He has spoken to me, to all of us. He has sent us visions, taught us how to obey His creed. We believe in Him, we have held to His faith for generations.’ There was an honest plea in his voice. Viola, her voice dark with blood, said, ‘All those ships, Sister, those missing merchants’ vessels. Whatever this is, it’s larger than just the Aeris.’ ‘I agree,’ Augusta said. Thinking for a minute, she gave the squad the order to regroup on her location. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We will secure these… cultists’ – she refused to give them their title – ‘and follow the trail of their ported cargo. Let us pray, my Sisters, that He will take us to the end of this puzzle.’ Sister Caia had not yet managed to locate the sacred text, but Augusta would return to the main task of her mission once this matter was resolved. A brief scout showed a side chamber in the stone maw, a place where more cargo was piled. Carrying His authority and with the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her back, the Sister Superior commanded the frateris to amass within, and left Sister Alcina as their guard. Augusta had no wish to seek a potential foe with reduced strength, but these faithless heretics would face the justice of their Order’s canoness, the one they had betrayed. And Alcina’s sheer presence was enough to ensure their behaviour. The remaining five of the squad ducked into the hole. Following the stamped-down trail of bootsteps, they headed deep, deep beneath the gravestones. Swiftly, they left the thin, stormy daylight behind them and vanished into swallowing black. They turned on their suit lights, angled beams of illumination that picked out multiple layers, like rock strata, compressed into the walls. But the stripes were not rock. Letum had been a cemetery planet for millennia, and only its uppermost graves were still on the surface. These left trailing roots, ends of bone, fragments of grave goods, pieces of coffins. As the Sisters moved deeper, still following the stamped hard-route and the occasional dropped corroded brass cog, they found coffins in layers, like geological ages – pieces of older headstones, fragments of dead technology. Slices of stone ran round the walls, and before much longer, these began to spread out through the soil, opening to a smooth throat that was bitterly, shiveringly cold. Sealed in her armour, Augusta checked her temperature read-out and gestured for the five of them to slow down. Caia, still on point and still using her auspex, shook her head: no motion. But the Sister Superior knew they were coming to the heart of this. And that too-smooth stone was chillingly familiar. Walk with us, O Emperor. Bear your light to guide our bootsteps… With a prayer over the vox, they crept forwards, suit lights slanting through the pitch-dark. Akemi paused at a series of symbols, too ancient to even bear mould, but Augusta already knew what they were. She had seen them before. And they confirmed her suspicions. What else would hide this deep beneath the gravestones, teaching its cult of death? She paused, though she could not read the lettering. ‘It seems the frateris have been weak,’ she said. ‘They have betrayed their faith, fallen victim to something that yet lurks down here.’ Her voice was bleak. ‘It calls to them. And they listen.’ Viola hefted the heavy bolter. ‘It’s not going to call for much longer.’ The Sister Superior did not permit herself a chuckle. They moved on, deeper and colder, careful with every step. And then: blip. Only the one, and stationary. Ahead of them. ‘Close up formation. Viola, on point. Melia, take the rear.’ Over the vox, Augusta started to sing the battle litany, heard her Sisters join her, their harmonies clean and strong. The words were not spoken aloud, not down here, but they were familiar, His presence carried with them even into the darkest depths of this xenos-polluted world. We will remove the taint, she thought. Free our Sisters from this heretic grip! And then, they reached the mouth of the tunnel. And saw light. The light was green, taint and unholiness, and it flooded from a vast and upright gemstone in the centre of the room. The stone had no support – it turned slowly, floating free of a symbol-carved floor, concentric circles that pulled all eyes towards its central, gelid might. The walls, too, were etched in cyphers, studded with skulls, many of them encrusted with gems in their turn. Each one glittered like the eyes of the skulls in the cathedral. Watching. But that was not what made the Sisters pause. About the vast stone, shadows moved, hundreds, thousands of them – every one a piece of scavenged technology. From the Aeris, from the dozens, even hundreds of ships that had hove too close to the storm, and then crashed here, they now orbited the stone’s light slowly, like some drifting, asteroid eclipse, some floating of fragmented night. ‘Viola.’ Augusta did not hesitate. The younger Sister aimed the heavy bolter. Caia said, ‘Wait!’ Another blip, and another, and another. Augusta drew her chainsword, though she did not start the mechanism. Descending from the huge dome of the roof came shapes. Not more skulls, but three elongated, oddly insectoid figures with metallic and curling tails, and a multitude of eager, gleaming claws. They glowed with the same green light, and Augusta’s suspicions were confirmed. Necrons. Of course. She had time for one shout: ‘Don’t let them close!’ And then the Sisters were moving as one, shoulder to shoulder, all of them facing outwards. Roaring the words of the battle prayer, Viola opened fire. The noise was deafening. A full suppression exploded across the room; rounds tore upwards, targeting the descending figures. One monster was caught and sent spinning, another was buffeted physically backwards by the force of the attack. Wounds erupted across its body, spraying dark splashes of oil. It crashed against the wall and fell, crumpled. It didn’t move again. ‘In His name!’ There was the ring of victory in Viola’s voice. But the other two were still moving, and there were more blips incoming. Even as the Sisters opened fire, the things flickered and shifted, and the rounds went straight through them, striking sparks and debris from the walls and roof. ‘What–’ Akemi cut off the curse and kept shooting. ‘They phase!’ Augusta remembered all too well the world of Heqet, and the last time she’d seen a necron wraith. ‘Time your shooting!’ Viola turned the heavy bolter on the second figure, but it had already faded away. ‘We’ve got more of them,’ Caia said. ‘Dominica’s eyes.’ The auspex was alive with motion. ‘Move!’ Augusta bellowed. ‘To the tunnel mouth. Melia, we need the flamer!’ They moved, Viola covering. The younger Sister checked back over her shoulder, fell back as Melia came to the fore. And just in time, as a stream of clicking silver came pouring down the walls, scuttling even over the gemstone itself. Augusta had seen necron scarabs reduce a human to nothing in less than a second, take entire squads to pieces, armour and all. But Melia stood firm, framed by the green light of the tunnel mouth, her armour flaring scarlet at its edges. Watching the seethe, she waited. Augusta held her breath, trusting to her Sister’s experience. Then, with a cry of prayer, Melia loosed the full force of the flamer. Scarabs screeched like tortured metal, shattered with superheat. They crisped and turned over, curling up their legs. Keeping the flamer spraying, she moved it back and forth over the room’s floor, then up the walls towards the ceiling. Thick smoke filled the air, stinking. The creatures sparked and crackled. Then, without warning, Melia fell. One of the wraiths had reappeared, its claws embedded in her armour. Even as Augusta moved to shoot it, it was gone again, leaving Melia crumpled on the floor. The last of the scarabs headed instantly for her, clicking as they came. Caia, howling a prayer of her own, moved forwards to stamp on them. The words of the battle litany came from her in sheer, boiling fury. Sister Melia did not move. Augusta, eyes everywhere, searched the main chamber. ‘If there are wraiths, she said. ‘There’s likely to be a spider.’ She grinned, though the others could not see it. ‘Let’s coax it out, shall we? Viola, hit the phylactery.’ Raising the heavy bolter, Sister Viola blew the gemstone away. In the librarium, the canoness looked at the Sisters. The squad were battered and filthy, their armour damaged by the claws of the wraiths, by the insistent scuttle of the devouring scarabs. Melia was walking, though carefully; Alcina eyed the five of them with the faintest air of irritation, as if she had wanted to be in at the fighting. But she had brought the faithless frateris back with her, and their leader now stood before his canoness, his head up, his eyes blazing. There was no repentance in him, only a savage and eager joy. The rest of them had been placed in the convent’s crypts. For now. ‘Xenos, you say.’ Elderly though the canoness was, her voice still carried an edge, the true, righteous wrath of a Sister of Battle. ‘And their pollution rife amongst my people.’ Her gaze turned to the man, but he met it fearlessly, welcomed it. ‘I have done nothing wrong,’ he said. ‘Only embraced Him! His greatest gift!’ Swift as a thought, the canoness backhanded him. ‘How dare you?’ Her voice was livid with outrage. ‘Your blasphemy! Your betrayal!’ She was physically shaking, quivering with the kind of anger that should blister the skin of his face. ‘The Sisters of this Order that you have manipulated to their deaths!’ With a thump, she brought one hand down on the table, making her effigies and candles jump. ‘You have made a mockery of our very faith.’ The man said, again, ‘I have done nothing wrong! The great gem – it needs energy. Needed ships, supplies, power! Needs to build its forces once more! And it was His voice, His voice!’ The man staggered suddenly to his knees, reached for the hem of the canoness’ grey robe. ‘He spoke to me, milady. He came to me in a vision. A vision of death, and of pure, green light!’ The canoness stared down at him, pitiless. ‘And every time a Sister grew too close, it told you to end her life,’ Augusta said, her tone pure steel. ‘To make of her a sacrifice.’ ‘He spoke to me.’ The man, pleading now, looked from canoness to Sister Superior. ‘He wanted only to help them. He spoke to my father, to my mother, to their parents before them. He–’ ‘Enough.’ The canoness snatched her robe from the man’s grasp, swept it back to herself with a gesture that was all imperious scorn. ‘You have allied yourselves with a xenos power,’ Augusta said, grimly. ‘Caused the deaths of unknown numbers of His faithful. Your life is forfeit–’ ‘Wait,’ the canoness said. ‘Milady?’ ‘I have already said.’ The old lady sounded sad, now, her long years weighing heavy, but her eyes were like chips of flint. ‘We are not warriors, not like yourselves. We do His work, tending to those who have gone before us. But that work is not the work of warfare, it is the work of peace. Of His peace. Of that final peace that is granted in death, and in repose.’ She was staring at the frateris, who had a slow, horrific realisation breaking across his face. ‘I will not grant you that peace, heretic.’ Around Augusta, the squad shifted, understanding. ‘No…’ said the man. Abruptly, the canoness lost her temper. ‘You have made a lie of our very Order! You have taken the tenets of this convent, of its most holy teachings, and you have twisted them, offering them to a xenos power! You have betrayed everything that He means to us, to this world of the sacred dead!’ Now the man was cowering, sobs starting in his chest. His love for the old lady was honest; the shattering of his own lies almost too much to bear. He said, ‘But I had a vision… I was only bringing His blessing…’ ‘Your vision was falsehood,’ Augusta told him, still hard as rock. ‘You are no longer frateris. You are nothing.’ ‘You are nothing,’ the canoness agreed. ‘You will join your fellows in the crypt. And there you will stay. Until your shouts weaken, and your hunger and thirst grow unbearable. Until you find repentance in your heart. And I pray that when you do face Him, you will know your faithlessness and understand humility. In that way, your soul may yet be saved.’ Alcina was nodding, sternly approving. Melia had frowned, but said nothing. ‘And you, milady?’ Augusta asked. ‘What will you do, without your frateris?’ ‘Penance, Sister Superior,’ the canoness responded. ‘We allowed our faith to falter, to be corrupted by this ancient, xenos taint, and we did nothing. We allowed our young Sisters to be tricked to their deaths, and we did nothing. We only celebrated their ascension, knowing not what had caused it. We will offer our own labours in repentance. We will leave this closeted building, as we should have done long ago, and we will tend to the graves ourselves.’ She stopped, thinking for a minute, then finished, ‘I understand you have not yet found your text?’ Comprehending more than the question, Augusta responded, ‘No, milady, we have not. And it would be our honour to stay, even after our mission is completed.’ She looked round at the rest of the squad. ‘This world may yet have foes lurking beneath its surface. They must be sought out, and summarily slain.’ With the faintest flicker of a smile, the canoness nodded. ‘Then perhaps,’ she said, ‘we do have need for warriors, after all.’",

      "content": "Lightning tore through the sky. Seen through the cathedral’s massive glassaic window, it was a pure and holy wrath, flashing His image to brilliance. ‘O most Holy Emperor, grant to our Sister eternal rest!’ Beneath Him, at the altar, the slight, grey-robed form of the canoness raised her arms to His glory, her voice in the sacred requiem. Rolls of thunder joined her words, rumbling at the building’s walls, beating down upon its high and vaulted roof. ‘Let the light of your Throne shine upon her!’ Below the elderly figure, her congregation were mesmerised. In the foremost pew, helm off and head bowed as was proper, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus suppressed a shiver at His manifest might. His storm reigned perpetual, here on this tiny, forgotten world. ‘Hear my prayer, O Emperor. To you, all lives are owed! To you, all flesh must come!’ The requiem was unaccompanied – no organ, no music. Its harmonies were dense but unfamiliar, twisting through the acoustics in an eerie, minor key. Sister Akemi, to Augusta’s left side, shifted, shot a glance along the pew at Sister Melia. The storm grumbled on, like the anger in grief. Behind Augusta’s squad, the Sisters of the canoness’ Order and their frateris militia raised their own voices, responding to the litany. ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ The service was a funeral. Despatched by the Ecclesiarchy and newly arrived upon Letum, Augusta had not known the young Sister who had passed to His grace. She’d had no time to speak to the canoness personally; instead, she had respectfully agreed to attend the service. But this… The image in the great Sol-facing window was not Him in His full glory, armoured and bearing His bright and flaming sword – it was Him as He would be, ancient and enthroned in cables. Before it, four ancient servo-skulls hovered like guardians, their metal corroded, but their green eyes sharp as gemstones. She could not shake the feeling that they watched her, analysing what they saw. Carefully, she honoured the hymn, though the responses were unknown. ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ The lightning flashed again, causing His image to blaze, for a split second, out across the nave, almost like He had been there in person. Chilled to the absolute bone by the undisciplined thought, Augusta offered a penitent prayer. Such was arrogance, and unforgiveable. This place was unsettling, true, but that was not a justification. Sister Viola, always the hothead, cursed under her breath. Alcina, the squad’s second-in-command, snapped the ghost of an order and Viola subsided. But Augusta’s odd, visceral shudder did not. Tiny and isolated, cut off by His never-ceasing storm, the Sisters of this convent were completely unknown. They wore no armour, their robes and cloaks were a beautifully embroidered grey, and rather than a fleur-de-lys, their faces were tattooed with the outline of a skull. They called themselves the Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. Letum was a cemetery planet, a world of gravestones and towering, carved sarcophagi. In millennia past, it had been a resting place for the Imperium’s most honoured dead, and a silent, stone civilisation had grown out around its endless corpses – spreading grids of sunken walkways, shrines and chapels like ossuaries, all studded with bones, locked reliquaries where only He still remembered their contents. Once, pilgrims had come here, to study the headstones or to tend to them – but no pilgrim had touched this world in centuries. Not since the coming of the storm and its restless, magnetic field. Any ship attempting to land here would be brought down by His lightning. The Imperium’s bureaucracy had known this, but Letum had little intrinsic value – no wealth or resources. Lost somewhere between endless scriveners, and now both unreachable and unimportant, it had been abandoned, and left to its veneration of death. Augusta stole a look upward, her head still bowed, her bobbed hair falling grey past her ears. Atop the altar, as grey as everything else, lay an open coffin; within it, the young Sister who had passed. The coffin was steel, beautifully wrought and etched in skulls; at either end, a conducting rod connected it to the cathedral’s outside wall. The thunder growled low, like anticipation. With the sound, the congregation’s expectancy rose. The canoness still prayed, her arms aloft, her words a torch, a hymn, a tocsin. ‘He comes!’ she said, her tone livid with passion. ‘Let us witness the touch of His light!’ Perhaps the flash of His image had been less arrogance, Augusta thought, and more a deliberate illustration of this convent’s empathic belief. But still, her shudder did not fade. She should have more discipline. Praying, she focused her thoughts. The canoness’ voice rose further. She had her congregation gripped, the three pews of her Sisters, the frateris further back. Her head tilted back, strands of her white hair floating upwards round her face, she was entreating His storm for its touch, calling it to her. And, much as Augusta tried to banish the unworthy thought, the storm seemed to be listening. The flashes, vivid and shocking, were coming closer; the gap between the light and the sound narrowed with every strike. Even as the Sister Superior stole another look, a crashing rumble of thunder sounded directly overhead. There was the sudden hiss of rain against the glassaic. The canoness cried, ‘Bring mercy! Release our Sister to your storm!’ Propelled, the congregation were on their feet. They returned her words, but their cries were staccato, now, scattered throughout the nave and rapidly becoming louder. Frenzy rang from them like the clashing of cymbals. ‘Release!’ ‘Have mercy!’ ‘He comes!’ Uneasy, Sister Viola flashed a look over her shoulder. As Augusta glanced sideways, she crossed gazes with the younger Sister’s bright green eyes, saw flickers of both concern and non-comprehension. Briefly, Viola raised an eyebrow, but Augusta only frowned, indicating that she should attend to her prayers. The canoness cried again, ‘He comes!’ ‘He comes!’ ‘Praise His lightning!’ ‘Praise it!’ Another flash. Another bellow, loud enough to shake the bell towers. Augusta prayed, then found herself catching her breath… For here, even as His image flashed down upon the altar itself, bright yellow crackled along the conducting rods, a spark like pure, bared adrenaline. The congregation cried aloud, one long, ‘Ah!’ And light detonated from the metal coffin. It was blinding, but the Sister Superior held her place, blinking the after-flash from her vision. His touch was gone. Instead, flames were crackling, warm and soft, from the coffin’s contents. There was the faint smell of burning wood and flesh; grey smoke curled, thick and greasy. Extractors hummed, though she could not see them. The still-hovering skulls glittered in new firelight. They grinned, wide and toothy, as though they had seen this a thousand times, yet had never tired of it. As though they knew secrets they would never tell. ‘By the Throne…’ Shaken, Viola swore again, her words a whisper. This time, neither Alcina nor Augusta corrected her. Whatever this funeral service was, the squad had never seen its like. The storm crashed in violent farewell, then, slowly, began to rumble away. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ voice was calm with authority, soft with age. Sitting by a polished table of real wood, its surface reflecting electro-candles and the red light of the hearth, she was a tiny figure, creased with the weight of years. ‘Milady,’ Augusta answered respectfully. ‘Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, Order of the Bloody Rose.’ She offered the sign of the aquila. ‘Ave Imperator.’ Following the recessional, the canoness had bade them follow in her footsteps. The walk through the bone-walled cloisters had been as unnerving as everything else, but the librarium was warm and the storm kept at bay by the thickness of both walls and curtains. ‘Indeed,’ the canoness said. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior. His blessing upon you, and upon your squad. You will forgive me, I hope, for insisting that you attend our service? Sister Clara was very dear to me, as novice and as tender both, and while I know she kneels now at the foot of the Great Throne, I confess that I shall miss her.’ She smiled, the expression gentle. ‘His ways are strange, are they not?’ At Augusta’s left shoulder, Alcina answered, ‘It is not our place to question them, milady.’ ‘Of course, of course.’ Without losing her smile, the canoness gestured for the Sister to subside. ‘Yet I find that age has brought a… certain restlessness to my soul. It is unusual for anyone, upon our world so tiny, to live to the years that I have done. And I find myself lonely, eagerly awaiting my turn for His greatest blessing.’ To Augusta’s other side, Melia and Caia, one as dusky as the other was blonde, exchanged a glance. They were close as blood-kin, had come up through the schola together – the nearness of the canoness to her friend would touch them deeply. Sister Viola, here bereft of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter, creaked as she shifted on her toes; the last and youngest member of the squad, Sister Akemi, was gazing raptly round at the bookshelves, lured by the promise of previously unseen lore. But Augusta was focused on the canoness. ‘Milady, it was our honour to attend your service, though its litanies were unfamiliar. You will forgive our lack of knowledge in not responding – no insult was intended.’ ‘And none was taken, Sister Superior.’ The canoness gestured at her servitors, which were laying tiny, perfect plates upon the table, each one offering some sort of fungus-based pastries. With a quiet bow, the grey-hooded figures withdrew. ‘Now, you must tell me of your Order – I have seen such armour only in my books, and yet here it is, the colour of new blood. And you must tell me why He has brought you here, Sister, to my little convent, so long untouched by the Imperium’s… warriors.’ There was an odd stress on the word ‘warriors’, but this was an uncharted corner of the void in more ways than one. Navigating carefully, Augusta offered no correction of the term. Instead, she said, ‘We seek a ship, milady, crash-landed upon your world. It bears a sacred text that I am charged to retrieve.’ ‘A ship?’ The elderly lady put her head to one side, almost birdlike in fine-boned fragility. Her white hair, neatly bunned but loose tendrils still crackling with remembered electricity, gleamed in the hearth-light, and her skull outline seemed oddly prominent, for all its age. ‘Sister Superior, no ships come to this world, crashed or otherwise. He has decreed our isolation, and we are gladly alone, caretakers of this, His most holy cemetery.’ Lines round her eyes crinkled with affection or wariness. ‘Truly, we are the servants of His last and greatest blessing.’ Viola opened her mouth, realised the answer, shut it again. But the canoness’ perception was sharp. ‘Our release, my fire-haired Sister. Our blessed ascension to the Great Throne, where we may at last witness His suspension and His glory. Truly, there is no greater gift.’ Her words glittered, dark and ardent. ‘He is the ultimate expression of the faith of my Order. The visage of death.’ At the word, thunder grumbled, and the canoness turned away to gaze upon the storm. Alcina shifted, but Augusta flicked a hand, discreetly and by her hip. Over the tight-beam vox-link, she subvocalised, ‘We must tread carefully, Sister. This place unsettles me, and I do not know why.’ ‘I hear you.’ Alcina’s response was laden with tension. Akemi was still staring at the books, her head turning sideways to read their spines. ‘You are a scholar?’ The canoness addressed the youngest Sister, making her start and turn back. ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Mmm.’ The old woman studied Akemi’s shining black hair, her pale skin, the relative newness of her fleur-de-lys tattoo. Like the skulls, she seemed to be analysing what she saw. ‘There is much lore here,’ she said. ‘It has been gathered from many places upon this world. Like my Sisters of this Order, our frateris militia have little use for combat. In place of such training, they tend to the headstones and shrines, as is proper, while we perform His ancient rites here, in the Great Cathedral. Sometimes, they bring to us things for which we must care – books, particularly, are vulnerable to the storm.’ There was something in her tone, an edge, the faintest hint of some deep curiosity. Akemi responded, her voice respectfully even. ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness chuckled. ‘You are perfectly behaved, young one.’ She tapped thin, claw-like fingers against her cheek. ‘So, little scholar, you shall stay. You shall bless me with your lore and tell me of your Order. Explain to me your flower symbol. It is a rose, is it not?’ Akemi shot a glance at Augusta. ‘Surely, milady, the Sister Superior…?’ Again, the elderly canoness waved her hand. ‘I have already said’ – the phrase was faintly sharp, a warning of discipline – ‘that combat is of little use here. A chamber awaits you, Sister Superior, and a quiet supper will be served in the refectorium. You are welcome to join us, of course. You – Akemi, isn’t it? – you will stay.’ Brooking no argument, she turned back to the bookshelf, as if searching for something she wished to show Akemi. ‘Sister Superior?’ Akemi’s subvocalised voice came over the squad-vox, wary and requesting permission. Augusta repeated the warning she had given Alcina, then said, ‘She is canoness of her Order and we do not disobey. But speak little, Akemi, and listen to every word she offers. Ask questions, if you are permitted.’ Privately, she thanked His wisdom that the canoness had selected Akemi and not Viola. ‘We must locate our missing text. And this place perturbs me, for reasons I cannot yet fathom.’ The refectorium was a small and circular chamber, figures of saints standing about its edges, and every one with its face pared down to a skull. Some were familiar – Celestine herself was here – but there were others that Augusta did not know, perhaps representations from headstones that the frateris had found or tended. Viola fidgeted; Melia, too, seemed oddly unsettled and, after partaking of a quiet meal, the Sisters returned to their sleeping chamber still restless, their hunger satisfied but not their unease. Once their door was closed, Viola exploded with withheld tension. ‘That was no grace that I have ever heard! We offer Him thanks for our victuals, not repentance that we must live another–’ ‘Silence.’ Augusta’s response was soft, but brooked no argument. Over their private channel, she said, ‘Caia, I want a complete technical sweep of this chamber and its surrounding area, as far as your auspex can reach. And I want to know where we are in relation to the estimated crash site. Between ourselves, we will communicate only over the vox.’ ‘Very wise.’ Alcina’s tone was all warning. ‘There is much here that defies my comprehension. While each Order bears its own prayers and hymns, these Sisters behave in a way that is… unusual.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘We will await Akemi, and any insight she brings,’ Augusta said. ‘But yes, I agree. There is something deeply amiss about this place. His voice speaks in my heart, and I must listen to His warnings.’ ‘The canoness told us the Soul of Aeris didn’t crash,’ Viola agreed. ‘We know that the ship’s last communication was of the storm. And they won’t let me carry my weapon.’ The words had an edge, the source of her restlessness. ‘Not only that,’ Melia said, her tone dark. ‘But the young Sister who perished – she was barely in her twenties, and in full health. I consider it unlikely that she perished from cardiac failure, as we have been told…’ Melia was trained by the Order of Serenity, and the squad’s medicae. She gave a twitch of a shrug, and her pauldron clattered. ‘The canoness seems learned, she must know this. Which would mean that she has uttered an open falsehood, before Him, in a sermon of holy worship. This is more than “unusual”, Sisters.’ There was a twist of horror to her words. ‘This is unthinkable.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘The crash site is approximately seven miles south-south-east of here.’ Caia lowered her auspex, its green wash of light fading. ‘With the density of the storm it is plausible that the descent of the ship went unnoticed. I can tell little more from here.’ ‘And are we being observed?’ ‘Not by machine-spirits.’ ‘There are ways, and ways.’ The comment was a thought, voiced over the vox. Aloud, the Sister Superior said, ‘Come, sing with me, my Sisters. Let us celebrate our finding of this Order, so newly joined to the Adepta Sororitas. We will raise our voices in His glory, and sing our requiem for Sister Clara. Sister Alcina, if you would.’ Alcina’s voice was a deep, full contralto; it rolled almost like the storm. It also allowed Augusta to listen. Not with the vox, but with her ears. And, as the other Sisters joined the hymnal, their harmonies as clean as the cathedral’s service had been eerie, she knew. She had heard these acoustics before. The convent may not have the technology to overhear, but every word the Sisters said was echoing back through the old, stone passages, and – she would have to assume – directly to the ears of the canoness. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said, when she returned. Like the others, she kept her words over the vox. ‘I was able to glean little. I told her of the younger Orders, of Deacis VI and of the Bloody and the Sacred Rose. Of our most holy saints Mina and Arabella. But she offered little in return. She did repeat, however, that she does not believe that the Aeris crashed here. Until our arrival, they had not seen a single Imperial vessel, of any size or description, in possibly millennia.’ ‘Millennia.’ Her armour off, laid out upon its sacred mat, Augusta knelt in her under-armour, the rose-red gambeson that helped to absorb incoming blows. The squad’s briefing had been very specific – they were to find the fallen ship, and the text that it had carried. And it was not just the Aeris. As the Sisters had crossed the vast steams of the empyrean, approaching this tiny corner of space, so Augusta had taken breaks from her squad’s training to learn as much as she could about Letum and its ceaseless storm. ‘We know,’ she said, ‘that the Aeris is not the only lost ship. Merchants’ vessels have gone missing near here, though nothing large or significant. Individually, they are unnoticeable, tiny cogs in a huge machine. But, if you put enough cogs together…’ She stopped, thinking. What she was about to suggest was, at best, a lack of protocol, at worst, downright blasphemous, but His calling in her heart was strong. As strong as it had been on Lycheate, with the doomed, crazed Inquisitor Istrix – she knew that something was wrong. In her mind, she saw the image-flash of the cathedral window, the lightning casting His image upon the stone. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, I am going to do something… unwise.’ Alcina raised a faintly acerbic eyebrow, but said nothing. ‘I will do this alone, take full responsibility for my actions. If questioned, you were following my orders.’ ‘You’re not going out there,’ Caia said, ever-perceptive. ‘The force of the storm–’ ‘That is not your decision to make, Sister,’ she answered, with a warning eyebrow. ‘I will not take my armour, it will make far too much noise. I will take my bolter, however, though only as a precaution. The canoness was right about one thing – there is no need for combat. Whatever else this place may be, it is a place of peace.’ Too much peace, I suspect. ‘Sister Superior.’ Alcina turned, squaring her shoulders. Already understanding her second’s disapproving expression, Augusta only nodded. ‘I hear you, Sister, and you are not wrong. But we have a mission, and we must succeed in that mission. And there are times when that mission is not about a war.’ A flicker of a smile. ‘Though I confess, that unsettles me just as much as the atmosphere of this convent.’ The smile faded again. ‘By His grace and blessing, we have come through the storm. He landed us safely for a reason.’ Viola fidgeted, but said nothing. Akemi said, ‘Let me come with you, Sister. I can be quiet, and I may… I may be able to read the gravestones’ ancient symbols, where you cannot.’ Augusta gave the youngest Sister a long look, then nodded. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, we will stay in vox-contact. I will recite the opening words of the Treatise, every fifteen minutes, beginning at the hour of Evensong. If I do not…’ Her smile turned mirthless. ‘Then don your wargear, in His name, and seek answers of the canoness. If she gives none, then you head for the crash site and complete the mission.’ ‘I strongly advise against this, Sister,’ Alcina said, sternly disapproving. ‘We should head for that crash site now–’ ‘Objection noted,’ Augusta said. ‘Akemi?’ The youngest Sister, slight out of her armour but wrought from steel wire, inhaled like she was bracing herself. ‘Yes, Sister Superior. And may He bless our explorations.’ May He bless our explorations. The convent was quiet, its cloisters open to the storm and charged with the electricity in the air. The hairs on Augusta’s forearms were standing on end and her skin prickled with it, as if covered in crawlers. From the cathedral transept, there came a twining of Evensong voices – another eerie, minor-key harmony. Akemi walked silently, her small face creased in a frown. Skulls in the cloisters’ carved ceilings leered toothily as they passed. ‘What bothers you, Sister?’ Augusta’s voice was barely a whisper, sounding in Akemi’s vox-bead. ‘Forgive me, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘I am thinking. We, alone, of possibly hundreds of ships, have been able to land here, our pilot blessed by Him to bring us safely through the storm. Yet the canoness has said this world is isolated by His design. I cannot resolve these two things. Has He brought us here? Or are we unwelcome, in defiance of His wishes?’ ‘Have faith, Akemi,’ Augusta answered, her confidence complete. ‘The loss of the Aeris, and the text she bears – this was His way to guide us to this world, and to our lost Sisters. Whatever takes place, He has brought us here to see it.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Akemi said nothing more, and they kept walking. The cloisters were a large quadrangle, surrounding a flagstoned square with a great and many-layered fountain at its centre. Rainwater chuckled, overspilling the fountain’s edges. Side doors offered storage chambers: places where the attending frateris would care for the life of the cathedral, its kneeling mats, censers and hymn books. Another door led to the sacristy, where the Sisters’ grey robes could be stored. Carefully, Augusta pushed at it, but it was locked. From the transept, Evensong rose to its crescendo, shivering outwards across the storm. Lightning flashed, though not closely; the thunder was a distance away. Soon, they reached the cloisters’ outermost corner and paused. An arched and open doorway offered a short flight of stone steps and a gravel path that curved onwards through the building’s closest graveyard. The rain had thinned to a gentle, drifting mist, and upright lumens offered cold white pools of illumination. Thunder grumbled, distant now. Everything lurked ghostlike, fogged and monochrome. Waiting. Augusta began to wish she’d brought her armour, noisy though it was. It was so much a part of her, of her faith and capability, that she felt acutely vulnerable without it. ‘What are we looking for, Sister?’ Akemi asked her. ‘Answers,’ Augusta said. ‘There is more to this than a downed ship.’ Out across the pale light, there were shifting, grey-clad shapes, almost unseen – the frateris, tending the stones even at this late hour. In the mist, they looked like phantoms. ‘This way.’ Very conscious of her scarlet padding, Augusta moved along the side of the building, circling it carefully. Akemi followed, looking at the gravestones, some of them embedded in the wall. As they reached the back of the building, and began a slightly wider circle, Akemi stopped. ‘Sister,’ she said. Instantly, the Sister Superior froze. ‘What?’ ‘This stone’s been moved.’ ‘It is surely the stone of Sister Clara? ‘Not here, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Clara’s ashes will be interred in the Sisters’ own sarcophagus, the canoness did tell me that much. This…’ She sounded puzzled. ‘This is something else.’ ‘Explain.’ Drawing a breath, Akemi answered. ‘The canoness’ books are almost all in High Gothic. It’s a very old form, with some linguistic variations, but it’s essentially familiar. And it ties in with her claim that the frateris have retrieved them from the graves, in order to preserve them. But that…’ She nodded at the stone. It had three oddly shaped skulls engraved in its top, a prayer inscribed beneath. ‘That’s older. Much older. That stone is significantly older than the cathedral itself.’ Augusta shot the youngest Sister a sharp look. ‘So it’s been placed here since?’ Akemi nodded, her thoughts coalescing as she spoke. ‘It must have been brought here from somewhere else, laid into the wall when the cathedral was built. And that, in turn, would imply that something has been here–’ ‘For longer than the Sisters.’ Augusta considered this, nodding. ‘I–’ ‘Sister Superior.’ Startled, Augusta turned. She was unsettled indeed if anyone could come this close, unheard and undetected. Instinctively, her hand had gone for her bolter, but she drew it back – this was one of the frateris, a grey-cloaked figure, his hood back. His face was young and lean, and etched with shadows from the overhead lumens. ‘Yes?’ Arching an austere eyebrow, she offered no apology or explanation. ‘It is late, Sisters.’ The man’s tone was chillingly polite. ‘The canoness has asked us to ensure your welfare, and you should be resting before Nightfall prayers.’ His eyes were dark sockets, as skull-like as everything else in that place. ‘She will be expecting you.’ He leaned on the word, just enough. ‘And we will attend, of course,’ Augusta answered him, her authority smooth and unchallenged. ‘But perhaps, since you are here, you can answer a question.’ ‘Forgive me, Sister,’ the young man said, as smoothly polished as the canoness’ tabletop. ‘This is hardly the place for questions. You are guests of the convent. And you should be attending milady canoness.’ There was a warning in his tone, a blade sheathed but ready. And while his words were carefully chosen, his behaviour was verging on arrogant. ‘He’s hiding something,’ Akemi said, over the vox. ‘I agree,’ Augusta answered her. ‘But what?’ The Sister Superior returned to the chamber with few answers, only more questions. Remaining within, she and the squad observed the Nightfall prayer by themselves, offering their words to His sacred effigy that had come with them from Ophelia VII. The Sister Superior prayed for divine guidance – not the usual litany, but with words that came from her heart. The image from the cathedral window had stayed with her, as if flash-etched onto her retinae. She had distinct suspicions – graveyard world, older culture – such things were ­inevitable. But without tangible proof, she could hardly make accusations. Why was that headstone in the cathedral wall? Where had it come from? And why had she seen only younger faces? Aside from the old lady, every Sister, every servitor, every member of the frateris militia had been under thirty – significantly younger than Augusta herself. The thought came with smoke-curls of sinister possibilities, coiling like the life of Sister Clara. The Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. There was only one way to find an answer. In the morning, after the dawn prayer, the squad donned full armour and attended, as was proper, the canoness’ wishes. The old lady was as polite as ever, saying nothing about the previous evening’s excursion. Augusta wasn’t sure if that was simply due to decorum, or because she genuinely didn’t know. Had the frateris not told her? Such a lack of discipline and respect – that was unheard of. Just who was lying to whom? ‘With your permission, milady,’ she said. ‘We must seek the Aeris.’ Answering the canoness’ query about their mission, Augusta fully intended to get to the bottom of this. ‘I have her approximate coordinates and my mission directive is very clear. If the ship’s resting place is here, then He will guide us to its side.’ ‘Of course,’ the old lady said. ‘Victuals have been prepared for you. I do not believe the ship is here, but you must undertake your mission. Go, with His blessing.’ Her permission was confusing. Viola, much happier now her heavy bolter had been returned, commented darkly as they headed out, ‘Did she not deny that the ship was here? Then why grant us permission to seek its location? She says one thing and then she says another. We should confront her.’ ‘I agree,’ Alcina said. ‘I do not like this… sneaking.’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia disagreed. ‘Her words were sincere. She endeavours only to help, to facilitate our mission.’ She looked round at her Sisters, her red helm glistening with rain. ‘I do not doubt her faith.’ ‘This place is rotten,’ Viola muttered. ‘It stinks.’ Despite the filters in the Sisters’ armour, smells of death lingered, of bones and dust. The place seemed old, serenely quiet, its headstones pulled down by reaching creepers, its occasional dark trees all swarmed with ivy. Thunder still grumbled, but remained a distance away. Following Caia’s auspex, they wound their way through the endless criss-cross of sunken walkways. Akemi watched both sides, her head turning back and forth like a lighthouse; Melia carried the rations that the servitors had prepared for them. Alcina walked at the rear, still sternly disapproving of Augusta’s choices. But without proof, Augusta could say nothing. ‘There,’ Caia said. The green glare of the auspex shone out through thin, ever-clouded morning light. ‘Over the rise.’ Beneath the storm, the Aeris lay dead, her hard, angular shape silhouetted by the thunderous sky. She was an exploratory-class vessel, small compared to the frigates and destroyers of the Imperial Navy, and she lay broken on her side, half buried in blackened soil and shattered headstones. Her nose was completely covered, her adamantine plating charred by lightning and extreme heat; the Sisters could see the huge, miles-long burn-scar, crashing through walls and statues, that her death had ripped in the ground. ‘Hold.’ At Augusta’s order, the Sisters dropped at the lip of the ridge. They lay on their bellies, looking over at the downed ship. Caia’s auspex flickered green: movement. Only a dozen blips, but enough. ‘They cannot be crew?’ Melia said, puzzled. ‘It has taken us four months to reach this planet,’ Augusta answered. ‘Any survivors would already have been found by the convent.’ ‘Unless they chose to hide,’ Akemi suggested. Viola muttered, ‘Then why are they moving now?’ For a moment, the scent of Sister Clara’s burning coffin seemed to hang in the air. Dismissing whimsy, Augusta raised her magnoculars, and took a closer look. Immediately, she lowered them, blinking, and passed them to Sister Alcina. ‘Tell me what you see, Sister.’ Frowning, Alcina took her turn. ‘No survivors,’ she said. ‘The saviour pods were never even launched. I suspect the storm slew the ship’s machine-spirit and the Aeris never had a chance – she crashed powerless. It is unlikely the crew survived. And I see…’ She reared back, blinked exactly like Augusta had done, looked once again through the magnoculars. ‘By the Throne. Truly, Sister Superior, He has brought us here for a deeper purpose.’ ‘What?’ Viola, her shoulder against the heavy bolter, almost crackled with impatience. Augusta nodded. ‘We have our answers, Sisters,’ she said. ‘The frateris are stripping salvage from the ship. And my heart tells me this is not for the canoness’ use. ‘Move!’ The bark was soft; the Sisters skirmished, and fast. While the frateris were neither armed nor armoured, Augusta still held to her lingering suspicion that there was another power at work here. Something else, something older. Something that had built headstones, long before the founding of the cathedral. And something that, during the Imperium’s absence, had seeped slowly back to the surface. Something xenos. Three of the Sisters ran forwards, dropped behind graves and statues, then offered cover while the other three ran – the movements were instinctive, perfectly executed, smooth as gun oil. Caia, silent and on point, indicated with one arm and the squad bore left, passing the nose of the downed ship, and holding to the heavy, cold undershadow of its huge and looming belly. Carefully, slowing down now, they approached a shattered wall. And beneath it, a yawning, stone-lined void, black as betrayal, and half collapsed by the ship’s corpse. Voices became audible, echoing from burn-scarred metal. ‘Don’t drop it, you damned oaf. Take it to the entrance, put it on the pile.’ Grumbles and grunts followed. Whatever the cargo, it was heavy. Augusta half expected the whine of a loader, but there was nothing. ‘And you!’ The voice was familiar. ‘Stop dawdling!’ Akemi said, her voice a whisper, ‘That’s–’ ‘Last night’s challenger.’ The Sister Superior couldn’t muster surprise ‘Of course it is.’ She controlled a need to curse – suddenly, this was all fitting together. Over the vox, she said, ‘Viola, with me. The rest of you, stay and cover. Alcina, eyes and ears open. Caia, I want locations on everything moving. And find me that text!’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola and the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her shoulder, Augusta rose from her cover, and issued a flat command. ‘You.’ The word was a bark, aimed at the man who had spoken. ‘This is an Imperial vessel, under examination by the Adepta Sororitas. Put down your cargo, lie belly down on the floor.’ Figures turned, glanced at each other, wondered what was going on. ‘Now.’ No one moved. They stared at the red-armoured figures of the Sisters. Augusta said, ‘Three… two… one…’ As the countdown reached zero, she shot the closest figure, straight through the chest. The detonation was echoing-loud; scarlet exploded across ground and stone and the ship’s underside. Still, the figures did not move. Viola hefted the heavy bolter, waiting for the order. ‘Sister Superior,’ the man said, amused and exasperated. He was indeed the same figure that they’d seen the previous night, cadaverous and austere, despite his youth. ‘I told you – you should be at prayers, attending the canoness. I was intending to retrieve your relic for you. Before you… came looking.’ Despite the death of his fellow, he had a flat absence of either surprise or fear. And there was an implication to his phrase that she didn’t quite follow. Using her preysight, she scanned him for weapons, found none, but still, she did not dismiss the threat. His confidence was bothering her – what didn’t she know? She walked forwards, focused on the speaker. Viola walked with her, focused everywhere else. ‘Move away from the ship.’ ‘Please, Sister.’ The man spread his hands, smiling. ‘This is not your concern.’ Bolter in the other hand, Augusta grabbed him by a fistful of grey shirt, slammed his back against the blood-spattered corpse of the Aeris. ‘You are frateris militia, and you do not speak to me, or to any Sister, with such lack of respect. Your life belongs to Him, and to the convent. You are sworn to His service.’ She made an assumption, ran with it. ‘Why do you lie to your canoness?’ What are you hiding? The man narrowed his gaze, but still showed no fear. His glance flicked past her shoulder, and she became aware that the rest of the squad was moving, closing up the distance to the ship. From the corner of her eye, she saw Caia gesturing direction – they were looking for the text. She said, ‘You are a heretic–’ ‘Then kill me.’ His grin was confident, now verging on crazed. ‘I do not fear His blessing.’ His eyes shone. ‘But I do His work, Sister, as do we all. Should I rise to His glory, another will take my place, and another, and another. I offer their youth, their lives, to Him. And He rewards me – us – well!’ ‘You slew Sister Clara.’ It was a rush of horror, a cold hand of realisation. ‘You slay all of them.’ ‘I grant them His blessing.’ His rictus grin was suitably skull-like. ‘This is Letum, it has always been this way. They wish the Throne, and we grant them their release. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much.’ ‘What knowledge?’ The man laughed, the noise dark and rich. ‘It is our secret, forbidden, not to be shared. Not even with you.’ ‘Or with the convent.’ The horror was crawling over Augusta’s skin now, writhing like the strands of creeper. ‘You murder them, and they do not even know why.’ ‘Murder?’ His grin faltered; he seemed genuinely confused. ‘We bless them, Sister. There is a plant here, grown with His blessing. A little in the food, that’s all it takes – and a heart fails.’ His sincerity was startling. ‘This is Letum. And this is His word, His way, His calling, His grace–’ ‘He’s crazed.’ Viola was starting to twitch – her need to open fire was tangible. Augusta, too, could feel her horror fusing to fury, that welcome rise of red rage that was His touch, showing her the way. But not yet. There was a thread to the man’s glee that she had yet to understand. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much. ‘Caia.’ Over the vox. ‘Report.’ ‘The ship’s been stripped,’ Caia returned. ‘Panels, wires, metalwork, everything. It’s a skeleton, there’s almost nothing left. Whatever they’re doing, it’s been going on for months.’ ‘I hear you.’ Augusta jammed her bolter, hard, under the man’s throat. ‘Where are you taking it?’ ‘I told you, that knowledge is forbidden.’ The man’s grin grew wider, his eyes flared. ‘He has spoken to me, in visions. He has decreed my path!’ ‘You utter both falsehood and blasphemy.’ She was really angry now. ‘You are a betrayer, faithless, and you presume to take His name?’ ‘I utter no falsehood, Sister. I hold faith, always. He has spoken to me, to all of us. He has sent us visions, taught us how to obey His creed. We believe in Him, we have held to His faith for generations.’ There was an honest plea in his voice. Viola, her voice dark with blood, said, ‘All those ships, Sister, those missing merchants’ vessels. Whatever this is, it’s larger than just the Aeris.’ ‘I agree,’ Augusta said. Thinking for a minute, she gave the squad the order to regroup on her location. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We will secure these… cultists’ – she refused to give them their title – ‘and follow the trail of their ported cargo. Let us pray, my Sisters, that He will take us to the end of this puzzle.’ Sister Caia had not yet managed to locate the sacred text, but Augusta would return to the main task of her mission once this matter was resolved. A brief scout showed a side chamber in the stone maw, a place where more cargo was piled. Carrying His authority and with the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her back, the Sister Superior commanded the frateris to amass within, and left Sister Alcina as their guard. Augusta had no wish to seek a potential foe with reduced strength, but these faithless heretics would face the justice of their Order’s canoness, the one they had betrayed. And Alcina’s sheer presence was enough to ensure their behaviour. The remaining five of the squad ducked into the hole. Following the stamped-down trail of bootsteps, they headed deep, deep beneath the gravestones. Swiftly, they left the thin, stormy daylight behind them and vanished into swallowing black. They turned on their suit lights, angled beams of illumination that picked out multiple layers, like rock strata, compressed into the walls. But the stripes were not rock. Letum had been a cemetery planet for millennia, and only its uppermost graves were still on the surface. These left trailing roots, ends of bone, fragments of grave goods, pieces of coffins. As the Sisters moved deeper, still following the stamped hard-route and the occasional dropped corroded brass cog, they found coffins in layers, like geological ages – pieces of older headstones, fragments of dead technology. Slices of stone ran round the walls, and before much longer, these began to spread out through the soil, opening to a smooth throat that was bitterly, shiveringly cold. Sealed in her armour, Augusta checked her temperature read-out and gestured for the five of them to slow down. Caia, still on point and still using her auspex, shook her head: no motion. But the Sister Superior knew they were coming to the heart of this. And that too-smooth stone was chillingly familiar. Walk with us, O Emperor. Bear your light to guide our bootsteps… With a prayer over the vox, they crept forwards, suit lights slanting through the pitch-dark. Akemi paused at a series of symbols, too ancient to even bear mould, but Augusta already knew what they were. She had seen them before. And they confirmed her suspicions. What else would hide this deep beneath the gravestones, teaching its cult of death? She paused, though she could not read the lettering. ‘It seems the frateris have been weak,’ she said. ‘They have betrayed their faith, fallen victim to something that yet lurks down here.’ Her voice was bleak. ‘It calls to them. And they listen.’ Viola hefted the heavy bolter. ‘It’s not going to call for much longer.’ The Sister Superior did not permit herself a chuckle. They moved on, deeper and colder, careful with every step. And then: blip. Only the one, and stationary. Ahead of them. ‘Close up formation. Viola, on point. Melia, take the rear.’ Over the vox, Augusta started to sing the battle litany, heard her Sisters join her, their harmonies clean and strong. The words were not spoken aloud, not down here, but they were familiar, His presence carried with them even into the darkest depths of this xenos-polluted world. We will remove the taint, she thought. Free our Sisters from this heretic grip! And then, they reached the mouth of the tunnel. And saw light. The light was green, taint and unholiness, and it flooded from a vast and upright gemstone in the centre of the room. The stone had no support – it turned slowly, floating free of a symbol-carved floor, concentric circles that pulled all eyes towards its central, gelid might. The walls, too, were etched in cyphers, studded with skulls, many of them encrusted with gems in their turn. Each one glittered like the eyes of the skulls in the cathedral. Watching. But that was not what made the Sisters pause. About the vast stone, shadows moved, hundreds, thousands of them – every one a piece of scavenged technology. From the Aeris, from the dozens, even hundreds of ships that had hove too close to the storm, and then crashed here, they now orbited the stone’s light slowly, like some drifting, asteroid eclipse, some floating of fragmented night. ‘Viola.’ Augusta did not hesitate. The younger Sister aimed the heavy bolter. Caia said, ‘Wait!’ Another blip, and another, and another. Augusta drew her chainsword, though she did not start the mechanism. Descending from the huge dome of the roof came shapes. Not more skulls, but three elongated, oddly insectoid figures with metallic and curling tails, and a multitude of eager, gleaming claws. They glowed with the same green light, and Augusta’s suspicions were confirmed. Necrons. Of course. She had time for one shout: ‘Don’t let them close!’ And then the Sisters were moving as one, shoulder to shoulder, all of them facing outwards. Roaring the words of the battle prayer, Viola opened fire. The noise was deafening. A full suppression exploded across the room; rounds tore upwards, targeting the descending figures. One monster was caught and sent spinning, another was buffeted physically backwards by the force of the attack. Wounds erupted across its body, spraying dark splashes of oil. It crashed against the wall and fell, crumpled. It didn’t move again. ‘In His name!’ There was the ring of victory in Viola’s voice. But the other two were still moving, and there were more blips incoming. Even as the Sisters opened fire, the things flickered and shifted, and the rounds went straight through them, striking sparks and debris from the walls and roof. ‘What–’ Akemi cut off the curse and kept shooting. ‘They phase!’ Augusta remembered all too well the world of Heqet, and the last time she’d seen a necron wraith. ‘Time your shooting!’ Viola turned the heavy bolter on the second figure, but it had already faded away. ‘We’ve got more of them,’ Caia said. ‘Dominica’s eyes.’ The auspex was alive with motion. ‘Move!’ Augusta bellowed. ‘To the tunnel mouth. Melia, we need the flamer!’ They moved, Viola covering. The younger Sister checked back over her shoulder, fell back as Melia came to the fore. And just in time, as a stream of clicking silver came pouring down the walls, scuttling even over the gemstone itself. Augusta had seen necron scarabs reduce a human to nothing in less than a second, take entire squads to pieces, armour and all. But Melia stood firm, framed by the green light of the tunnel mouth, her armour flaring scarlet at its edges. Watching the seethe, she waited. Augusta held her breath, trusting to her Sister’s experience. Then, with a cry of prayer, Melia loosed the full force of the flamer. Scarabs screeched like tortured metal, shattered with superheat. They crisped and turned over, curling up their legs. Keeping the flamer spraying, she moved it back and forth over the room’s floor, then up the walls towards the ceiling. Thick smoke filled the air, stinking. The creatures sparked and crackled. Then, without warning, Melia fell. One of the wraiths had reappeared, its claws embedded in her armour. Even as Augusta moved to shoot it, it was gone again, leaving Melia crumpled on the floor. The last of the scarabs headed instantly for her, clicking as they came. Caia, howling a prayer of her own, moved forwards to stamp on them. The words of the battle litany came from her in sheer, boiling fury. Sister Melia did not move. Augusta, eyes everywhere, searched the main chamber. ‘If there are wraiths, she said. ‘There’s likely to be a spider.’ She grinned, though the others could not see it. ‘Let’s coax it out, shall we? Viola, hit the phylactery.’ Raising the heavy bolter, Sister Viola blew the gemstone away. In the librarium, the canoness looked at the Sisters. The squad were battered and filthy, their armour damaged by the claws of the wraiths, by the insistent scuttle of the devouring scarabs. Melia was walking, though carefully; Alcina eyed the five of them with the faintest air of irritation, as if she had wanted to be in at the fighting. But she had brought the faithless frateris back with her, and their leader now stood before his canoness, his head up, his eyes blazing. There was no repentance in him, only a savage and eager joy. The rest of them had been placed in the convent’s crypts. For now. ‘Xenos, you say.’ Elderly though the canoness was, her voice still carried an edge, the true, righteous wrath of a Sister of Battle. ‘And their pollution rife amongst my people.’ Her gaze turned to the man, but he met it fearlessly, welcomed it. ‘I have done nothing wrong,’ he said. ‘Only embraced Him! His greatest gift!’ Swift as a thought, the canoness backhanded him. ‘How dare you?’ Her voice was livid with outrage. ‘Your blasphemy! Your betrayal!’ She was physically shaking, quivering with the kind of anger that should blister the skin of his face. ‘The Sisters of this Order that you have manipulated to their deaths!’ With a thump, she brought one hand down on the table, making her effigies and candles jump. ‘You have made a mockery of our very faith.’ The man said, again, ‘I have done nothing wrong! The great gem – it needs energy. Needed ships, supplies, power! Needs to build its forces once more! And it was His voice, His voice!’ The man staggered suddenly to his knees, reached for the hem of the canoness’ grey robe. ‘He spoke to me, milady. He came to me in a vision. A vision of death, and of pure, green light!’ The canoness stared down at him, pitiless. ‘And every time a Sister grew too close, it told you to end her life,’ Augusta said, her tone pure steel. ‘To make of her a sacrifice.’ ‘He spoke to me.’ The man, pleading now, looked from canoness to Sister Superior. ‘He wanted only to help them. He spoke to my father, to my mother, to their parents before them. He–’ ‘Enough.’ The canoness snatched her robe from the man’s grasp, swept it back to herself with a gesture that was all imperious scorn. ‘You have allied yourselves with a xenos power,’ Augusta said, grimly. ‘Caused the deaths of unknown numbers of His faithful. Your life is forfeit–’ ‘Wait,’ the canoness said. ‘Milady?’ ‘I have already said.’ The old lady sounded sad, now, her long years weighing heavy, but her eyes were like chips of flint. ‘We are not warriors, not like yourselves. We do His work, tending to those who have gone before us. But that work is not the work of warfare, it is the work of peace. Of His peace. Of that final peace that is granted in death, and in repose.’ She was staring at the frateris, who had a slow, horrific realisation breaking across his face. ‘I will not grant you that peace, heretic.’ Around Augusta, the squad shifted, understanding. ‘No…’ said the man. Abruptly, the canoness lost her temper. ‘You have made a lie of our very Order! You have taken the tenets of this convent, of its most holy teachings, and you have twisted them, offering them to a xenos power! You have betrayed everything that He means to us, to this world of the sacred dead!’ Now the man was cowering, sobs starting in his chest. His love for the old lady was honest; the shattering of his own lies almost too much to bear. He said, ‘But I had a vision… I was only bringing His blessing…’ ‘Your vision was falsehood,’ Augusta told him, still hard as rock. ‘You are no longer frateris. You are nothing.’ ‘You are nothing,’ the canoness agreed. ‘You will join your fellows in the crypt. And there you will stay. Until your shouts weaken, and your hunger and thirst grow unbearable. Until you find repentance in your heart. And I pray that when you do face Him, you will know your faithlessness and understand humility. In that way, your soul may yet be saved.’ Alcina was nodding, sternly approving. Melia had frowned, but said nothing. ‘And you, milady?’ Augusta asked. ‘What will you do, without your frateris?’ ‘Penance, Sister Superior,’ the canoness responded. ‘We allowed our faith to falter, to be corrupted by this ancient, xenos taint, and we did nothing. We allowed our young Sisters to be tricked to their deaths, and we did nothing. We only celebrated their ascension, knowing not what had caused it. We will offer our own labours in repentance. We will leave this closeted building, as we should have done long ago, and we will tend to the graves ourselves.’ She stopped, thinking for a minute, then finished, ‘I understand you have not yet found your text?’ Comprehending more than the question, Augusta responded, ‘No, milady, we have not. And it would be our honour to stay, even after our mission is completed.’ She looked round at the rest of the squad. ‘This world may yet have foes lurking beneath its surface. They must be sought out, and summarily slain.’ With the faintest flicker of a smile, the canoness nodded. ‘Then perhaps,’ she said, ‘we do have need for warriors, after all.’",

      "content": "Lightning tore through the sky. Seen through the cathedral’s massive glassaic window, it was a pure and holy wrath, flashing His image to brilliance. ‘O most Holy Emperor, grant to our Sister eternal rest!’ Beneath Him, at the altar, the slight, grey-robed form of the canoness raised her arms to His glory, her voice in the sacred requiem. Rolls of thunder joined her words, rumbling at the building’s walls, beating down upon its high and vaulted roof. ‘Let the light of your Throne shine upon her!’ Below the elderly figure, her congregation were mesmerised. In the foremost pew, helm off and head bowed as was proper, Sister Superior Augusta Santorus suppressed a shiver at His manifest might. His storm reigned perpetual, here on this tiny, forgotten world. ‘Hear my prayer, O Emperor. To you, all lives are owed! To you, all flesh must come!’ The requiem was unaccompanied – no organ, no music. Its harmonies were dense but unfamiliar, twisting through the acoustics in an eerie, minor key. Sister Akemi, to Augusta’s left side, shifted, shot a glance along the pew at Sister Melia. The storm grumbled on, like the anger in grief. Behind Augusta’s squad, the Sisters of the canoness’ Order and their frateris militia raised their own voices, responding to the litany. ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ ‘May her mind be raised to your glory!’ The service was a funeral. Despatched by the Ecclesiarchy and newly arrived upon Letum, Augusta had not known the young Sister who had passed to His grace. She’d had no time to speak to the canoness personally; instead, she had respectfully agreed to attend the service. But this… The image in the great Sol-facing window was not Him in His full glory, armoured and bearing His bright and flaming sword – it was Him as He would be, ancient and enthroned in cables. Before it, four ancient servo-skulls hovered like guardians, their metal corroded, but their green eyes sharp as gemstones. She could not shake the feeling that they watched her, analysing what they saw. Carefully, she honoured the hymn, though the responses were unknown. ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ ‘As we offer this, our Sister’s body, to the storm!’ The lightning flashed again, causing His image to blaze, for a split second, out across the nave, almost like He had been there in person. Chilled to the absolute bone by the undisciplined thought, Augusta offered a penitent prayer. Such was arrogance, and unforgiveable. This place was unsettling, true, but that was not a justification. Sister Viola, always the hothead, cursed under her breath. Alcina, the squad’s second-in-command, snapped the ghost of an order and Viola subsided. But Augusta’s odd, visceral shudder did not. Tiny and isolated, cut off by His never-ceasing storm, the Sisters of this convent were completely unknown. They wore no armour, their robes and cloaks were a beautifully embroidered grey, and rather than a fleur-de-lys, their faces were tattooed with the outline of a skull. They called themselves the Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. Letum was a cemetery planet, a world of gravestones and towering, carved sarcophagi. In millennia past, it had been a resting place for the Imperium’s most honoured dead, and a silent, stone civilisation had grown out around its endless corpses – spreading grids of sunken walkways, shrines and chapels like ossuaries, all studded with bones, locked reliquaries where only He still remembered their contents. Once, pilgrims had come here, to study the headstones or to tend to them – but no pilgrim had touched this world in centuries. Not since the coming of the storm and its restless, magnetic field. Any ship attempting to land here would be brought down by His lightning. The Imperium’s bureaucracy had known this, but Letum had little intrinsic value – no wealth or resources. Lost somewhere between endless scriveners, and now both unreachable and unimportant, it had been abandoned, and left to its veneration of death. Augusta stole a look upward, her head still bowed, her bobbed hair falling grey past her ears. Atop the altar, as grey as everything else, lay an open coffin; within it, the young Sister who had passed. The coffin was steel, beautifully wrought and etched in skulls; at either end, a conducting rod connected it to the cathedral’s outside wall. The thunder growled low, like anticipation. With the sound, the congregation’s expectancy rose. The canoness still prayed, her arms aloft, her words a torch, a hymn, a tocsin. ‘He comes!’ she said, her tone livid with passion. ‘Let us witness the touch of His light!’ Perhaps the flash of His image had been less arrogance, Augusta thought, and more a deliberate illustration of this convent’s empathic belief. But still, her shudder did not fade. She should have more discipline. Praying, she focused her thoughts. The canoness’ voice rose further. She had her congregation gripped, the three pews of her Sisters, the frateris further back. Her head tilted back, strands of her white hair floating upwards round her face, she was entreating His storm for its touch, calling it to her. And, much as Augusta tried to banish the unworthy thought, the storm seemed to be listening. The flashes, vivid and shocking, were coming closer; the gap between the light and the sound narrowed with every strike. Even as the Sister Superior stole another look, a crashing rumble of thunder sounded directly overhead. There was the sudden hiss of rain against the glassaic. The canoness cried, ‘Bring mercy! Release our Sister to your storm!’ Propelled, the congregation were on their feet. They returned her words, but their cries were staccato, now, scattered throughout the nave and rapidly becoming louder. Frenzy rang from them like the clashing of cymbals. ‘Release!’ ‘Have mercy!’ ‘He comes!’ Uneasy, Sister Viola flashed a look over her shoulder. As Augusta glanced sideways, she crossed gazes with the younger Sister’s bright green eyes, saw flickers of both concern and non-comprehension. Briefly, Viola raised an eyebrow, but Augusta only frowned, indicating that she should attend to her prayers. The canoness cried again, ‘He comes!’ ‘He comes!’ ‘Praise His lightning!’ ‘Praise it!’ Another flash. Another bellow, loud enough to shake the bell towers. Augusta prayed, then found herself catching her breath… For here, even as His image flashed down upon the altar itself, bright yellow crackled along the conducting rods, a spark like pure, bared adrenaline. The congregation cried aloud, one long, ‘Ah!’ And light detonated from the metal coffin. It was blinding, but the Sister Superior held her place, blinking the after-flash from her vision. His touch was gone. Instead, flames were crackling, warm and soft, from the coffin’s contents. There was the faint smell of burning wood and flesh; grey smoke curled, thick and greasy. Extractors hummed, though she could not see them. The still-hovering skulls glittered in new firelight. They grinned, wide and toothy, as though they had seen this a thousand times, yet had never tired of it. As though they knew secrets they would never tell. ‘By the Throne…’ Shaken, Viola swore again, her words a whisper. This time, neither Alcina nor Augusta corrected her. Whatever this funeral service was, the squad had never seen its like. The storm crashed in violent farewell, then, slowly, began to rumble away. ‘Sister Superior.’ The canoness’ voice was calm with authority, soft with age. Sitting by a polished table of real wood, its surface reflecting electro-candles and the red light of the hearth, she was a tiny figure, creased with the weight of years. ‘Milady,’ Augusta answered respectfully. ‘Sister Superior Augusta Santorus, Order of the Bloody Rose.’ She offered the sign of the aquila. ‘Ave Imperator.’ Following the recessional, the canoness had bade them follow in her footsteps. The walk through the bone-walled cloisters had been as unnerving as everything else, but the librarium was warm and the storm kept at bay by the thickness of both walls and curtains. ‘Indeed,’ the canoness said. ‘Ave Imperator, Sister Superior. His blessing upon you, and upon your squad. You will forgive me, I hope, for insisting that you attend our service? Sister Clara was very dear to me, as novice and as tender both, and while I know she kneels now at the foot of the Great Throne, I confess that I shall miss her.’ She smiled, the expression gentle. ‘His ways are strange, are they not?’ At Augusta’s left shoulder, Alcina answered, ‘It is not our place to question them, milady.’ ‘Of course, of course.’ Without losing her smile, the canoness gestured for the Sister to subside. ‘Yet I find that age has brought a… certain restlessness to my soul. It is unusual for anyone, upon our world so tiny, to live to the years that I have done. And I find myself lonely, eagerly awaiting my turn for His greatest blessing.’ To Augusta’s other side, Melia and Caia, one as dusky as the other was blonde, exchanged a glance. They were close as blood-kin, had come up through the schola together – the nearness of the canoness to her friend would touch them deeply. Sister Viola, here bereft of her thrice-blessed heavy bolter, creaked as she shifted on her toes; the last and youngest member of the squad, Sister Akemi, was gazing raptly round at the bookshelves, lured by the promise of previously unseen lore. But Augusta was focused on the canoness. ‘Milady, it was our honour to attend your service, though its litanies were unfamiliar. You will forgive our lack of knowledge in not responding – no insult was intended.’ ‘And none was taken, Sister Superior.’ The canoness gestured at her servitors, which were laying tiny, perfect plates upon the table, each one offering some sort of fungus-based pastries. With a quiet bow, the grey-hooded figures withdrew. ‘Now, you must tell me of your Order – I have seen such armour only in my books, and yet here it is, the colour of new blood. And you must tell me why He has brought you here, Sister, to my little convent, so long untouched by the Imperium’s… warriors.’ There was an odd stress on the word ‘warriors’, but this was an uncharted corner of the void in more ways than one. Navigating carefully, Augusta offered no correction of the term. Instead, she said, ‘We seek a ship, milady, crash-landed upon your world. It bears a sacred text that I am charged to retrieve.’ ‘A ship?’ The elderly lady put her head to one side, almost birdlike in fine-boned fragility. Her white hair, neatly bunned but loose tendrils still crackling with remembered electricity, gleamed in the hearth-light, and her skull outline seemed oddly prominent, for all its age. ‘Sister Superior, no ships come to this world, crashed or otherwise. He has decreed our isolation, and we are gladly alone, caretakers of this, His most holy cemetery.’ Lines round her eyes crinkled with affection or wariness. ‘Truly, we are the servants of His last and greatest blessing.’ Viola opened her mouth, realised the answer, shut it again. But the canoness’ perception was sharp. ‘Our release, my fire-haired Sister. Our blessed ascension to the Great Throne, where we may at last witness His suspension and His glory. Truly, there is no greater gift.’ Her words glittered, dark and ardent. ‘He is the ultimate expression of the faith of my Order. The visage of death.’ At the word, thunder grumbled, and the canoness turned away to gaze upon the storm. Alcina shifted, but Augusta flicked a hand, discreetly and by her hip. Over the tight-beam vox-link, she subvocalised, ‘We must tread carefully, Sister. This place unsettles me, and I do not know why.’ ‘I hear you.’ Alcina’s response was laden with tension. Akemi was still staring at the books, her head turning sideways to read their spines. ‘You are a scholar?’ The canoness addressed the youngest Sister, making her start and turn back. ‘Yes, milady.’ ‘Mmm.’ The old woman studied Akemi’s shining black hair, her pale skin, the relative newness of her fleur-de-lys tattoo. Like the skulls, she seemed to be analysing what she saw. ‘There is much lore here,’ she said. ‘It has been gathered from many places upon this world. Like my Sisters of this Order, our frateris militia have little use for combat. In place of such training, they tend to the headstones and shrines, as is proper, while we perform His ancient rites here, in the Great Cathedral. Sometimes, they bring to us things for which we must care – books, particularly, are vulnerable to the storm.’ There was something in her tone, an edge, the faintest hint of some deep curiosity. Akemi responded, her voice respectfully even. ‘Yes, milady.’ The canoness chuckled. ‘You are perfectly behaved, young one.’ She tapped thin, claw-like fingers against her cheek. ‘So, little scholar, you shall stay. You shall bless me with your lore and tell me of your Order. Explain to me your flower symbol. It is a rose, is it not?’ Akemi shot a glance at Augusta. ‘Surely, milady, the Sister Superior…?’ Again, the elderly canoness waved her hand. ‘I have already said’ – the phrase was faintly sharp, a warning of discipline – ‘that combat is of little use here. A chamber awaits you, Sister Superior, and a quiet supper will be served in the refectorium. You are welcome to join us, of course. You – Akemi, isn’t it? – you will stay.’ Brooking no argument, she turned back to the bookshelf, as if searching for something she wished to show Akemi. ‘Sister Superior?’ Akemi’s subvocalised voice came over the squad-vox, wary and requesting permission. Augusta repeated the warning she had given Alcina, then said, ‘She is canoness of her Order and we do not disobey. But speak little, Akemi, and listen to every word she offers. Ask questions, if you are permitted.’ Privately, she thanked His wisdom that the canoness had selected Akemi and not Viola. ‘We must locate our missing text. And this place perturbs me, for reasons I cannot yet fathom.’ The refectorium was a small and circular chamber, figures of saints standing about its edges, and every one with its face pared down to a skull. Some were familiar – Celestine herself was here – but there were others that Augusta did not know, perhaps representations from headstones that the frateris had found or tended. Viola fidgeted; Melia, too, seemed oddly unsettled and, after partaking of a quiet meal, the Sisters returned to their sleeping chamber still restless, their hunger satisfied but not their unease. Once their door was closed, Viola exploded with withheld tension. ‘That was no grace that I have ever heard! We offer Him thanks for our victuals, not repentance that we must live another–’ ‘Silence.’ Augusta’s response was soft, but brooked no argument. Over their private channel, she said, ‘Caia, I want a complete technical sweep of this chamber and its surrounding area, as far as your auspex can reach. And I want to know where we are in relation to the estimated crash site. Between ourselves, we will communicate only over the vox.’ ‘Very wise.’ Alcina’s tone was all warning. ‘There is much here that defies my comprehension. While each Order bears its own prayers and hymns, these Sisters behave in a way that is… unusual.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘We will await Akemi, and any insight she brings,’ Augusta said. ‘But yes, I agree. There is something deeply amiss about this place. His voice speaks in my heart, and I must listen to His warnings.’ ‘The canoness told us the Soul of Aeris didn’t crash,’ Viola agreed. ‘We know that the ship’s last communication was of the storm. And they won’t let me carry my weapon.’ The words had an edge, the source of her restlessness. ‘Not only that,’ Melia said, her tone dark. ‘But the young Sister who perished – she was barely in her twenties, and in full health. I consider it unlikely that she perished from cardiac failure, as we have been told…’ Melia was trained by the Order of Serenity, and the squad’s medicae. She gave a twitch of a shrug, and her pauldron clattered. ‘The canoness seems learned, she must know this. Which would mean that she has uttered an open falsehood, before Him, in a sermon of holy worship. This is more than “unusual”, Sisters.’ There was a twist of horror to her words. ‘This is unthinkable.’ Augusta nodded, thinking. ‘Sister Caia?’ ‘The crash site is approximately seven miles south-south-east of here.’ Caia lowered her auspex, its green wash of light fading. ‘With the density of the storm it is plausible that the descent of the ship went unnoticed. I can tell little more from here.’ ‘And are we being observed?’ ‘Not by machine-spirits.’ ‘There are ways, and ways.’ The comment was a thought, voiced over the vox. Aloud, the Sister Superior said, ‘Come, sing with me, my Sisters. Let us celebrate our finding of this Order, so newly joined to the Adepta Sororitas. We will raise our voices in His glory, and sing our requiem for Sister Clara. Sister Alcina, if you would.’ Alcina’s voice was a deep, full contralto; it rolled almost like the storm. It also allowed Augusta to listen. Not with the vox, but with her ears. And, as the other Sisters joined the hymnal, their harmonies as clean as the cathedral’s service had been eerie, she knew. She had heard these acoustics before. The convent may not have the technology to overhear, but every word the Sisters said was echoing back through the old, stone passages, and – she would have to assume – directly to the ears of the canoness. ‘My apologies, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said, when she returned. Like the others, she kept her words over the vox. ‘I was able to glean little. I told her of the younger Orders, of Deacis VI and of the Bloody and the Sacred Rose. Of our most holy saints Mina and Arabella. But she offered little in return. She did repeat, however, that she does not believe that the Aeris crashed here. Until our arrival, they had not seen a single Imperial vessel, of any size or description, in possibly millennia.’ ‘Millennia.’ Her armour off, laid out upon its sacred mat, Augusta knelt in her under-armour, the rose-red gambeson that helped to absorb incoming blows. The squad’s briefing had been very specific – they were to find the fallen ship, and the text that it had carried. And it was not just the Aeris. As the Sisters had crossed the vast steams of the empyrean, approaching this tiny corner of space, so Augusta had taken breaks from her squad’s training to learn as much as she could about Letum and its ceaseless storm. ‘We know,’ she said, ‘that the Aeris is not the only lost ship. Merchants’ vessels have gone missing near here, though nothing large or significant. Individually, they are unnoticeable, tiny cogs in a huge machine. But, if you put enough cogs together…’ She stopped, thinking. What she was about to suggest was, at best, a lack of protocol, at worst, downright blasphemous, but His calling in her heart was strong. As strong as it had been on Lycheate, with the doomed, crazed Inquisitor Istrix – she knew that something was wrong. In her mind, she saw the image-flash of the cathedral window, the lightning casting His image upon the stone. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, I am going to do something… unwise.’ Alcina raised a faintly acerbic eyebrow, but said nothing. ‘I will do this alone, take full responsibility for my actions. If questioned, you were following my orders.’ ‘You’re not going out there,’ Caia said, ever-perceptive. ‘The force of the storm–’ ‘That is not your decision to make, Sister,’ she answered, with a warning eyebrow. ‘I will not take my armour, it will make far too much noise. I will take my bolter, however, though only as a precaution. The canoness was right about one thing – there is no need for combat. Whatever else this place may be, it is a place of peace.’ Too much peace, I suspect. ‘Sister Superior.’ Alcina turned, squaring her shoulders. Already understanding her second’s disapproving expression, Augusta only nodded. ‘I hear you, Sister, and you are not wrong. But we have a mission, and we must succeed in that mission. And there are times when that mission is not about a war.’ A flicker of a smile. ‘Though I confess, that unsettles me just as much as the atmosphere of this convent.’ The smile faded again. ‘By His grace and blessing, we have come through the storm. He landed us safely for a reason.’ Viola fidgeted, but said nothing. Akemi said, ‘Let me come with you, Sister. I can be quiet, and I may… I may be able to read the gravestones’ ancient symbols, where you cannot.’ Augusta gave the youngest Sister a long look, then nodded. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘Sisters, we will stay in vox-contact. I will recite the opening words of the Treatise, every fifteen minutes, beginning at the hour of Evensong. If I do not…’ Her smile turned mirthless. ‘Then don your wargear, in His name, and seek answers of the canoness. If she gives none, then you head for the crash site and complete the mission.’ ‘I strongly advise against this, Sister,’ Alcina said, sternly disapproving. ‘We should head for that crash site now–’ ‘Objection noted,’ Augusta said. ‘Akemi?’ The youngest Sister, slight out of her armour but wrought from steel wire, inhaled like she was bracing herself. ‘Yes, Sister Superior. And may He bless our explorations.’ May He bless our explorations. The convent was quiet, its cloisters open to the storm and charged with the electricity in the air. The hairs on Augusta’s forearms were standing on end and her skin prickled with it, as if covered in crawlers. From the cathedral transept, there came a twining of Evensong voices – another eerie, minor-key harmony. Akemi walked silently, her small face creased in a frown. Skulls in the cloisters’ carved ceilings leered toothily as they passed. ‘What bothers you, Sister?’ Augusta’s voice was barely a whisper, sounding in Akemi’s vox-bead. ‘Forgive me, Sister Superior,’ Akemi said. ‘I am thinking. We, alone, of possibly hundreds of ships, have been able to land here, our pilot blessed by Him to bring us safely through the storm. Yet the canoness has said this world is isolated by His design. I cannot resolve these two things. Has He brought us here? Or are we unwelcome, in defiance of His wishes?’ ‘Have faith, Akemi,’ Augusta answered, her confidence complete. ‘The loss of the Aeris, and the text she bears – this was His way to guide us to this world, and to our lost Sisters. Whatever takes place, He has brought us here to see it.’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Akemi said nothing more, and they kept walking. The cloisters were a large quadrangle, surrounding a flagstoned square with a great and many-layered fountain at its centre. Rainwater chuckled, overspilling the fountain’s edges. Side doors offered storage chambers: places where the attending frateris would care for the life of the cathedral, its kneeling mats, censers and hymn books. Another door led to the sacristy, where the Sisters’ grey robes could be stored. Carefully, Augusta pushed at it, but it was locked. From the transept, Evensong rose to its crescendo, shivering outwards across the storm. Lightning flashed, though not closely; the thunder was a distance away. Soon, they reached the cloisters’ outermost corner and paused. An arched and open doorway offered a short flight of stone steps and a gravel path that curved onwards through the building’s closest graveyard. The rain had thinned to a gentle, drifting mist, and upright lumens offered cold white pools of illumination. Thunder grumbled, distant now. Everything lurked ghostlike, fogged and monochrome. Waiting. Augusta began to wish she’d brought her armour, noisy though it was. It was so much a part of her, of her faith and capability, that she felt acutely vulnerable without it. ‘What are we looking for, Sister?’ Akemi asked her. ‘Answers,’ Augusta said. ‘There is more to this than a downed ship.’ Out across the pale light, there were shifting, grey-clad shapes, almost unseen – the frateris, tending the stones even at this late hour. In the mist, they looked like phantoms. ‘This way.’ Very conscious of her scarlet padding, Augusta moved along the side of the building, circling it carefully. Akemi followed, looking at the gravestones, some of them embedded in the wall. As they reached the back of the building, and began a slightly wider circle, Akemi stopped. ‘Sister,’ she said. Instantly, the Sister Superior froze. ‘What?’ ‘This stone’s been moved.’ ‘It is surely the stone of Sister Clara? ‘Not here, Sister,’ Akemi said. ‘Clara’s ashes will be interred in the Sisters’ own sarcophagus, the canoness did tell me that much. This…’ She sounded puzzled. ‘This is something else.’ ‘Explain.’ Drawing a breath, Akemi answered. ‘The canoness’ books are almost all in High Gothic. It’s a very old form, with some linguistic variations, but it’s essentially familiar. And it ties in with her claim that the frateris have retrieved them from the graves, in order to preserve them. But that…’ She nodded at the stone. It had three oddly shaped skulls engraved in its top, a prayer inscribed beneath. ‘That’s older. Much older. That stone is significantly older than the cathedral itself.’ Augusta shot the youngest Sister a sharp look. ‘So it’s been placed here since?’ Akemi nodded, her thoughts coalescing as she spoke. ‘It must have been brought here from somewhere else, laid into the wall when the cathedral was built. And that, in turn, would imply that something has been here–’ ‘For longer than the Sisters.’ Augusta considered this, nodding. ‘I–’ ‘Sister Superior.’ Startled, Augusta turned. She was unsettled indeed if anyone could come this close, unheard and undetected. Instinctively, her hand had gone for her bolter, but she drew it back – this was one of the frateris, a grey-cloaked figure, his hood back. His face was young and lean, and etched with shadows from the overhead lumens. ‘Yes?’ Arching an austere eyebrow, she offered no apology or explanation. ‘It is late, Sisters.’ The man’s tone was chillingly polite. ‘The canoness has asked us to ensure your welfare, and you should be resting before Nightfall prayers.’ His eyes were dark sockets, as skull-like as everything else in that place. ‘She will be expecting you.’ He leaned on the word, just enough. ‘And we will attend, of course,’ Augusta answered him, her authority smooth and unchallenged. ‘But perhaps, since you are here, you can answer a question.’ ‘Forgive me, Sister,’ the young man said, as smoothly polished as the canoness’ tabletop. ‘This is hardly the place for questions. You are guests of the convent. And you should be attending milady canoness.’ There was a warning in his tone, a blade sheathed but ready. And while his words were carefully chosen, his behaviour was verging on arrogant. ‘He’s hiding something,’ Akemi said, over the vox. ‘I agree,’ Augusta answered her. ‘But what?’ The Sister Superior returned to the chamber with few answers, only more questions. Remaining within, she and the squad observed the Nightfall prayer by themselves, offering their words to His sacred effigy that had come with them from Ophelia VII. The Sister Superior prayed for divine guidance – not the usual litany, but with words that came from her heart. The image from the cathedral window had stayed with her, as if flash-etched onto her retinae. She had distinct suspicions – graveyard world, older culture – such things were ­inevitable. But without tangible proof, she could hardly make accusations. Why was that headstone in the cathedral wall? Where had it come from? And why had she seen only younger faces? Aside from the old lady, every Sister, every servitor, every member of the frateris militia had been under thirty – significantly younger than Augusta herself. The thought came with smoke-curls of sinister possibilities, coiling like the life of Sister Clara. The Order of the Broken Sepulchre. The Sisters of Death. There was only one way to find an answer. In the morning, after the dawn prayer, the squad donned full armour and attended, as was proper, the canoness’ wishes. The old lady was as polite as ever, saying nothing about the previous evening’s excursion. Augusta wasn’t sure if that was simply due to decorum, or because she genuinely didn’t know. Had the frateris not told her? Such a lack of discipline and respect – that was unheard of. Just who was lying to whom? ‘With your permission, milady,’ she said. ‘We must seek the Aeris.’ Answering the canoness’ query about their mission, Augusta fully intended to get to the bottom of this. ‘I have her approximate coordinates and my mission directive is very clear. If the ship’s resting place is here, then He will guide us to its side.’ ‘Of course,’ the old lady said. ‘Victuals have been prepared for you. I do not believe the ship is here, but you must undertake your mission. Go, with His blessing.’ Her permission was confusing. Viola, much happier now her heavy bolter had been returned, commented darkly as they headed out, ‘Did she not deny that the ship was here? Then why grant us permission to seek its location? She says one thing and then she says another. We should confront her.’ ‘I agree,’ Alcina said. ‘I do not like this… sneaking.’ ‘I don’t think so,’ Caia disagreed. ‘Her words were sincere. She endeavours only to help, to facilitate our mission.’ She looked round at her Sisters, her red helm glistening with rain. ‘I do not doubt her faith.’ ‘This place is rotten,’ Viola muttered. ‘It stinks.’ Despite the filters in the Sisters’ armour, smells of death lingered, of bones and dust. The place seemed old, serenely quiet, its headstones pulled down by reaching creepers, its occasional dark trees all swarmed with ivy. Thunder still grumbled, but remained a distance away. Following Caia’s auspex, they wound their way through the endless criss-cross of sunken walkways. Akemi watched both sides, her head turning back and forth like a lighthouse; Melia carried the rations that the servitors had prepared for them. Alcina walked at the rear, still sternly disapproving of Augusta’s choices. But without proof, Augusta could say nothing. ‘There,’ Caia said. The green glare of the auspex shone out through thin, ever-clouded morning light. ‘Over the rise.’ Beneath the storm, the Aeris lay dead, her hard, angular shape silhouetted by the thunderous sky. She was an exploratory-class vessel, small compared to the frigates and destroyers of the Imperial Navy, and she lay broken on her side, half buried in blackened soil and shattered headstones. Her nose was completely covered, her adamantine plating charred by lightning and extreme heat; the Sisters could see the huge, miles-long burn-scar, crashing through walls and statues, that her death had ripped in the ground. ‘Hold.’ At Augusta’s order, the Sisters dropped at the lip of the ridge. They lay on their bellies, looking over at the downed ship. Caia’s auspex flickered green: movement. Only a dozen blips, but enough. ‘They cannot be crew?’ Melia said, puzzled. ‘It has taken us four months to reach this planet,’ Augusta answered. ‘Any survivors would already have been found by the convent.’ ‘Unless they chose to hide,’ Akemi suggested. Viola muttered, ‘Then why are they moving now?’ For a moment, the scent of Sister Clara’s burning coffin seemed to hang in the air. Dismissing whimsy, Augusta raised her magnoculars, and took a closer look. Immediately, she lowered them, blinking, and passed them to Sister Alcina. ‘Tell me what you see, Sister.’ Frowning, Alcina took her turn. ‘No survivors,’ she said. ‘The saviour pods were never even launched. I suspect the storm slew the ship’s machine-spirit and the Aeris never had a chance – she crashed powerless. It is unlikely the crew survived. And I see…’ She reared back, blinked exactly like Augusta had done, looked once again through the magnoculars. ‘By the Throne. Truly, Sister Superior, He has brought us here for a deeper purpose.’ ‘What?’ Viola, her shoulder against the heavy bolter, almost crackled with impatience. Augusta nodded. ‘We have our answers, Sisters,’ she said. ‘The frateris are stripping salvage from the ship. And my heart tells me this is not for the canoness’ use. ‘Move!’ The bark was soft; the Sisters skirmished, and fast. While the frateris were neither armed nor armoured, Augusta still held to her lingering suspicion that there was another power at work here. Something else, something older. Something that had built headstones, long before the founding of the cathedral. And something that, during the Imperium’s absence, had seeped slowly back to the surface. Something xenos. Three of the Sisters ran forwards, dropped behind graves and statues, then offered cover while the other three ran – the movements were instinctive, perfectly executed, smooth as gun oil. Caia, silent and on point, indicated with one arm and the squad bore left, passing the nose of the downed ship, and holding to the heavy, cold undershadow of its huge and looming belly. Carefully, slowing down now, they approached a shattered wall. And beneath it, a yawning, stone-lined void, black as betrayal, and half collapsed by the ship’s corpse. Voices became audible, echoing from burn-scarred metal. ‘Don’t drop it, you damned oaf. Take it to the entrance, put it on the pile.’ Grumbles and grunts followed. Whatever the cargo, it was heavy. Augusta half expected the whine of a loader, but there was nothing. ‘And you!’ The voice was familiar. ‘Stop dawdling!’ Akemi said, her voice a whisper, ‘That’s–’ ‘Last night’s challenger.’ The Sister Superior couldn’t muster surprise ‘Of course it is.’ She controlled a need to curse – suddenly, this was all fitting together. Over the vox, she said, ‘Viola, with me. The rest of you, stay and cover. Alcina, eyes and ears open. Caia, I want locations on everything moving. And find me that text!’ ‘Yes, Sister.’ Viola and the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her shoulder, Augusta rose from her cover, and issued a flat command. ‘You.’ The word was a bark, aimed at the man who had spoken. ‘This is an Imperial vessel, under examination by the Adepta Sororitas. Put down your cargo, lie belly down on the floor.’ Figures turned, glanced at each other, wondered what was going on. ‘Now.’ No one moved. They stared at the red-armoured figures of the Sisters. Augusta said, ‘Three… two… one…’ As the countdown reached zero, she shot the closest figure, straight through the chest. The detonation was echoing-loud; scarlet exploded across ground and stone and the ship’s underside. Still, the figures did not move. Viola hefted the heavy bolter, waiting for the order. ‘Sister Superior,’ the man said, amused and exasperated. He was indeed the same figure that they’d seen the previous night, cadaverous and austere, despite his youth. ‘I told you – you should be at prayers, attending the canoness. I was intending to retrieve your relic for you. Before you… came looking.’ Despite the death of his fellow, he had a flat absence of either surprise or fear. And there was an implication to his phrase that she didn’t quite follow. Using her preysight, she scanned him for weapons, found none, but still, she did not dismiss the threat. His confidence was bothering her – what didn’t she know? She walked forwards, focused on the speaker. Viola walked with her, focused everywhere else. ‘Move away from the ship.’ ‘Please, Sister.’ The man spread his hands, smiling. ‘This is not your concern.’ Bolter in the other hand, Augusta grabbed him by a fistful of grey shirt, slammed his back against the blood-spattered corpse of the Aeris. ‘You are frateris militia, and you do not speak to me, or to any Sister, with such lack of respect. Your life belongs to Him, and to the convent. You are sworn to His service.’ She made an assumption, ran with it. ‘Why do you lie to your canoness?’ What are you hiding? The man narrowed his gaze, but still showed no fear. His glance flicked past her shoulder, and she became aware that the rest of the squad was moving, closing up the distance to the ship. From the corner of her eye, she saw Caia gesturing direction – they were looking for the text. She said, ‘You are a heretic–’ ‘Then kill me.’ His grin was confident, now verging on crazed. ‘I do not fear His blessing.’ His eyes shone. ‘But I do His work, Sister, as do we all. Should I rise to His glory, another will take my place, and another, and another. I offer their youth, their lives, to Him. And He rewards me – us – well!’ ‘You slew Sister Clara.’ It was a rush of horror, a cold hand of realisation. ‘You slay all of them.’ ‘I grant them His blessing.’ His rictus grin was suitably skull-like. ‘This is Letum, it has always been this way. They wish the Throne, and we grant them their release. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much.’ ‘What knowledge?’ The man laughed, the noise dark and rich. ‘It is our secret, forbidden, not to be shared. Not even with you.’ ‘Or with the convent.’ The horror was crawling over Augusta’s skin now, writhing like the strands of creeper. ‘You murder them, and they do not even know why.’ ‘Murder?’ His grin faltered; he seemed genuinely confused. ‘We bless them, Sister. There is a plant here, grown with His blessing. A little in the food, that’s all it takes – and a heart fails.’ His sincerity was startling. ‘This is Letum. And this is His word, His way, His calling, His grace–’ ‘He’s crazed.’ Viola was starting to twitch – her need to open fire was tangible. Augusta, too, could feel her horror fusing to fury, that welcome rise of red rage that was His touch, showing her the way. But not yet. There was a thread to the man’s glee that she had yet to understand. We release ourselves, also, when our knowledge becomes too much. ‘Caia.’ Over the vox. ‘Report.’ ‘The ship’s been stripped,’ Caia returned. ‘Panels, wires, metalwork, everything. It’s a skeleton, there’s almost nothing left. Whatever they’re doing, it’s been going on for months.’ ‘I hear you.’ Augusta jammed her bolter, hard, under the man’s throat. ‘Where are you taking it?’ ‘I told you, that knowledge is forbidden.’ The man’s grin grew wider, his eyes flared. ‘He has spoken to me, in visions. He has decreed my path!’ ‘You utter both falsehood and blasphemy.’ She was really angry now. ‘You are a betrayer, faithless, and you presume to take His name?’ ‘I utter no falsehood, Sister. I hold faith, always. He has spoken to me, to all of us. He has sent us visions, taught us how to obey His creed. We believe in Him, we have held to His faith for generations.’ There was an honest plea in his voice. Viola, her voice dark with blood, said, ‘All those ships, Sister, those missing merchants’ vessels. Whatever this is, it’s larger than just the Aeris.’ ‘I agree,’ Augusta said. Thinking for a minute, she gave the squad the order to regroup on her location. ‘Very well,’ she said. ‘We will secure these… cultists’ – she refused to give them their title – ‘and follow the trail of their ported cargo. Let us pray, my Sisters, that He will take us to the end of this puzzle.’ Sister Caia had not yet managed to locate the sacred text, but Augusta would return to the main task of her mission once this matter was resolved. A brief scout showed a side chamber in the stone maw, a place where more cargo was piled. Carrying His authority and with the thrice-blessed heavy bolter at her back, the Sister Superior commanded the frateris to amass within, and left Sister Alcina as their guard. Augusta had no wish to seek a potential foe with reduced strength, but these faithless heretics would face the justice of their Order’s canoness, the one they had betrayed. And Alcina’s sheer presence was enough to ensure their behaviour. The remaining five of the squad ducked into the hole. Following the stamped-down trail of bootsteps, they headed deep, deep beneath the gravestones. Swiftly, they left the thin, stormy daylight behind them and vanished into swallowing black. They turned on their suit lights, angled beams of illumination that picked out multiple layers, like rock strata, compressed into the walls. But the stripes were not rock. Letum had been a cemetery planet for millennia, and only its uppermost graves were still on the surface. These left trailing roots, ends of bone, fragments of grave goods, pieces of coffins. As the Sisters moved deeper, still following the stamped hard-route and the occasional dropped corroded brass cog, they found coffins in layers, like geological ages – pieces of older headstones, fragments of dead technology. Slices of stone ran round the walls, and before much longer, these began to spread out through the soil, opening to a smooth throat that was bitterly, shiveringly cold. Sealed in her armour, Augusta checked her temperature read-out and gestured for the five of them to slow down. Caia, still on point and still using her auspex, shook her head: no motion. But the Sister Superior knew they were coming to the heart of this. And that too-smooth stone was chillingly familiar. Walk with us, O Emperor. Bear your light to guide our bootsteps… With a prayer over the vox, they crept forwards, suit lights slanting through the pitch-dark. Akemi paused at a series of symbols, too ancient to even bear mould, but Augusta already knew what they were. She had seen them before. And they confirmed her suspicions. What else would hide this deep beneath the gravestones, teaching its cult of death? She paused, though she could not read the lettering. ‘It seems the frateris have been weak,’ she said. ‘They have betrayed their faith, fallen victim to something that yet lurks down here.’ Her voice was bleak. ‘It calls to them. And they listen.’ Viola hefted the heavy bolter. ‘It’s not going to call for much longer.’ The Sister Superior did not permit herself a chuckle. They moved on, deeper and colder, careful with every step. And then: blip. Only the one, and stationary. Ahead of them. ‘Close up formation. Viola, on point. Melia, take the rear.’ Over the vox, Augusta started to sing the battle litany, heard her Sisters join her, their harmonies clean and strong. The words were not spoken aloud, not down here, but they were familiar, His presence carried with them even into the darkest depths of this xenos-polluted world. We will remove the taint, she thought. Free our Sisters from this heretic grip! And then, they reached the mouth of the tunnel. And saw light. The light was green, taint and unholiness, and it flooded from a vast and upright gemstone in the centre of the room. The stone had no support – it turned slowly, floating free of a symbol-carved floor, concentric circles that pulled all eyes towards its central, gelid might. The walls, too, were etched in cyphers, studded with skulls, many of them encrusted with gems in their turn. Each one glittered like the eyes of the skulls in the cathedral. Watching. But that was not what made the Sisters pause. About the vast stone, shadows moved, hundreds, thousands of them – every one a piece of scavenged technology. From the Aeris, from the dozens, even hundreds of ships that had hove too close to the storm, and then crashed here, they now orbited the stone’s light slowly, like some drifting, asteroid eclipse, some floating of fragmented night. ‘Viola.’ Augusta did not hesitate. The younger Sister aimed the heavy bolter. Caia said, ‘Wait!’ Another blip, and another, and another. Augusta drew her chainsword, though she did not start the mechanism. Descending from the huge dome of the roof came shapes. Not more skulls, but three elongated, oddly insectoid figures with metallic and curling tails, and a multitude of eager, gleaming claws. They glowed with the same green light, and Augusta’s suspicions were confirmed. Necrons. Of course. She had time for one shout: ‘Don’t let them close!’ And then the Sisters were moving as one, shoulder to shoulder, all of them facing outwards. Roaring the words of the battle prayer, Viola opened fire. The noise was deafening. A full suppression exploded across the room; rounds tore upwards, targeting the descending figures. One monster was caught and sent spinning, another was buffeted physically backwards by the force of the attack. Wounds erupted across its body, spraying dark splashes of oil. It crashed against the wall and fell, crumpled. It didn’t move again. ‘In His name!’ There was the ring of victory in Viola’s voice. But the other two were still moving, and there were more blips incoming. Even as the Sisters opened fire, the things flickered and shifted, and the rounds went straight through them, striking sparks and debris from the walls and roof. ‘What–’ Akemi cut off the curse and kept shooting. ‘They phase!’ Augusta remembered all too well the world of Heqet, and the last time she’d seen a necron wraith. ‘Time your shooting!’ Viola turned the heavy bolter on the second figure, but it had already faded away. ‘We’ve got more of them,’ Caia said. ‘Dominica’s eyes.’ The auspex was alive with motion. ‘Move!’ Augusta bellowed. ‘To the tunnel mouth. Melia, we need the flamer!’ They moved, Viola covering. The younger Sister checked back over her shoulder, fell back as Melia came to the fore. And just in time, as a stream of clicking silver came pouring down the walls, scuttling even over the gemstone itself. Augusta had seen necron scarabs reduce a human to nothing in less than a second, take entire squads to pieces, armour and all. But Melia stood firm, framed by the green light of the tunnel mouth, her armour flaring scarlet at its edges. Watching the seethe, she waited. Augusta held her breath, trusting to her Sister’s experience. Then, with a cry of prayer, Melia loosed the full force of the flamer. Scarabs screeched like tortured metal, shattered with superheat. They crisped and turned over, curling up their legs. Keeping the flamer spraying, she moved it back and forth over the room’s floor, then up the walls towards the ceiling. Thick smoke filled the air, stinking. The creatures sparked and crackled. Then, without warning, Melia fell. One of the wraiths had reappeared, its claws embedded in her armour. Even as Augusta moved to shoot it, it was gone again, leaving Melia crumpled on the floor. The last of the scarabs headed instantly for her, clicking as they came. Caia, howling a prayer of her own, moved forwards to stamp on them. The words of the battle litany came from her in sheer, boiling fury. Sister Melia did not move. Augusta, eyes everywhere, searched the main chamber. ‘If there are wraiths, she said. ‘There’s likely to be a spider.’ She grinned, though the others could not see it. ‘Let’s coax it out, shall we? Viola, hit the phylactery.’ Raising the heavy bolter, Sister Viola blew the gemstone away. In the librarium, the canoness looked at the Sisters. The squad were battered and filthy, their armour damaged by the claws of the wraiths, by the insistent scuttle of the devouring scarabs. Melia was walking, though carefully; Alcina eyed the five of them with the faintest air of irritation, as if she had wanted to be in at the fighting. But she had brought the faithless frateris back with her, and their leader now stood before his canoness, his head up, his eyes blazing. There was no repentance in him, only a savage and eager joy. The rest of them had been placed in the convent’s crypts. For now. ‘Xenos, you say.’ Elderly though the canoness was, her voice still carried an edge, the true, righteous wrath of a Sister of Battle. ‘And their pollution rife amongst my people.’ Her gaze turned to the man, but he met it fearlessly, welcomed it. ‘I have done nothing wrong,’ he said. ‘Only embraced Him! His greatest gift!’ Swift as a thought, the canoness backhanded him. ‘How dare you?’ Her voice was livid with outrage. ‘Your blasphemy! Your betrayal!’ She was physically shaking, quivering with the kind of anger that should blister the skin of his face. ‘The Sisters of this Order that you have manipulated to their deaths!’ With a thump, she brought one hand down on the table, making her effigies and candles jump. ‘You have made a mockery of our very faith.’ The man said, again, ‘I have done nothing wrong! The great gem – it needs energy. Needed ships, supplies, power! Needs to build its forces once more! And it was His voice, His voice!’ The man staggered suddenly to his knees, reached for the hem of the canoness’ grey robe. ‘He spoke to me, milady. He came to me in a vision. A vision of death, and of pure, green light!’ The canoness stared down at him, pitiless. ‘And every time a Sister grew too close, it told you to end her life,’ Augusta said, her tone pure steel. ‘To make of her a sacrifice.’ ‘He spoke to me.’ The man, pleading now, looked from canoness to Sister Superior. ‘He wanted only to help them. He spoke to my father, to my mother, to their parents before them. He–’ ‘Enough.’ The canoness snatched her robe from the man’s grasp, swept it back to herself with a gesture that was all imperious scorn. ‘You have allied yourselves with a xenos power,’ Augusta said, grimly. ‘Caused the deaths of unknown numbers of His faithful. Your life is forfeit–’ ‘Wait,’ the canoness said. ‘Milady?’ ‘I have already said.’ The old lady sounded sad, now, her long years weighing heavy, but her eyes were like chips of flint. ‘We are not warriors, not like yourselves. We do His work, tending to those who have gone before us. But that work is not the work of warfare, it is the work of peace. Of His peace. Of that final peace that is granted in death, and in repose.’ She was staring at the frateris, who had a slow, horrific realisation breaking across his face. ‘I will not grant you that peace, heretic.’ Around Augusta, the squad shifted, understanding. ‘No…’ said the man. Abruptly, the canoness lost her temper. ‘You have made a lie of our very Order! You have taken the tenets of this convent, of its most holy teachings, and you have twisted them, offering them to a xenos power! You have betrayed everything that He means to us, to this world of the sacred dead!’ Now the man was cowering, sobs starting in his chest. His love for the old lady was honest; the shattering of his own lies almost too much to bear. He said, ‘But I had a vision… I was only bringing His blessing…’ ‘Your vision was falsehood,’ Augusta told him, still hard as rock. ‘You are no longer frateris. You are nothing.’ ‘You are nothing,’ the canoness agreed. ‘You will join your fellows in the crypt. And there you will stay. Until your shouts weaken, and your hunger and thirst grow unbearable. Until you find repentance in your heart. And I pray that when you do face Him, you will know your faithlessness and understand humility. In that way, your soul may yet be saved.’ Alcina was nodding, sternly approving. Melia had frowned, but said nothing. ‘And you, milady?’ Augusta asked. ‘What will you do, without your frateris?’ ‘Penance, Sister Superior,’ the canoness responded. ‘We allowed our faith to falter, to be corrupted by this ancient, xenos taint, and we did nothing. We allowed our young Sisters to be tricked to their deaths, and we did nothing. We only celebrated their ascension, knowing not what had caused it. We will offer our own labours in repentance. We will leave this closeted building, as we should have done long ago, and we will tend to the graves ourselves.’ She stopped, thinking for a minute, then finished, ‘I understand you have not yet found your text?’ Comprehending more than the question, Augusta responded, ‘No, milady, we have not. And it would be our honour to stay, even after our mission is completed.’ She looked round at the rest of the squad. ‘This world may yet have foes lurking beneath its surface. They must be sought out, and summarily slain.’ With the faintest flicker of a smile, the canoness nodded. ‘Then perhaps,’ she said, ‘we do have need for warriors, after all.’",

      "content": "Lance-Corporal Gideon Mase had a lho-stick, a packet of rations, and a mess tin of recaff. Well, not ‘recaff’ exactly. They’d mixed it with something, and it tasted like boiled mud… but that was what the quartermaster issued, and moaning was heresy. Mase’s little hexi-stove was still burning, a tiny blue flame like some miniature beacon, and he’d sat his weary arse down on the boot-pounded dirt beside it. Broken buildings towered all around him, many of them heaped into makeshift defences, but here, the ground was flat. He took a long drag on the stick, and blew out a plume of grey. It was late, and finally quiet, thank the Emperor. The sky was dark, and drifting, settling clouds of soot and stone dust were everywhere, getting in his eyes, his mouth, his hair, his kit. He took another drag on the stick, and coughed up black gunk. ‘Nice.’ His squadmate Kewa nudged him with a battered, camo-covered elbow. She was a small, wiry thing, her eyes tired, her face dirty. Like him, she had the rich, purple-black skin of Uvodia III, and her hair, once shorn and dark, now more resembled the tangled filth of Kiros. And of this endless bloody war. His recaff was too hot, and he scalded himself on the metal. ‘Shit!’ The 16th Gavera, known to themselves as the ‘Jags’, had been here on Kiros for almost a Solar year, fighting back and forth, and back and forth; a grinding, endless tedium that never seemed to change. The foe attacked, slobbering forwards, screaming and shrieking; the Jags skirmished out and drove them back. They were an infantry company, stationed on the outermost edge of what had been Kiros’ capital city, and way too bloody far from home. It defied Mase’s understanding: Kiros had no value. It had been an Administratum world, a world of hab-blocks and endless, featureless dormitories of cubicles and tiny offices, their grubby walls inscribed with bureaucratic mottos about the holiness of diligence. Great cathedrals had spiked free from its regulation skyline, along with massive statues and cloud-scraping bell towers that rang the sacred hours of far-distant Holy Terra. Mase’s briefing hadn’t included specifics, but as far as he knew, they were the only things notable about this backwater world. There was nothing here even worth fighting over. At least, not until… He stopped, glanced round, and coughed again. A second lungful of muck spattered his chin. ‘D’you think it’s real?’ he muttered, half under his breath. ‘The holy text, I mean?’ ‘Watch it,’ Kewa told him, grinning. ‘You know we’re not supposed to speculate.’ ‘They were talking in the officers’ mess,’ he said. ‘About some new horror from the warp. It’s here to claim it first – or destroy it.’ Wiping his mouth on the end of his sleeve, he scowled and looked furtive. The platoons had driven back the afternoon’s assault and were now on downtime. Many had already started on bivvies and bedrolls, slinging their ponchos from the remains of the walls, or just wrapping themselves up and going straight to sleep. The metal leg of a patrolling Sentinel caught the faint reflection of the platoon HQ lumen; a distance ahead of him, he could make out the floodlights and field emitters that defended the front line. Mase leaned in, lowering his voice further. ‘I think that’s why they’re here,’ he said. ‘To face it.’ ‘You think they can?’ Kewa asked him. In the tiny light from the hexi-stove, her dark eyes shone. ‘I saw them, earlier today. They were at the centre of the line, right in front of the cath­edral where the plinth is. Fighting like nothing I’ve ever seen. And they’re no bigger than we are, not really.’ Mase was still watching round them. He hissed at her to lower her voice, then said, ‘I thought they’d be huge. Like Space Marines.’ ‘Nah.’ Kewa grinned, winked. ‘I saw one of them, once, too. Did I tell you that? On Aldana, just standing there, like some…’ She shrugged. ‘Colossus. He didn’t move or anything…’ She tailed off as the sergeant came into view. The man still wore his webbing, flak and helmet, but his rifle was slung. ‘You two all right?’ he asked them. His dark skin was filthy, his stone-coloured camo-paint lost under layers of soot. ‘Mase? Kewa? Injuries? Kit failures?’ ‘Can we go home, yet, sarge?’ Kewa asked. ‘Ask the commissar.’ The sergeant gave them both a sarcastic look, and strode off to the next group. She snickered, then lowered her voice once more. ‘They were amazing, Mase. I saw them, cutting their way through literally swathes of monsters. Dozens, hundreds of them. It was incred­ible. And they sing. It’s enough to make your hair stand on end. Watching them…’ She shivered. ‘It was like watching some perfectly blessed war machine.’ ‘You’re jealous,’ Mase realised, grinning. ‘Yeah, maybe a bit.’ Her expression turned rueful, and she shrugged. ‘What must that be like?’ She was looking out across the site now, past the gleam of a waiting tank. ‘That kind of kit, that kind of skill? Do you think the Emperor really speaks to them? Do they get scared, feel pain, the same way that we do?’ She stopped, staring at the semi-darkness. Ends of lho-sticks gleamed, and the occasional hexi-fire. Conversation and hints of weary laughter floated out across the evening wind. ‘You just said they were human,’ Mase told her. ‘I’d been told they were eight feet tall and bit the heads off heretics.’ She snorted. ‘They aren’t like Space Marines. The Sisters of Battle are like… I don’t know… Like watching faith fighting, like holiness incarnate…’ She tailed off, watching the sergeant as he came back into view. He passed them, going the other way, and she turned back to her dumped webbing, rummaging through it. Mase could see the frown on her face, like there was something she wasn’t saying. He didn’t press, it wasn’t his business. Instead, he blew steam and soot off his recaff and wondered if it was cool enough to drink. The Adepta Sororitas, the Sisters of Battle. Here. Speculation had been forbidden but still, his curiosity burned like the hexi. They had come to end the war, said some. To find this holy text, to deny and slay this great beast – whatever it was. To purge the taint from this world, to rebuild its churches and cathedrals, all the way back to its filth-choked sky… Despite the officers’ command, stories had flared through the troops like spreading fires. Conjecture had been rife, percussion shocks of expanding whispers… though if the sergeant heard you muttering, you were likely to get the toe of their boot. But – so many tales! Tales of a hundred battles, a thousand legends! Truly, the Jags were blessed, they and Kiros both. Kewa had found her own hexi and was opening it out, reaching for its block-fuel. His recaff still too hot, Mase took another drag on the lho-stick. He’d heard the stories, of course he had. The Sisters had their own procession, fearsome and wondrous, an icon at the heart of the battle. There were six of them, their armour black, and they bore the very saint herself, the bones of Holy Katherine. A flock of cherubim circled them like a moving halo, bearing prayer-banners and other things, things Mase did not know. And the darkness… they said that the darkness, the very clouds, fled before them like a thing defeated, like a receding tide. Where the Sisters strode, they carried His light, the light of Sol and of Terra, and the foe cowered… The thought made his heart race and his breath catch – surely, now, the end of this war must be in sight? The long-beleaguered Jags had a sharp point to their blunt hammer, the strength of blade, bolter and holy benediction– He caught himself, calmed his thoughts. Kewa’s irreverence was known – it had got her in trouble before – but they both needed to watch themselves. He saw all your thoughts, after all, every last flicker. Perhaps, Mase thought, the Sisters could see them, too. The idea made him shiver. His lho-stick burned his fingers and he swore, flicking its end in the hexi. Beside him, Kewa was cooking her ration pack, soot and all. She whistled through her teeth, a tuneless rendition of a Militarum marching song. They sing… And it was not just the procession. There were other Sisters here too: squads deployed to protect the Militarum’s flanks. Their armour was likewise black, their cloaks red, and they fought fearlessly, hurling themselves at the foe. He’d seen them earlier, from the corner of his eye, seen them move like… Again, he caught himself. A distance away, only visible by the light of its electro-sconces, was their Order’s battle sanctum, sacred and off limits, the towering cathedral one of the few buildings still half-intact. It was defended by four faceless, armoured figures, and he worried that they would hear if he thought too loud. He put a hand to the talisman in his jacket. It was a little thing, a carved effigy of the Emperor that he’d made himself, when he’d been stuck in a mudhole on the Salyon moon. It gave him hope – made him believe that they could win this. In the end. He was taking another tentative sip when the monster struck. It came out of nothing, as if born from the darkness. And it fell upon Kewa, ripping her clean in half. Hot gore slicked Mase’s skin. Casting her shredded pieces scornfully aside, it leered down at him, grinning. By His name, it stank. For the tiniest moment, Mase gawked. Then: mayhem. Reflexes swift, he was shouting the alarm, hurling the still-steaming recaff, mess tin and all, into the thing’s face. With instincts drilled into him from years of training, he went straight for his lasrifle, always at his right-hand side. Shouts and movement came through the darkness; the rest of the platoon were on their feet, already running. In the vox, the sergeant was barking orders, questions, but he was too far away. Everyone was too far away. But, with His blessing, the recaff had been enough, just enough, to make the thing pause. It had claws and a grotesque face, semi-human, but teeth in all the wrong places. Its skin was rotted and sloughing off where the liquid had burned it; its compound eyes were red and swelling. It hissed at him, but he had the rifle now and was bringing it up, ready to fire. He was too close. He smacked the rifle-butt neatly into its claws, and it grabbed and pulled, snarling. Still on his arse, Mase scrabbled backwards, trying to reclaim the weapon. He shouted into the vox, ‘Mase! To me! To me!’ Alarums blared, and the patrolling Sentinel’s lumens flared in his direction. There was the distinctive click-click of its weapons tracking – though it surely wouldn’t fire at its own campsite. A second, bigger floodlight snapped his way, dazzling. And– By the Emperor! He saw her, he saw her, right there, like a vision: an armoured silhouette, the glare behind her. Her helm shone, her black armour glowed at its edges, her red cloak billowed as if she were framed by blood. A Sister of Battle. He had no idea how she’d got there; she was surely a ­miracle. But He had seen fit, for whatever reason, to spare Mase’s humble life. ‘Get back.’ In the vox, her voice sounded young, but it was impossible to tell. The bolter in her hand shone like His blessing as she raised it and blasted the thing full in the chest. Fluids splattered, the hexi went out. Mase managed to scrabble to his feet, freeing his rifle at last, but she was already between him and the beast. The rest of the platoon had stopped dead. ‘Hold your fire!’ The sergeant barked the order, but the command was unnecessary. The Sister was too close to the beast. She ignored them. The thing was still moving, still hissing. Ichor dripped from its body, its mouldering skin. A burst of hymnal came from her, as bright as the bolter’s flare; she shot again, and again. It slashed at her, once, twice, with two heavy, claw-tipped arms. Scrapes screeched across her armour. What in His name was this creature? But she did not pause, her song did not falter. She pressed forwards, pace by pace, indomitable, shooting it again, again, again. It did not retreat. Its teeth closed on her helm, skidded off. The claws flashed at her pauldrons, putting dents in the ceramite. She shot it a fifth time, a sixth, and finally, it began to weaken, its knees giving way. ‘Sarge?’ A shocked voice came through the darkness. ‘Full perimeter defence!’ The sergeant’s bark was edged. ‘Don’t let any more through!’ Mase, gawping, had stopped, his rifle clutched in one nerveless hand. The thing was struggling, still trying to slash at her legs as it went down, but she was a flare of cloak, a wall of armour. As she moved, the floodlight picked out the scraps of parchment fixed to its surfaces, each one inscribed with a prayer. Her bolter glinted like resolution. At last, the thing tumbled. With a grim resolve, she put one black boot on its shoulder and shot downwards, right in its face. It spluttered, gagged, and went still. Nothing moved. The sergeant stood silent, staring; Mase could see his filthy, shocked face in the harsh glare of the floodlight. His shadow angled out along the ground, hard as determination. The Sister, still not paying them any attention, kicked the thing over, put another shot into its skull. Then she turned to where Mase stood, his hands still wrapped round his unused rifle as if it were the only thing that made sense in this insane world. ‘Are you hurt?’ she asked him. ‘I…’ He had no idea what he was supposed to call her – milady, ma’am? Did she have a rank? He could see no recognisable insignia. ‘No, Sister.’ It seemed to be the safest thing to say. ‘Good.’ Her helm moved and she was looking down at Kewa, shredded like so much fabric. In the rush, Mase had not looked at her and suddenly he faltered as her loss, the nearness of his own miss, hit him like a fist in the temple. He found himself on his knees, throwing up a stream of sooty bile. Kewa’s eyes were glass, empty. Dirt was already ­settling in them. And her torso… He looked away, and tried not to throw up again. ‘Do not be concerned,’ the Sister told him gently. He glanced up, blinking. ‘She died facing the foe,’ the Sister said. ‘She stands before the Throne in honour and in His grace. You should grieve for her, as is proper, but have no fear for her soul. Her time of strife is done, and she may rest.’ There was a burr of pain in her voice, human, and oddly touching. Numbly, he nodded. ‘Yes, Sister. Thank you, Sister.’ ‘All right, lad.’ The sergeant’s hand came down on Mase’s shoulder. ‘Fun’s over. Sister, we owe you our gratitude.’ ‘It’s why I’m here, sergeant,’ she said. ‘A service will be held at twenty-one hundred, Terran standard. With what you have just witnessed, I will expect you to attend.’ ‘Thank you, Sister,’ the sergeant said, again. He poked a boot at Mase, and Mase belatedly remembered his manners. ‘Yes… thank you, Sister,’ he repeated. ‘I will… ah… attend, of course.’ He was stuttering. Was he supposed to salute her? He made the effort to stand up, though his legs still shook. The sergeant was already shouting. ‘All right, listen up! Peri­meter defences doubled! And I want to know how in the name of the Emper… ah’ – he remembered himself – ‘how that thing got through here!’ ‘They crawl,’ the Sister said. ‘Belly down in the darkness, and slithering. They are cunning, and can affect both your mind and your heart. Be vigilant, sergeant, and hold Him in your thoughts, always.’ The sergeant offered an aquila salute. ‘Understood.’ ‘Know that He is with you, on Kiros, and all across the galaxy.’ She paused, and Mase almost heard her smile. ‘The battle for this world will not go on forever. We are here to see it ended.’ The sergeant returned, ‘Sister. Ave Imperator.’ But Mase could say nothing more, had nothing more to say. Rather than looking down at the remains of his fallen comrade, he watched the Sister’s armoured figure as it turned, taking in the sight. The odd burr of pain was back in her voice as she said, ‘His bless­ing upon you.’ And then she walked away, her black armour still shining as if it carried His very promise. Careful not to make it audible, Mase let out his breath. The sergeant raised an eyebrow. ‘Don’t let it go to your head, son,’ he said. ‘Find a gunny sack, and we’ll put Kewa with the others. And you heard what she said – you be at that service!’ ‘Sarge.’ A couple of his platoon-mates were lingering, questions on all their faces, but they could wait. If Kewa lay with Him, then he owed it to her memory to tend to her properly. Turning from the battered Militarum soldiers, Sister Avra felt a stab of regret. She belonged to the Order of Our Martyred Lady, and her death in combat was expected, the highest honour. But not here, not now. Her life had been refused, and instead, her sacred black armour was scratched and dented. The damage pressed inwards, hard lines of failure against the padding she wore. She knew she should return to the sanctum, but there was a coil of hurt in her heart. Understand your instincts, child, her schola tutors had taught her – had it only been two Solar years before? They come from Him, they are your teachers, and they will show you much. She walked on, a prayer on her lips, seeking His wisdom. Avra’s Order were the faithful of Saint Katherine, deployed to Kiros to end the war. The mission was not unusual, but when she had learned the full brief, about the presence of the saint herself… In His name, she could never have dreamed of such a blessing! The Triumph of Saint Katherine, the saint’s very bones, borne in holy and ceaseless procession, out across the galaxy – it was here. A beacon of courage, guarded by six Sisters, exemplars and representatives. They were chosen by Him to stand with the saint and to carry her strength forth, to proclaim her name and His light! In the chapel of the Sword of Bridiga, Avra had fallen to her knees, unworthy, blessed, elated, overcome. Her heart had rung with song, a threnody that may have been either celebration or lament. She prayed, humbly but with longing, that she may even see the saint for herself – she and her Sisters were taking turns as honour guard. And she’d prayed, even harder, for the chance to offer her life. Stepping past the scattered bivouacs, mess tents, armouries, communications hubs, she used her preysight to watch for more of the crawling beasts. The company enginseer flowed past her, ducking from her way, though his attendant servo-skulls and mechadendrites all turned to follow her. Like everything else, his red cloak was covered with soot. Somewhere, soldiers’ voices were raised in raucous song. It was a hymn, but sung as only the Militarum could manage. She controlled a twitch of a smile. Avra had been raised on Fura IV, bleak and severe. Her father and brother had been Third Furan Rangers, but her mother had given her life for her family, dying in childbirth as Avra’s brother was born. Avra had been six, her mother’s death a moment of great questioning and even greater, unshakable faith. Even now, Avra ached to be worthy of such sacrifice… Ached to be worthy of her saint. Fully identifying her curl of disappointment, she paused, chastising herself for the unworthiness of her thought. Her life was not hers to discard, even in battle. Her death was His, in His hands, at His will. Her martyrdom would happen as He decreed, in the proper time, and in the proper place. Walk with us, O Emperor. Her thoughts calmer, she glanced around. Her restless, introspective walking had taken her to the outermost edge of the encampment, within blessed sight of where the Sisters of the Triumph of Saint Katherine had established their own sanctum – taking over a tiny local chapel, its walls and tower all mosaicked with shattered ceramic. It was beautiful, brightly coloured and unique. Its minute windows shone with the light of the saint within. Avra dropped to her knees, her gauntleted hands tracing a fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour. She had never thought she would be this close, had never dreamed that she would witness this hallowed miracle, let alone be blessed enough to walk behind it. She intended to bow her head – but the windows flared with His light, and the sight before her was lost. She stands upon a battlefield, ablaze with wrath and fury. She wields a blade that carves limbs and heads and flesh. She bears a great shield against which the foe shatters, tumbling in dust and fragments. And those fragments fuse together, each one melding with its fellows. They become stones, become rocks, become walls. Become the crystal glassaic of a great cathedral’s windows. Fire bathes her; it flares from her armour, from her very heart. She burns, but the pain is good, like the purity of total immolation. In the flame-light, the glassaic windows are brought to life, every one an image. In one: an agri world, rippling with crops. In another: a convent, quiet and secluded. In a third: the kneeling forms of Sisters, robes pooled upon a flagstone floor. And there are more: a man, radiant with dark power and terrible authority. Trust and truth that char right through, like fluttering pieces of fabric. The sickening lurch of a terrible, soul-devastating betrayal. And then more: a duel, upon which the galaxy waits. The windows cannot contain the images. They waver and melt, and their running, puddled colours reflect the clouds. They become steam, and are gone. And still, she burns. But now, her agony is glorious. She becomes a hymn, raised to a darkness-filled sky. Buildings burn, pillars of smoke rise as if they hold up the very clouds. Further and further spreads the maze of burning streets, stretching back to impossible distance. It is all about her, but she is its hub and its centre and she stands, she always stands… The shield is back in her hand, but now, she bears her sword in the other. She slays the rising monster. The young soldier is her brother for whom her mother died, her still-youthful father; he may be but one tiny speck upon the surface of the Emperor’s Hammer, but he matters. They all matter. Comprehension hits her like a blaze of truth, like a bone spur. She feels her gorget give, feels that cold spur as it spikes sideways through her throat. As it carves out the side of her neck. Her flame gouts, wild and fervent. Her song hits its crescendo, with power to shatter walls. The monsters cower before her. The song is her requiem. She feels her carotid artery as it bursts, feels her lifeblood pouring forth. It is His greatest blessing, His answer, the thing she had come seeking. ‘Thank you,’ says her fiery heart. ‘Thank you.’ She smells the faintest wisp of incense. Then the flame flares dazzling, and she burns away. Click here to buy The Triumph of Saint Katherine.",

It was a little thing, a carved effigy of the Emperor that he’d made himself, when he’d been stuck in a mudhole on the Salyon moon. It gave him hope – made him believe that they could win this. In the end. He was taking another tentative sip when the monster struck. It came out of nothing, as if born from the darkness. And it fell upon Kewa, ripping her clean in half. Hot gore slicked Mase’s skin. Casting her shredded pieces scornfully aside, it leered down at him, grinning. By His name, it stank. For the tiniest moment, Mase gawked. Then: mayhem. Reflexes swift, he was shouting the alarm, hurling the still-steaming recaff, mess tin and all, into the thing’s face. With instincts drilled into him from years of training, he went straight for his lasrifle, always at his right-hand side. Shouts and movement came through the darkness; the rest of the platoon were on their feet, already running. In the vox, the sergeant was barking orders, questions, but he was too far away. Everyone was too far away. But, with His blessing, the recaff had been enough, just enough, to make the thing pause. It had claws and a grotesque face, semi-human, but teeth in all the wrong places. Its skin was rotted and sloughing off where the liquid had burned it; its compound eyes were red and swelling. It hissed at him, but he had the rifle now and was bringing it up, ready to fire. He was too close. He smacked the rifle-butt neatly into its claws, and it grabbed and pulled, snarling. Still on his arse, Mase scrabbled backwards, trying to reclaim the weapon. He shouted into the vox, ‘Mase! To me! To me!’ Alarums blared, and the patrolling Sentinel’s lumens flared in his direction. There was the distinctive click-click of its weapons tracking – though it surely wouldn’t fire at its own campsite. A second, bigger floodlight snapped his way, dazzling. And– By the Emperor! He saw her, he saw her, right there, like a vision: an armoured silhouette, the glare behind her. Her helm shone, her black armour glowed at its edges, her red cloak billowed as if she were framed by blood. A Sister of Battle. He had no idea how she’d got there; she was surely a ­miracle. But He had seen fit, for whatever reason, to spare Mase’s humble life. ‘Get back.’ In the vox, her voice sounded young, but it was impossible to tell. The bolter in her hand shone like His blessing as she raised it and blasted the thing full in the chest. Fluids splattered, the hexi went out. Mase managed to scrabble to his feet, freeing his rifle at last, but she was already between him and the beast. The rest of the platoon had stopped dead. ‘Hold your fire!’ The sergeant barked the order, but the command was unnecessary. The Sister was too close to the beast. She ignored them. The thing was still moving, still hissing. Ichor dripped from its body, its mouldering skin. A burst of hymnal came from her, as bright as the bolter’s flare; she shot again, and again. It slashed at her, once, twice, with two heavy, claw-tipped arms. Scrapes screeched across her armour. What in His name was this creature? But she did not pause, her song did not falter. She pressed forwards, pace by pace, indomitable, shooting it again, again, again. It did not retreat. Its teeth closed on her helm, skidded off. The claws flashed at her pauldrons, putting dents in the ceramite. She shot it a fifth time, a sixth, and finally, it began to weaken, its knees giving way. ‘Sarge?’ A shocked voice came through the darkness. ‘Full perimeter defence!’ The sergeant’s bark was edged. ‘Don’t let any more through!’ Mase, gawping, had stopped, his rifle clutched in one nerveless hand. The thing was struggling, still trying to slash at her legs as it went down, but she was a flare of cloak, a wall of armour. As she moved, the floodlight picked out the scraps of parchment fixed to its surfaces, each one inscribed with a prayer. Her bolter glinted like resolution. At last, the thing tumbled. With a grim resolve, she put one black boot on its shoulder and shot downwards, right in its face. It spluttered, gagged, and went still. Nothing moved. The sergeant stood silent, staring; Mase could see his filthy, shocked face in the harsh glare of the floodlight. His shadow angled out along the ground, hard as determination. The Sister, still not paying them any attention, kicked the thing over, put another shot into its skull. Then she turned to where Mase stood, his hands still wrapped round his unused rifle as if it were the only thing that made sense in this insane world. ‘Are you hurt?’ she asked him. ‘I…’ He had no idea what he was supposed to call her – milady, ma’am? Did she have a rank? He could see no recognisable insignia. ‘No, Sister.’ It seemed to be the safest thing to say. ‘Good.’ Her helm moved and she was looking down at Kewa, shredded like so much fabric. In the rush, Mase had not looked at her and suddenly he faltered as her loss, the nearness of his own miss, hit him like a fist in the temple. He found himself on his knees, throwing up a stream of sooty bile. Kewa’s eyes were glass, empty. Dirt was already ­settling in them. And her torso… He looked away, and tried not to throw up again. ‘Do not be concerned,’ the Sister told him gently. He glanced up, blinking. ‘She died facing the foe,’ the Sister said. ‘She stands before the Throne in honour and in His grace. You should grieve for her, as is proper, but have no fear for her soul. Her time of strife is done, and she may rest.’ There was a burr of pain in her voice, human, and oddly touching. Numbly, he nodded. ‘Yes, Sister. Thank you, Sister.’ ‘All right, lad.’ The sergeant’s hand came down on Mase’s shoulder. ‘Fun’s over. Sister, we owe you our gratitude.’ ‘It’s why I’m here, sergeant,’ she said. ‘A service will be held at twenty-one hundred, Terran standard. With what you have just witnessed, I will expect you to attend.’ ‘Thank you, Sister,’ the sergeant said, again. He poked a boot at Mase, and Mase belatedly remembered his manners. ‘Yes… thank you, Sister,’ he repeated. ‘I will… ah… attend, of course.’ He was stuttering. Was he supposed to salute her? He made the effort to stand up, though his legs still shook. The sergeant was already shouting. ‘All right, listen up! Peri­meter defences doubled! And I want to know how in the name of the Emper… ah’ – he remembered himself – ‘how that thing got through here!’ ‘They crawl,’ the Sister said. ‘Belly down in the darkness, and slithering. They are cunning, and can affect both your mind and your heart. Be vigilant, sergeant, and hold Him in your thoughts, always.’ The sergeant offered an aquila salute. ‘Understood.’ ‘Know that He is with you, on Kiros, and all across the galaxy.’ She paused, and Mase almost heard her smile. ‘The battle for this world will not go on forever. We are here to see it ended.’ The sergeant returned, ‘Sister. Ave Imperator.’ But Mase could say nothing more, had nothing more to say. Rather than looking down at the remains of his fallen comrade, he watched the Sister’s armoured figure as it turned, taking in the sight. The odd burr of pain was back in her voice as she said, ‘His bless­ing upon you.’ And then she walked away, her black armour still shining as if it carried His very promise. Careful not to make it audible, Mase let out his breath. The sergeant raised an eyebrow. ‘Don’t let it go to your head, son,’ he said. ‘Find a gunny sack, and we’ll put Kewa with the others. And you heard what she said – you be at that service!’ ‘Sarge.’ A couple of his platoon-mates were lingering, questions on all their faces, but they could wait. If Kewa lay with Him, then he owed it to her memory to tend to her properly. Turning from the battered Militarum soldiers, Sister Avra felt a stab of regret. She belonged to the Order of Our Martyred Lady, and her death in combat was expected, the highest honour. But not here, not now. Her life had been refused, and instead, her sacred black armour was scratched and dented. The damage pressed inwards, hard lines of failure against the padding she wore. She knew she should return to the sanctum, but there was a coil of hurt in her heart. Understand your instincts, child, her schola tutors had taught her – had it only been two Solar years before? They come from Him, they are your teachers, and they will show you much. She walked on, a prayer on her lips, seeking His wisdom. Avra’s Order were the faithful of Saint Katherine, deployed to Kiros to end the war. The mission was not unusual, but when she had learned the full brief, about the presence of the saint herself… In His name, she could never have dreamed of such a blessing! The Triumph of Saint Katherine, the saint’s very bones, borne in holy and ceaseless procession, out across the galaxy – it was here. A beacon of courage, guarded by six Sisters, exemplars and representatives. They were chosen by Him to stand with the saint and to carry her strength forth, to proclaim her name and His light! In the chapel of the Sword of Bridiga, Avra had fallen to her knees, unworthy, blessed, elated, overcome. Her heart had rung with song, a threnody that may have been either celebration or lament. She prayed, humbly but with longing, that she may even see the saint for herself – she and her Sisters were taking turns as honour guard. And she’d prayed, even harder, for the chance to offer her life. Stepping past the scattered bivouacs, mess tents, armouries, communications hubs, she used her preysight to watch for more of the crawling beasts. The company enginseer flowed past her, ducking from her way, though his attendant servo-skulls and mechadendrites all turned to follow her. Like everything else, his red cloak was covered with soot. Somewhere, soldiers’ voices were raised in raucous song. It was a hymn, but sung as only the Militarum could manage. She controlled a twitch of a smile. Avra had been raised on Fura IV, bleak and severe. Her father and brother had been Third Furan Rangers, but her mother had given her life for her family, dying in childbirth as Avra’s brother was born. Avra had been six, her mother’s death a moment of great questioning and even greater, unshakable faith. Even now, Avra ached to be worthy of such sacrifice… Ached to be worthy of her saint. Fully identifying her curl of disappointment, she paused, chastising herself for the unworthiness of her thought. Her life was not hers to discard, even in battle. Her death was His, in His hands, at His will. Her martyrdom would happen as He decreed, in the proper time, and in the proper place. Walk with us, O Emperor. Her thoughts calmer, she glanced around. Her restless, introspective walking had taken her to the outermost edge of the encampment, within blessed sight of where the Sisters of the Triumph of Saint Katherine had established their own sanctum – taking over a tiny local chapel, its walls and tower all mosaicked with shattered ceramic. It was beautiful, brightly coloured and unique. Its minute windows shone with the light of the saint within. Avra dropped to her knees, her gauntleted hands tracing a fleur-de-lys on the front of her armour. She had never thought she would be this close, had never dreamed that she would witness this hallowed miracle, let alone be blessed enough to walk behind it. She intended to bow her head – but the windows flared with His light, and the sight before her was lost. She stands upon a battlefield, ablaze with wrath and fury. She wields a blade that carves limbs and heads and flesh. She bears a great shield against which the foe shatters, tumbling in dust and fragments. And those fragments fuse together, each one melding with its fellows. They become stones, become rocks, become walls. Become the crystal glassaic of a great cathedral’s windows. Fire bathes her; it flares from her armour, from her very heart. She burns, but the pain is good, like the purity of total immolation. In the flame-light, the glassaic windows are brought to life, every one an image. In one: an agri world, rippling with crops. In another: a convent, quiet and secluded. In a third: the kneeling forms of Sisters, robes pooled upon a flagstone floor. And there are more: a man, radiant with dark power and terrible authority. Trust and truth that char right through, like fluttering pieces of fabric. The sickening lurch of a terrible, soul-devastating betrayal. And then more: a duel, upon which the galaxy waits. The windows cannot contain the images. They waver and melt, and their running, puddled colours reflect the clouds. They become steam, and are gone. And still, she burns. But now, her agony is glorious. She becomes a hymn, raised to a darkness-filled sky. Buildings burn, pillars of smoke rise as if they hold up the very clouds. Further and further spreads the maze of burning streets, stretching back to impossible distance. It is all about her, but she is its hub and its centre and she stands, she always stands… The shield is back in her hand, but now, she bears her sword in the other. She slays the rising monster. The young soldier is her brother for whom her mother died, her still-youthful father; he may be but one tiny speck upon the surface of the Emperor’s Hammer, but he matters. They all matter. Comprehension hits her like a blaze of truth, like a bone spur. She feels her gorget give, feels that cold spur as it spikes sideways through her throat. As it carves out the side of her neck. Her flame gouts, wild and fervent. Her song hits its crescendo, with power to shatter walls. The monsters cower before her. The song is her requiem. She feels her carotid artery as it bursts, feels her lifeblood pouring forth. It is His greatest blessing, His answer, the thing she had come seeking. ‘Thank you,’ says her fiery heart. ‘Thank you.’ She smells the faintest wisp of incense. Then the flame flares dazzling, and she burns away. Click here to buy The Triumph of Saint Katherine.",
